7.1.8.1	Corals in Hot Water
7.1.9.1	Coral reefs support the largest diversity of life in the oceans.
7.1.9.2	They provide fisheries and storm protection for about a billion people, and are a magnificent source of natural beauty.
7.1.9.3	But coral reefs are endangered.
7.1.9.4	Over the past 20 years about half of the world   s reef-building corals have been destroyed by rising water temperature and other factors.
7.1.9.5	High temperatures disrupt a fascinating aspect of coral biology.
7.1.9.6	Corals are animals, yet most corals have algae (dinoflagellates) growing within their cells.
7.1.9.7	Dinoflagellates use the energy of sunlight to produce carbohydrates.
7.1.9.8	Corals provide a home for the dinoflagellates, which in turn provide nutrients for the corals.
7.1.9.9	When high temperature impairs the dinoflagellates, the corals eject them   a process called bleaching.
7.1.9.10	Then, without nutrients from the dinoflagellates, the corals die, unless they can take in new dinoflagellates that are more resistant to the higher temperatures.
7.1.10.1	Understanding the effects of heat on corals was the motivation of graduate student Rachael Bay and her colleagues working with Professor Steve Palumbi at Stanford University   s Hopkins Marine Station.
7.1.10.2	While studying corals in small back-reef pools in American Samoa, they observed that during low tides some pools reached higher temperatures than others.
7.1.10.3	The researchers predicted that corals in the warmer pools had mechanisms enabling them to resist bleaching.
7.1.10.4	To test their prediction, the researchers brought corals into the laboratory, subjected them to temperature fluctuations, and showed that the corals from the warm pools were more resistant to bleaching.
7.1.10.5	They also transplanted corals between the different temperature environments in nature.
7.1.10.6	As a result of these experiments, Rachael and her colleagues proposed that two different processes contribute to the different abilities of the corals to survive heat stress.
7.1.10.7	First, corals growing in the warmer pools could have genetic traits contributing to heat resistance, and second, individual corals may have the same genetic make-up but differ in their ability to adjust to their environment by changing the expression levels of certain genes.
7.1.10.8	More knowledge of the mechanisms of heat stress and heat resistance in corals could lead to new strategies to decrease their losses as their environments change.
7.1.11.1	How might experiments on heat stress in corals be used to predict the response of corals to global warming?

7.1.13.1	1.1 Living Organisms Share Similarities and a Common Origin
7.1.1.1.1	Life arose from non-life via chemical evolution
7.1.1.2.1	Cellular structure evolved in the common ancestor of life
7.1.1.3.1	Photosynthesis allows some organisms to capture energy from the sun
7.1.1.4.1	Biological information is stored in a genetic code common to all organisms
7.1.1.5.1	Populations of all living organisms evolve
7.1.1.6.1	Biologists trace the evolutionary tree of life
7.1.1.7.1	Cellular differentiation and specialization underlie multicellular life
7.1.1.8.1	Organisms extract energy and raw materials from the environment
7.1.1.9.1	Living organisms must regulate their internal environment
7.1.1.10.1	Living organisms interact Intuitively we all know what life is, but try to define it; it isn   t easy.
7.1.1.10.2	You can easily designate the things around you as living or nonliving, but what are the essential differences?
7.1.1.10.3	We call the living things organisms.
7.1.1.10.4	In contrast to nonliving things, organisms sustain and renew themselves.
7.1.1.10.5	The loss of the ability to sustain and renew means the loss of life, and organisms that die become part of the nonliving world.
7.1.1.10.6	Biology is the scientific study of organisms, both living and after death (e. g. , the study of fossils) with the goal of discovering and understanding the diversity and the complex processes that make up life.
7.1.1.11.1	focus your learning
7.1.1.12.1	Major characteristics are shared among all living things.
7.1.1.13.1	Living organisms have influenced the history of the planet Earth.
7.1.1.14.1	Biological populations change over time.
7.1.1.15.1	Figure 1.1 The Many Faces of Life
7.1.1.16.1	The processes of evolution have led to the millions of diverse organisms living on Earth today.
7.1.1.16.2	Prokaryotic archaea (A) and bacteria (B) are all single-celled organisms, as described in Chapter 25.
7.1.1.16.3	(C) Many protists are unicellular but, as discussed in Chapter 26, their cell structures are more complex than those of the prokaryotes.
7.1.1.16.4	This protist has manufactured    plates  ? of calcium carbonate that surround and protect its single cell.
7.1.1.16.5	(D   G) Most of the visible life on Earth is multicellular.
7.1.1.16.6	Chapters 27 and 28 cover the green plants (D).
7.1.1.16.7	The other broad groups of multicellular organisms are the fungi (E), discussed in Chapter 29, and the animals (F), covered in Chapters 30   32.
7.1.1.16.8	Life on our planet is quite diverse (Figure 1.1), yet its many diverse forms share common features.
7.1.1.16.9	What characteristics do organisms share that distinguish them from the nonliving world?
7.1.1.16.10	Most organisms:
7.1.1.17.1	are composed of a common set of chemical compounds: mainly carbohydrates, fatty acids, nucleic acids, and amino acids.
7.1.1.18.1	are made up of cells.
7.1.1.19.1	use molecules obtained from the environment to synthesize new biological molecules.
7.1.1.20.1	extract energy from the environment and use it to do work.
7.1.1.21.1	contain genetic information   genomes   that enables them to develop, maintain themselves, function, and reproduce.
7.1.1.22.1	use a universal molecular code to build proteins from their genomic information.
7.1.1.23.1	regulate their internal environments.
7.1.1.24.1	exist in populations that evolve over time.
7.1.1.24.2	How do you think all organisms came to have these similarities?
7.1.1.24.3	If life had multiple origins, we would not expect to see such striking similarities in chemical composition, cell structure, cell functions, and genetic codes across the living world.
7.1.1.24.4	Instead, these common characteristics logically lead to the conclusion that all life has a common ancestry, and that the diverse organisms alive today all originated from one life form.
7.1.1.24.5	Organisms from a separate origin of life   say, on another planet   might be similar in superficial ways to life on Earth, but they would not have the same genetic code, chemical composition, or cellular structures and functions that we see widely shared among living organisms on Earth.
7.1.1.24.6	All evidence points to a common origin of life on our planet about 4 billion years ago.
7.1.1.24.7	Some forms of life may not display all characteristics listed above all of the time.
7.1.1.24.8	For example, the seed of a desert plant may go for many years without extracting energy from the environment, converting molecules, regulating its internal environment, or reproducing; yet the seed is alive.
7.1.1.24.9	Viruses present a special case as well.
7.1.1.24.10	Viruses are not composed of cells and cannot carry out physiological functions on their own.
7.1.1.24.11	Viruses depend on the cells of host organisms to carry out these functions for them.
7.1.1.24.12	Yet viruses contain genetic information, and their populations evolve over time, as we know from witnessing changes in the flu viruses each flu season.
7.1.1.24.13	Even though viruses are not independent cellular organisms, their existence depends on cells, and it is highly probable that viruses evolved from cellular life forms.
7.1.1.24.14	Thus most biologists consider viruses to be a part of life.
7.1.1.24.15	As you go through this book, you will explore details of the common characteristics of life, how these characteristics arose, and how they work together so that organisms survive and reproduce.
7.1.1.24.16	Because organisms do not all survive and reproduce with equal success, you will see again and again that through differential survival and reproduction populations of organisms evolve and become adapted to Earth   s many environments.
7.1.1.24.17	The processes of evolution have generated the enormous diversity of life on Earth, and evolution is a central theme of biology.
7.1.0.0.1.1	Earth formed between 4.6 and 4.5 billion years ago, but it was not a place hospitable to life.
7.1.0.0.1.2	The cooling of Earth, the formation of surface water, and the evolution of the first life forms took about 600 million years.
7.1.0.0.1.3	If we picture the 4.6-billion-year history of Earth as a 30-day month, life first appeared some time around the end of the first week (Figure 1.2).
7.1.0.0.1.4	Figure 1.2 Life   s Timeline The young Earth   s atmosphere, oceans, and climate were very different than they are today, but experiments simulating those conditions have confirmed that the generation of complex molecules through random physical association of chemicals is possible, even inevitable.
7.1.0.0.1.5	The critical step for the evolution of life was the appearance of nucleic acids   molecules that could reproduce themselves and serve as templates for the synthesis of proteins, large molecules with complex but stable shapes.
7.1.0.0.1.6	The variation in the shapes of these proteins enabled them to participate in increasing numbers and kinds of chemical reactions with other molecules.
7.1.0.0.1.7	These subjects are covered in Part One of this book.
7.1.0.0.1.1	An important step in the evolution of life was the enclosure of complex proteins and other biological molecules by membranes that contained them in a compact internal environment separate from the surrounding (external) environment.
7.1.0.0.1.2	Fatty acid molecules played a critical role in membrane evolution because these molecules do not dissolve in water.
7.1.0.0.1.3	Think of shaking an oil and vinegar salad dressing.
7.1.0.0.1.4	The oil breaks up into small droplets, but the droplets do not dissolve in the vinegar and they rapidly coalesce.
7.1.0.0.1.5	Similarly, fatty acids can form membranous films on the surface of water.
7.1.0.0.1.6	When these films are agitated, they can form spherical structures called liposomes.
7.1.0.0.1.7	Such structures are now used for delivering drugs to cells (Figure 1.3A).
7.1.0.0.1.8	In a primordial ocean, such membranous structures could have enveloped assemblages of complex biological molecules.
7.1.0.0.1.9	The origin of an internal environment that concentrated reactants and products of chemical reactions led to the first cells with the ability to replicate themselves   the evolution of the first cellular organisms.
7.1.0.0.2.1	Figure 1.3 Cells Are Building Blocks for Life These photographs were taken with electron microscopes (see Figure 5.3) and enhanced with added color to highlight details.
7.1.0.0.2.2	(A) Liposomes are tiny round bubbles known as vesicles and are made out of the same material as a cell membrane.
7.1.0.0.2.3	Liposomes can be filled with drugs and used to deliver drugs to cells.
7.1.0.0.2.4	(B) Two prokaryotic cells of an Enterococcus bacterium that lives in the human digestive system.
7.1.0.0.2.5	Prokaryotes are unicellular organisms with genetic and biochemical material enclosed inside a single membrane.
7.1.0.0.2.6	(C) A human white blood cell (lymphocyte) represents one of the many specialized cell types that make up a multicellular eukaryote.
7.1.0.0.2.7	Multiple membranes within the cell-enclosing outer membrane segregate the different biochemical processes of eukaryotic cells.
7.1.0.0.2.8	For billions of years all the organisms existing on Earth were unicellular and were enclosed by a single outer membrane.
7.1.0.0.2.9	Such organisms, like the bacteria that are abundant on you, in you, and all around you, are called prokaryotes (Figure 1.3B).
7.1.0.0.2.10	Two main groups diverged early in life   s history: the Bacteria and Archaea.
7.1.0.0.2.11	The third major category of life on earth, the Eukarya, arose billions of years later from one group of archaea.
7.1.0.0.2.12	In addition to its outer membrane, a eukaryotic cell (Figure 1.3C) has internal membranes that enclose specialized internal compartments called organelles.
7.1.0.0.2.13	The organelle that gives eukaryotes their name is the nucleus   the organelle that contains the cell   s genetic information.
7.1.0.0.2.14	The word    eukaryote  ? comes from two Greek words meaning    a true kernel.  ?
7.1.0.0.2.15	Other organelles carry out specific functions such as synthesizing biological molecules or providing energy.
7.1.0.0.2.16	How might eukaryotes have arisen from prokaryotes?
7.1.0.0.2.17	Infoldings of the prokaryote cell membrane could have formed internal compartments   the organelles   that isolated cell functions from each other, resulting in greater integration or efficiency of cell functions.
7.1.0.0.2.18	Another possibility, similar to that seen in the relationship between corals and dinoflagellates described at the beginning of this chapter, is that close, interdependent relationships may have developed between different prokaryote cells, leading to a merger of sorts.
7.1.0.0.2.19	Suppose a prokaryote good at converting energy was engulfed (but not digested) by a prokaryote good at synthesizing biological molecules.
7.1.0.0.2.20	Each would supply a valuable service for the other, but now one would be an organelle inside the other.
7.1.0.0.2.21	The structure of prokaryote and eukaryote cells, their membranes, and their evolution are the subjects of Part Two.
7.1.0.0.2.22	Single-celled organisms were the only forms of life for over half of the history of life on Earth (see Figure 1.2).
7.1.0.0.2.23	However, at some point the cells of some eukaryotes didn   t separate after cell division, instead they remained attached to each other.
7.1.0.0.2.24	Such colonial aggregations of cells made it possible for some of the associated cells to specialize in certain functions, such as reproduction, while other cells specialized in other functions, such as absorbing nutrients or motility.
7.1.0.0.2.25	This cellular specialization enabled multicellular eukaryotes to increase in size and become more efficient at gathering resources and adapting to specific environments.
7.1.0.0.1.1	Living cells require energy to function.
7.1.0.0.1.2	The earliest prokaryotes supplied their energy needs   their metabolism   by taking in small molecules from their environment, breaking the chemical bonds of these molecules, and using the energy released from those chemical bonds to do cellular work.
7.1.0.0.1.3	Many modern prokaryotes still function this way, and they function very successfully.
7.1.0.0.1.4	But about 2.5 billion years ago, the emergence of photosynthesis changed the nature of life on Earth.
7.1.0.0.1.5	Figure 1.4  Photosynthetic Organisms Changed Earth   s Atmosphere (A) Photosynthesis transforms the energy of sunlight into a form of *chemical energy that can be used to do work such as the synthesis of large molecules.
7.1.0.0.1.6	These large molecules can then be used to build cell structures or can be broken down to provide metabolic energy.
7.1.0.0.1.7	Photosynthesis is the basis of much of life on Earth today because its energy-capturing processes provide food for other organisms.
7.1.0.0.1.8	Early photosynthetic cells were probably similar to present-day prokaryotes called cyanobacteria (Figure 1.4).
7.1.0.0.1.9	Over time, photosynthetic prokaryotes became so abundant that vast quantities of oxygen gas (O2), which is a by-product of photosynthesis, began to accumulate in the atmosphere.
7.1.0.0.2.1	*connect the concepts The pathways that harvest chemical energy to do all the kinds of biological work necessary to support metabolism are presented in Chapter 9.
7.1.0.0.2.2	During the early history of prokaryotic life, there was no O2 in Earth   s atmosphere.
7.1.0.0.2.3	In fact, O2 was toxic to many of the prokaryotes living at that time, and its buildup in the atmosphere resulted in a huge mass extinction.
7.1.0.0.2.4	But those organisms that could tolerate O2 proliferated.
7.1.0.0.2.5	Atmospheric O2 opened up vast new avenues of evolution because aerobic metabolism   a biochemical process that uses O2 to extract energy from nutrient molecules   is far more efficient than anaerobic metabolism (which does not use O2).
7.1.0.0.2.6	Most organisms today use aerobic metabolism.
7.1.0.0.2.7	Oxygen in the atmosphere also made it possible for life to move onto land.
7.1.0.0.2.8	For most of life   s history, UV radiation falling on Earth   s surface was so intense that it destroyed any organism that was not shielded by water.
7.1.0.0.2.9	The atmospheric accumulation of photosynthetically generated O2 over a period of more than 2 billion years gradually produced a thick layer of ozone (O3) in the upper atmosphere.
7.1.0.0.2.10	By about 500 million years ago, the ozone layer was sufficiently dense and absorbed enough of the sun   s UV radiation to make it possible for organisms to leave the protection of the water and live on land.
7.1.0.0.1.1	Figure 1.5 Genetics Developed as the Study of Discrete Heritable Traits Figure 1.6 DNA Is Life   s Blueprint Before there was a science of biology, humans recognized that offspring resemble parents, and this fact was used by plant and animal breeders to produce variants with desirable qualities.
7.1.0.0.1.2	However, not until the famous plant breeding experiments of the Austrian monk Gregor Mendel in the mid-1800s was it demonstrated that inherited traits existed in discrete units (Figure 1.5).
7.1.0.0.1.3	These discrete units of inheritance were termed genes in the early 1900s, giving rise to the science of genetics.
7.1.0.0.1.4	An enormous body of information about traits of organisms represented by single genes was created before the chemical structure of a gene was known, and hence before the nature of the information that is passed from parent to offspring was known.
7.1.0.0.1.5	That mystery was solved in the mid-1900s with the discovery that the molecule deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA, is the genetic information that specifies what an organism will look like and how it will function.
7.1.0.0.1.6	This    blueprint  ? for the existence of each individual organism is contained in the sum total of all the DNA molecules contained in each of the organism   s cells   its genome.
7.1.0.0.1.7	DNA molecules are long sequences of four different subunits called nucleotides.
7.1.0.0.1.8	Genes are specific segments of DNA that encode the information the cell uses to build proteins.
7.1.0.0.1.9	Therefore each gene is defined by a specific sequence of the four nucleotides.
7.1.0.0.1.10	The genetic code spells out how sequences of nucleotides are *translated into sequences of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins.
7.1.0.0.1.11	This translation process involves first transcribing some of the DNA information of a gene into the structure of another smaller molecule called ribonucleic acid (RNA) (Figure 1.6).
7.1.0.0.1.12	RNA serves as the template for synthesis of a protein.
7.1.0.0.1.13	Protein molecules govern the chemical reactions within cells and form much of an organism   s structure.
7.1.0.0.2.1	*connect the concepts How the structure of DNA codes for and is translated into proteins is discussed in Concept 4.1 and in more detail in Chapters 13 and 14.
7.1.0.0.2.2	By analogy with a book, the nucleotides of DNA are like the letters of an alphabet, and protein molecules are the words.
7.1.0.0.2.3	Combinations of proteins that form structures and control specific biochemical processes are the sentences and paragraphs.
7.1.0.0.2.4	The structures and processes that are organized into different complex systems with specific tasks (such as digestion or movement) are the chapters of the book, and the complete book is the organism.
7.1.0.0.2.5	If you were to write out your own genome using four letters to represent the four nucleotides, you would write more than 3 billion letters.
7.1.0.0.2.6	Using the size type you are reading now, your genome would fill about 1,000 books the size of this one.
7.1.0.0.2.7	The processes of evolution are the authors and editors of all the books in the library of life.
7.1.0.0.2.8	Even though all the cells of a multicellular organism contain essentially the same genome, different cells of the organism have different functions and form different structures   contractile proteins form in muscle cells, hemoglobin in red blood cells, digestive enzymes in gut cells, and so on.
7.1.0.0.2.9	We thus surmise that different types of cells in an organism express different parts of the genome.
7.1.0.0.2.10	How cells control gene expression to enable a complex organism to develop and function is a major focus of current biological research.
7.1.0.0.2.11	The genome of an organism consists of thousands of genes.
7.1.0.0.2.12	This entire genome must be replicated as new cells are produced.
7.1.0.0.2.13	However, the replication process is not perfect, and a few errors, known as mutations, are likely to occur when the genome is replicated.
7.1.0.0.2.14	Mutations occur spontaneously and can be induced by environmental factors such as chemicals and radiation.
7.1.0.0.2.15	Most mutations are either harmful or have no effect, but occasionally a mutation improves the functioning of the organism under the environmental conditions it encounters.
7.1.0.0.2.16	The discovery of the structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in the middle of the twentieth century, and the subsequent elucidation of the mechanisms by which this material encodes and transmits information, transformed biology.
7.1.0.0.2.17	These crucial discoveries are detailed in Parts Four and Five of this book.
7.1.0.0.1.1	A population is a group of individuals of the same type of organism that interbreed.
7.1.0.0.1.2	The processes of evolution result in changes in the genetic makeup of populations through time.
7.1.0.0.1.3	Evolution is the major unifying principle of biology.
7.1.0.0.1.4	Charles Darwin compiled factual evidence for evolution in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species.
7.1.0.0.1.5	Darwin argued that differential survival and reproduction among individuals in a population, which he termed *natural selection, could account for much of the evolution of biodiversity.
7.1.0.0.2.1	*connect the concepts The story of Darwin   s formulation of evolution by natural selection is covered in Key Concept 20.1.
7.1.0.0.2.2	Although Darwin proposed that all organisms are descended from a common ancestor and therefore are related to one another, he did not have knowledge of the mechanisms of genetic inheritance.
7.1.0.0.2.3	Even so, he understood the process of selective breeding of plants and animals to obtain breeds with desired traits.
7.1.0.0.2.4	Darwin himself was a pigeon breeder and knew that he could produce pigeons with different colorations, feather patterns, or tail shapes by selecting mates (see Figure 20.5).
7.1.0.0.2.5	The steps in such selective breeding can be described as follows:
7.1.0.0.3.1	Observe trait variation in a population.
7.1.0.0.4.1	Selectively breed pairs based on a desired trait to produce that trait in their offspring.
7.1.0.0.5.1	Repeat such crosses in subsequent generations to amplify the trait.
7.1.0.0.5.2	Darwin realized that if humans could select for specific traits in domesticated plants and animals, the same process could operate in nature; hence the term    natural selection  ? as opposed to artificial (human-imposed) selection.
7.1.0.0.5.3	He reasoned that the reproductive capacity of plants and animals, if unchecked, would result in unlimited growth of populations, but we do not observe such growth in nature.
7.1.0.0.5.4	In most species, only a small percentage of an individual   s offspring survive to reproduce.
7.1.0.0.5.5	Thus any trait that confers even a small increase in the probability that its possessor will survive and reproduce increases in the population across generations.
7.1.0.0.5.6	Figure 1.7 Adaptations to the Environment Because organisms with certain traits survive and reproduce best under specific sets of conditions, natural selection leads to adaptations: structural, physiological, or behavioral traits that enhance an organism   s chances of survival and reproduction in its environment (Figure 1.7).
7.1.0.0.5.7	The opening story of this chapter described experiments aimed at understanding adaptations that might enable corals to survive in a warmer environment.
7.1.0.0.5.8	In addition to natural selection, evolutionary processes such as sexual selection (selection due to mate choice) and genetic drift (the random fluctuation of gene frequencies in a population due to chance events) contribute to biodiversity.
7.1.0.0.5.9	These processes operating over evolutionary history have contributed to the remarkable diversity of life on Earth.
7.1.0.0.5.10	Part Six describes how natural selection and other evolutionary processes are supported and explained by the massive body of genetic and molecular genetic knowledge mostly produced over the past hundred years.
7.1.0.0.5.11	Figure 1.8 The Blueprint of Life Over most of the history of biology, the diversity of life was described and catalogued based on structural characteristics of organisms.
7.1.0.0.5.12	With the rapid development of molecular genetic tools in recent years, it is now possible to obtain the DNA sequences of parts or all of the genomes of organisms.
7.1.0.0.5.13	Now it is possible to compare organisms on the basis of their DNA blueprints, which has given rise to the field of genomics.
7.1.0.0.5.14	For example, a structural feature that differentiates humans with African or European origins versus East Asian origins is hair.
7.1.0.0.5.15	Europeans have fine hair that can be curly, as is the hair of Africans.
7.1.0.0.5.16	East Asians have thick hair that is straight.
7.1.0.0.5.17	This difference is due to a gene called EDAR and to a single nucleotide substitution in that gene resulting in a single amino acid change in the protein product of that gene (Figure 1.8).
7.1.0.0.5.18	The ability to sequence the billions of letters in genetic codes generates enormous amounts of data, and to manage and analyze that data, the field of bioinformatics has grown in parallel with genomics.
7.1.0.0.5.19	Genomics has enormous applications throughout biology, from evolutionary studies to investigations of human health.
7.1.0.0.5.20	Advances in genomics and bioinformatics make current initiatives in precision medicine possible.
7.1.0.0.1.1	Populations geographically isolated from one another evolve differences.
7.1.0.0.1.2	As populations diverge from one another, individuals from one population become less likely to reproduce successfully with individuals of the other populations.
7.1.0.0.1.3	Eventually these differences between the populations become so great that they are considered to be different species.
7.1.0.0.1.4	Thus species that share a fairly recent evolutionary history are generally more similar to each other than are species that share an ancestor in the more distant past.
7.1.0.0.1.5	By identifying, analyzing, and quantifying similarities and differences among species, biologists can construct phylogenetic trees that portray the evolutionary histories of the different groups of organisms.
7.1.0.0.1.6	As an example, we can show the evolutionary relationships among humans and our closest living relatives in a branching diagram that shows how they diverged from a common ancestor.
7.1.0.0.1.7	In this tree, the living species are shown at the tips of the branches, and the branches show when these groups diverged from one another along a time scale.
7.1.0.0.1.8	Our convention in this book will be to place phylogenetic trees on their sides, with the oldest lineages on the left and the most recent to the right.
7.1.0.0.2.1	Tens of millions of species exist on Earth today; many times that number lived in the past but are now extinct.
7.1.0.0.2.2	Biologists give each of these species a distinctive scientific name formed from two Latinized names   a binomial.
7.1.0.0.2.3	The first part of the name identifies the species    genus (plural genera)   a group of species that share a recent common ancestor.
7.1.0.0.2.4	The second part of the scientific name identifies a particular species within the genus.
7.1.0.0.2.5	For example, the scientific name for modern-day humans is Homo sapiens: Homo is our genus, sapiens refers to our species.
7.1.0.0.2.6	Homo is Latin for    man,  ? and sapiens is from the Latin word for    wise  ? or    rational.  ?
7.1.0.0.2.7	The binomial for our close but extinct relatives, the Neanderthals, is Homo neanderthalensis.
7.1.0.0.2.8	Note that it is conventional to write the binomial in italics with the genus capitalized but the second part not capitalized.
7.1.0.0.3.1	Figure 1.9 The Tree of Life The earliest division of life was between the Bacteria and Archaea.
7.1.0.0.3.2	Later, one lineage of Archaea incorporated specializations (including a cell nucleus) that allowed the repeated evolution of multicellularity; we call this specialized group Eukarya.
7.1.0.0.3.3	The aqua branches within Eukarya represent various groups of microbial eukaryotes, more commonly known as    protists.  ?
7.1.0.0.3.4	The organisms on any one branch share a common ancestor.
7.1.0.0.4.1	Q: According to this phylogenetic tree, are fungi more closely related to plants or to animals?
7.1.0.0.4.2	Much of biology is based on comparisons among species.
7.1.0.0.4.3	Meaningful interpretations of those comparisons require an understanding of evolutionary relationships of the respective species.
7.1.0.0.4.4	Our ability to reconstruct evolutionary relationships has been greatly enhanced in recent decades by gene sequencing.
7.1.0.0.4.5	Genomic sequence analysis and other molecular techniques have enabled biologists to augment evolutionary knowledge based on the fossil record with a vast array of molecular evidence.
7.1.0.0.4.6	The result is the ongoing compilation of phylogenetic trees that document and diagram evolutionary relationships.
7.1.0.0.4.7	The broadest categories of the tree of life are shown in Figure 1.9, and they will be surveyed in more detail in Part Seven.
7.1.0.0.4.8	(The tree is expanded in Appendix A, and you can also explore the tree interactively online. )
7.1.0.0.4.9	Although many details remain to be clarified, the broad outlines of the tree of life have been determined.
7.1.0.0.4.10	Its branching patterns are based on a rich array of evidence from fossils, structures, metabolic processes, behavior, and molecular analyses of genomes.
7.1.0.0.4.11	Recall that the primary division of life   into Archaea and Bacteria   occurred among the early single-celled prokaryotes.
7.1.0.0.4.12	Members of these two groups differ so fundamentally that they are believed to have separated into distinct evolutionary lineages early in the history of life.
7.1.0.0.4.13	One of the lineages of Archaea incorporated a nucleus and internal, membrane-bound organelles and gave rise to the major group Eukarya.
7.1.0.0.4.14	Plants, fungi, and animals are examples of familiar multicellular eukaryotes that evolved independently, from different groups of the unicellular eukaryotes known as protists.
7.1.0.0.4.15	We know that plants, fungi, and animals had independent origins of multicellularity because each of these three groups is most closely related to different groups of protists, as can be seen from the branching pattern of Figure 1.9.
7.1.0.0.1.1	Single-celled organisms must provide for all of their own needs, but the cells of multicellular organisms can evolve specializations to carry out certain functions exclusively and efficiently because they can depend on other cells to carry out other functions.
7.1.0.0.1.2	Thus the cells of a multicellular organism can have different developmental fates.
7.1.0.0.1.3	Similar cell types can develop together into tissues that accomplish tasks that a single cell cannot.
7.1.0.0.1.4	For example, muscle cells develop cellular mechanisms for generating force.
7.1.0.0.1.5	A single muscle cell cannot generate much force, but many cells of a muscle tissue can work together to generate considerable force, and working with structural tissues such as bones, they can produce large movements.
7.1.0.0.1.6	Different tissue types develop together into organs that accomplish specific functions.
7.1.0.0.1.7	The heart, brain, and stomach are each composed of several types of tissues, as are the roots, stems, and leaves of plants.
7.1.0.0.1.8	Organs whose functions are interrelated can be grouped into organ systems; the esophagus, stomach, and intestines, for example, are all part of the digestive system.
7.1.0.0.1.9	The hierarchy of biological organization from atom to organism is shown in Figure 1.10A.
7.1.0.0.1.10	The biology of the two major groups of multicellular organisms, plants and animals, is discussed in detail in Parts Eight and Nine, respectively.
7.1.0.0.2.1	Figure 1.10 Biology Is Studied at Many Levels of Organization (A)  Life   s properties emerge when DNA and other molecules are organized in cells, which form building blocks for organisms.
7.1.0.0.2.2	(B) Organisms exist in populations and interact with other populations to form communities, which interact with the physical environment to make up the many ecosystems of the biosphere.
7.1.0.0.1.1	Living organisms acquire nutrients from the environment.
7.1.0.0.1.2	Biochemical reactions break down complex nutrient molecules into smaller chemical units.
7.1.0.0.1.3	Some of those smaller units are used as building blocks for structures the organism requires.
7.1.0.0.1.4	The breakdown of nutrient molecules does more than supply raw materials.
7.1.0.0.1.5	The breaking of the chemical bonds of nutrient molecules releases energy that the cell transfers to high-energy molecules that it uses to do work.
7.1.0.0.1.6	Figure 1.11 Energy Can Be Used Immediately or Stored (A) One kind of work cells do is mechanical   moving molecules from one cellular location to another, moving whole cells or tissues, or even moving the organism itself (Figure 1.11A).
7.1.0.0.1.7	The cell also does biochemical work in the building, or synthesis, of new complex molecules and structures from smaller chemical units.
7.1.0.0.1.8	For example, we are all familiar with the fact that carbohydrates eaten today may be deposited in the body as fat tomorrow (Figure 1.11B).
7.1.0.0.1.9	Still another kind of work is the electrical work that is the essence of information processing in nervous systems.
7.1.0.0.1.10	The many biochemical reactions that take place in cells are integrally linked in that the products of one reaction are the raw materials of the next.
7.1.0.0.1.11	These complex networks of reactions must be integrated and precisely controlled; when they are not, the result is malfunction and disease.
7.1.0.0.1.1	If different specialized cells, tissues, and organs provide for different needs of the multicellular organism, how are these specific services shared by the cells of the whole organism?
7.1.0.0.1.2	All of the cells of the body share an internal environment that is made up of extracellular fluids.
7.1.0.0.1.3	Cells derive their nutrients from these extracellular fluids, and they deposit their wastes into the extracellular fluid.
7.1.0.0.1.4	This internal environment serves the needs of all cells of the body, and therefore its physical and chemical composition must be maintained within a narrow range of physiological conditions that support survival and function.
7.1.0.0.1.5	The maintenance of this narrow range of conditions is known as homeostasis.
7.1.0.0.1.6	A relatively stable internal environment means that cells can function efficiently even when external conditions could not support the lives of individual cells. *Homeostasis requires that the activities of the cells and systems of the body be regulated.
7.1.0.0.1.7	Regulation requires information   information about internal conditions, external conditions, and what is optimal.
7.1.0.0.1.8	Thus organisms must have sensory mechanisms to monitor conditions, effector mechanisms to alter those conditions, and signaling mechanisms to integrate information and enable communication between sensors and effectors.
7.1.0.0.1.9	The major informational systems of animals   nervous, hormonal, and immune   use chemical and electrical signals to process information.
7.1.0.0.2.1	*connect the concepts The regulation of body temperature is an important example of homeostasis that is discussed in Chapter 40.
7.1.0.0.2.2	The concept of homeostasis also applies to the intracellular environment.
7.1.0.0.2.3	Both unicellular and multicellular organisms must regulate the composition of their intracellular environments within a range that allows those cells to survive and function.
7.1.0.0.2.4	Individual cells regulate these properties through actions of their membranes and, in the case of eukaryotes, their organelles.
7.1.0.0.2.5	Thus self-regulation to maintain a more or less constant internal environment is a general attribute of all life.
7.1.0.0.1.1	Organisms do not live in isolation.
7.1.0.0.1.2	Besides the internal hierarchy of the individual organism, there is also an external hierarchy of the biological world (Figure 1.10B).
7.1.0.0.1.3	The populations of all the species that live and interact in a defined area are called a community.
7.1.0.0.1.4	Communities together with their abiotic, or physical, environment constitute an ecosystem.
7.1.0.0.1.5	Individuals in a population interact in many different ways.
7.1.0.0.1.6	Animals eat plants and other animals and compete with other species for food and other resources.
7.1.0.0.1.7	Some animals prevent other individuals of their own species from exploiting a resource, be it food, nesting sites, or mates.
7.1.0.0.1.8	Animals may also cooperate with members of their own species, forming social units such as a termite colony or a flock of birds.
7.1.0.0.1.9	Such interactions have resulted in the evolution of social behaviors such as communication and courtship displays.
7.1.0.0.1.10	Plants also interact with their external biotic and abiotic environment.
7.1.0.0.1.11	Plants living on land depend on partnerships with fungi, bacteria, and animals.
7.1.0.0.1.12	Some of these partnerships are necessary to obtain nutrients, some to produce fertile seeds, and still others to disperse seeds.
7.1.0.0.1.13	Plants compete with each other for light and water and have ongoing evolutionary interactions with the animals that eat them.
7.1.0.0.1.14	Through time, many adaptations such as thorns and toxins have evolved that protect plants from predation.
7.1.0.0.1.15	Other adaptations such as flowers and fruits help attract the animals that assist in plant reproduction.
7.1.0.0.1.16	The interactions of populations of plant and animal species in a community are major evolutionary forces that produce specialized adaptations.
7.1.0.0.1.17	The major ecosystems of Earth that cover broad geographic areas with distinguishing physical features and communities of organisms are known as biomes.
7.1.0.0.1.18	Examples of biomes include Arctic tundra, coral reefs, and tropical rainforests.
7.1.0.0.1.19	All of the biomes on our planet make up the biosphere.
7.1.0.0.1.20	The ways in which species interact with one another and with their environment in populations, communities, and ecosystems is the subject of ecology, covered in Part Ten of this book.
7.1.0.0.2.1	1.1 recap All organisms are related by common descent from a single origin of life.
7.1.0.0.2.2	They contain genetic information that encodes how they look and how they function.
7.1.0.0.2.3	They also reproduce, extract energy from their environment, use energy to do biological work, synthesize complex molecules to build biological structures, regulate their internal environment, and interact with one another.
7.1.0.0.2.4	Evolution has produced an enormous diversity of organisms that make up communities and ecosystems.
7.1.0.0.2.5	Genomics helps scientists establish the evolutionary relationships between organisms.

7.1.0.0.12.2	The preceding section outlined the major features of life   features that we will cover in depth in subsequent chapters of this book.
7.1.0.0.12.3	Before going into the details of what we know about life, however, it is important to understand how scientists obtain information and how they use that information to broaden our understanding of life and to put that understanding to practical use.
7.1.0.0.13.1	Chapter 1 continues with
7.1.0.0.14.1	1.2 Biologists Investigate Life through Experiments That Test Hypotheses
7.1.2.1.1	Observing and quantifying are important skills
7.1.2.2.1	Scientific methods combine observation, experimentation, and logic
7.1.2.3.1	Good experiments have the potential to falsify hypotheses
7.1.2.4.1	Statistical methods are essential scientific tools
7.1.2.5.1	Discoveries in biology can be generalized
7.1.2.6.1	Not all forms of inquiry are scientific
7.1.2.7.1	Scientific investigations are based on observation, experimentation, data analysis, and logic.
7.1.2.7.2	Scientists use many different tools and methods in making observations, collecting data, experimenting, analyzing data, and applying logic.
7.1.2.8.1	focus your learning
7.1.2.9.1	Scientific methods produce biological knowledge.
7.1.0.0.1.1	Biologists observe the world around them.
7.1.0.0.1.2	Our ability to observe has been greatly enhanced by technologies such as electron microscopes, rapid genome sequencing, magnetic resonance imaging, and global positioning satellites.
7.1.0.0.1.3	These technologies allow us to observe everything from the distribution of molecules in the body to the movement of animals across continents and oceans.
7.1.0.0.2.1	Observation is a basic tool of biology, but as scientists we must be able to quantify the information, or data, we collect and observe.
7.1.0.0.2.2	Whether we are testing a new drug or mapping the migrations of whales, it is essential to apply mathematical and statistical methods to the data we collect.
7.1.0.0.2.3	In our opening discussion of the responses of corals to temperature, it was essential for Rachael to measure temperatures accurately and to have a physical measure of bleaching so she could compare the responses of her corals to different conditions and conclude that the differences were more than just random variation.
7.1.0.0.1.1	Textbooks often describe    the scientific method,  ? as if there were a single, simple flow chart that all scientists follow.
7.1.0.0.1.2	This is an oversimplification.
7.1.0.0.1.3	Although flow charts such as the one shown in Figure 1.12 incorporate much of what scientists do, you should not conclude that scientists necessarily progress through the steps of the process in one prescribed, linear order.
7.1.0.0.1.4	Figure 1.12 Scientific Methodology
7.1.0.0.2.1	Observations lead to questions.
7.1.0.0.2.2	To answer those questions, scientists make additional observations, formulate possible answers, and do experiments to test those possibilities.
7.1.0.0.2.3	This investigative approach traditionally has five steps: (1) making observations; (2) asking questions; (3) forming hypotheses, which are tentative answers to the questions; (4) making predictions based on the hypotheses; and (5) testing the predictions by making additional observations or conducting experiments.
7.1.0.0.3.1	After posing a question, a scientist often uses inductive logic to propose a tentative answer.
7.1.0.0.3.2	Inductive logic involves taking observations or facts and formulating a new proposition that is compatible with those observations or facts.
7.1.0.0.3.3	Such a tentative proposition is a hypothesis (plural hypotheses).
7.1.0.0.3.4	For example, in the opener to this chapter, you learned that Rachael Bay observed corals growing in pools that reached temperatures known to kill corals.
7.1.0.0.3.5	She formulated two hypotheses:
7.1.0.0.4.1	The populations of corals in the warm pools have evolved genetic differences that enable them to survive heat stress (adaptations), or
7.1.0.0.5.1	Individual corals have the ability to adjust physiologically to different thermal conditions (acclimation).
7.1.0.0.6.1	Rachael and her colleagues conducted experiments and made observations to test these hypotheses.
7.1.0.0.6.2	How do scientists design experiments to test hypotheses?
7.1.0.0.7.1	The next step in the scientific method is to apply a different form of logic   deductive logic   that starts with a statement believed to be true (the hypothesis) and then goes on to predict what facts would also have to be true to be compatible with that statement.
7.1.0.0.7.2	Rachael   s team tested their hypotheses by measuring how corals from the warm and cool pools responded to laboratory experiments that simulated the heat-stress conditions that occurred sometimes in the warm pools.
7.1.0.0.7.3	They predicted that the cool-pool corals would bleach at higher rates under the experimental conditions than the warm-pool corals would.
7.1.0.0.7.4	That experiment revealed differences between the two populations, but did not reveal whether the differences were a result of long-term evolutionary changes in the populations (adaptations) or short-term acclimation of individuals to their current environments.
7.1.0.0.7.5	The researchers therefore looked for genetic differences in the corals living in the warm and cool pools (adaptations).
7.1.0.0.7.6	They also looked for differences in gene expression patterns when the corals were transplanted to different environments (acclimation).
7.1.0.0.7.7	Did the two populations have fundamental genetic differences, or did the environments they lived in stimulate different patterns of gene expression and therefore physiological acclimation?
7.1.0.0.1.1	Once predictions are made from a hypothesis, experiments can be designed to test those predictions.
7.1.0.0.1.2	The most informative experiments are those that have the ability to show that the prediction is wrong.
7.1.0.0.1.3	If the prediction is wrong, the hypothesis must be questioned, modified, or rejected.
7.1.0.0.2.1	There are two general types of experiments, both of which compare data from different groups or samples:
7.1.0.0.3.1	Controlled experiments manipulate one factor of interest while holding other variables constant as a means of testing the influence of the manipulated variable.
7.1.0.0.4.1	Comparative experiments compare data gathered from different populations that differ in multiple, unknown ways.
7.1.0.0.5.1	Rachael Bay and her colleagues conducted both types of experiments, to reveal genetic differences between the coral populations as well as their abilities to acclimate to different temperature environments.
7.1.0.0.6.1	In a controlled experiment, we predict on the basis of our hypothesis that some critical factor, or variable, has an effect on the phenomenon we are investigating.
7.1.0.0.6.2	We devise some method to manipulate only that variable in an    experimental  ? group and compare the resulting data with data from an unmanipulated    control  ? group.
7.1.0.0.6.3	If the predicted difference occurs, we then apply statistical tests to ascertain the probability that the manipulation caused the difference (as opposed to the difference being the result of random chance).
7.1.0.0.6.4	Investigating Life: Corals in Hot Water describes a controlled experiment examining the effect of pool of origin on the response of corals to heat stress done by Rachael Bay and other members of the Palumbi laboratory.
7.1.0.0.6.5	A good controlled experiment is not easy to design because biological variables are so interrelated that it is sometimes difficult to alter just one.
7.1.0.0.6.6	In this experiment, the controlled variable was whether the experimental corals came from the cool-pool or the warm-pool environment.
7.1.0.0.6.7	They were then subjected to the same thermal stresses and their responses measured as extent of bleaching.
7.1.0.0.6.8	The control groups were corals not exposed to the thermal stress protocol.
7.1.0.0.7.1	A comparative experiment starts with the prediction that there will be a difference between samples or groups based on the hypothesis.
7.1.0.0.7.2	Unlike in a controlled experiment, we cannot control all the variables in a comparative experiment; often we cannot even identify all the variables involved.
7.1.0.0.7.3	We are simply gathering and comparing data from different sample groups.
7.1.0.0.7.4	Rachael and her colleagues did a comparative experiment in addition to the controlled experiment shown in Investigating Life: Corals in Hot Water.
7.1.0.0.7.5	They analyzed and compared the genetic makeup of corals taken from the warm and cool pools.
7.1.0.0.1.1	Whether we do comparative or controlled experiments, we have to decide whether there is a real difference between the samples, individuals, groups, or populations in the study.
7.1.0.0.1.2	How do we decide whether a measured difference is enough to support or falsify a hypothesis?
7.1.0.0.1.3	In other words, how do we decide in an unbiased, objective way that the measured difference is significant?
7.1.0.0.2.1	Significance is measured with statistical methods.
7.1.0.0.2.2	Random variation is almost always present in any set of measurements.
7.1.0.0.2.3	Statistical tests calculate the probability that the differences observed in an experiment could be due to random variation.
7.1.0.0.2.4	The results of statistical tests are therefore probabilities.
7.1.0.0.2.5	A statistical test starts with a null hypothesis   the premise that observed differences are the result of random variation that arises from drawing two finite samples from the same population.
7.1.0.0.2.6	When quantified observations, or data, are collected, statistical methods are applied to those data to see if there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

7.1.0.0.6.3	Science 344: 895   898.
7.1.0.0.7.1	Rachael Bay and her colleagues did a controlled experiment by bringing corals from the warm and the cool tidal pools into the laboratory and then subjecting them to cycles of heat stress that simulated the conditions that sometimes occurred in the warm tidal pools.
7.1.0.0.7.2	The outcome measure was bleaching   the loss of photosynthetic symbionts (dinoflagellates) from the coral bodies.
7.1.0.0.8.1	HYPOTHESIS  Heat stress results in coral bleaching, but corals from warm pools are less subject to bleaching under heat stress than are corals from cool pools.
7.1.0.0.9.1	METHOD
7.1.0.0.10.1	Transplant corals from warm and cool pools into laboratory aquaria maintained at a safe temperature.
7.1.0.0.11.1	Subject experimental corals to heat stress (the experimental condition) by simulating the daily temperature cycle in the warm pools.
7.1.0.0.12.1	Measure coral bleaching (the dependent variable) as the ratio of chlorophyll (the photosynthetic pigment of the symbionts) in the corals exposed to heat stress versus in the controls in non-stressed conditions.
7.1.0.0.12.2	A ratio of less than 1.0 indicates higher bleaching in the heat-stressed corals than in the controls.
7.1.0.0.13.1	RESULTS Corals from both cool pools and warm pools exhibited higher bleaching under heat stress than controls did, but the cool-pool corals showed higher average levels of bleaching than the warm-pool corals did.
7.1.0.0.13.2	(You will calculate the statistical significance of this difference in the following work with the data exercise. )
7.1.0.0.14.1	CONCLUSION  The warm-pool corals showed lower effects of heat stress than the cool-pool corals did, although both populations showed increased bleaching under heat stress.
7.1.0.0.14.2	The difference in the populations could be explained either by genetic adaptation to heat stress in the populations of warm-pool corals or by physiological acclimatization of individuals exposed to warm-pool conditions, or by some combination of the two.
7.1.0.0.15.1	work with the data
7.1.0.0.16.1	The bar graph in the Results section of the experiment shows that both cool-pool corals and warm-pool corals showed increased levels of bleaching under heat stress, relative to controls.
7.1.0.0.16.2	It also shows that the cool-pool corals showed greater relative bleaching under heat stress than did the warm-pool corals.
7.1.0.0.16.3	But how do we know that these differences are greater than would be expected if the variation within and between samples represents nothing more than random variation?
7.1.0.0.16.4	Here we will use some simple tests to see if the differences measured are significant (unlikely due to random variation).
7.1.0.0.16.5	Average chlorophyll ratio Cool-pool corals Warm-pool corals 0.0 0 0 0.1 0 0 0.2 1 0 0.3 1 0 0.4 4 0 0.5 7 0 0.6 1 0 0.7 1 1 0.8 2 3 0.9 0 3 1.0 0 1
7.1.0.0.17.1	QUESTIONS
7.1.0.0.18.1	Prepare a bar graph based on these data.
7.1.0.0.18.2	Display the chlorophyll ratios on the x axis, and show the number of corals that exhibited each ratio on the y axis.
7.1.0.0.19.1	First, let   s consider if there is a significant effect of heat stress in each of the two groups.
7.1.0.0.19.2	At the outset we assume that there is no effect of heat stress in either group   this is called our null hypothesis (H0).
7.1.0.0.19.3	We use statistical tests to decide if we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is an effect of heat stress.
7.1.0.0.19.4	If the null hypothesis is true, then we would expect that any differences in chlorophyll levels between control and experimental populations are due to random variation, and so we would expect the chlorophyll ratios to be greater than 1.0 as often as they are less than 1.0.
7.1.0.0.19.5	In other words, the expected distribution of values &lt; 1 and &gt; 1 is like the expected distribution of heads and tails in a coin toss.
7.1.0.0.19.6	Let   s first consider the cool-pool corals.
7.1.0.0.19.7	There are 17 samples, and all 17 had chlorophyll ratios &lt; 1.0.
7.1.0.0.19.8	The probability of this happening at random is the same as getting 17 heads in 17 flips of a fair coin (by a    fair coin  ? we mean the probability of heads in one flip = 0.5).
7.1.0.0.19.9	Using this criterion, calculate the probability of the null hypothesis (H0: no effect of heat stress on bleaching) for each of the two populations.
7.1.0.0.20.1	Now let   s consider if there is a significant difference in the level of bleaching in the cool-pool versus the warm-pool corals.
7.1.0.0.20.2	Our null hypothesis in this case is that the levels of bleaching are the same in both groups.
7.1.0.0.20.3	If the null hypothesis is true, then we would expect (on average) the same distribution of chlorophyll ratios in the samples of both groups.
7.1.0.0.20.4	From the Results section in the experiment, we see that the average chlorophyll ratio observed in the cool-pool samples is 0.5, and the average chlorophyll ratio observed in the warm-pool samples is 0.85.
7.1.0.0.20.5	Would we expect a difference this great if the distributions of the two samples were drawn from the same underlying distribution of values?
7.1.0.0.20.6	To find out, write each of the 25 observed chlorophyll ratios (from both groups) on an index card.
7.1.0.0.20.7	Thoroughly mix and shuffle the cards to randomize their order, and then deal them into two groups of the same size as the cool-pool samples (17) and warm-pool samples (8).
7.1.0.0.20.8	Calculate the average ratios in these randomized samples.
7.1.0.0.20.9	Repeat this procedure or combine the results of your randomization test with those of other students in your class.
7.1.0.0.20.10	How often do you see a difference as great as the observed difference in the two samples (0.85   0.5, or a difference of 0.35)?
7.1.0.0.21.1	What do these results suggest about the possible response of coral populations in different environments to ocean warming?
7.1.0.0.22.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.1.0.0.23.1	More specifically, statistical methods tell us the probability of obtaining the same results by chance even if the null hypothesis were true.
7.1.0.0.23.2	We need to eliminate, insofar as possible, the chance that any differences showing up in the data are merely the result of random variation in the samples tested.
7.1.0.0.23.3	Scientists generally conclude that the differences they measure are significant if statistical tests show that the probability of error (that is, the probability that a difference as large as the one observed could be obtained by mere chance) is 5 percent or lower.
7.1.0.0.23.4	They often use more stringent criteria for rejecting the null hypothesis, however, depending on the consequences of accepting a wrong hypothesis.
7.1.0.0.23.5	Appendix B of this book offers a short primer on statistical methods to which you can refer as you analyze data that will be presented throughout the text.
7.1.0.0.1.1	All life is related by descent from a common ancestor, shares a genetic code, and consists of similar biochemical building blocks.
7.1.0.0.1.2	Therefore knowledge gained from investigations of one type of organism can, with thought and care, be generalized to other organisms.
7.1.0.0.1.3	Biologists use model systems for research, knowing that they can extend their findings from such systems to other organisms.
7.1.0.0.1.4	For example, our basic understanding of the chemical reactions in cells came from research on bacteria but is applicable to all cells, including those of humans.
7.1.0.0.1.5	Similarly, the biochemistry of photosynthesis   the process by which all green plants use sunlight to produce biological molecules   was worked out largely from experiments on Chlorella, a unicellular green alga.
7.1.0.0.1.6	Much of what we know about the genes that control plant development is the result of work on Arabidopsis thaliana, a relative of the mustard plant.
7.1.0.0.1.7	Knowledge about how animals, including humans, develop has come from work on sea urchins, frogs, chickens, roundworms, mice, and fruit flies.
7.1.0.0.1.8	Being able to generalize from model systems is a powerful tool in biology.
7.1.0.0.1.1	Science is a unique human endeavor that has certain standards of practice.
7.1.0.0.1.2	Other areas of scholarship share with science the practice of making observations and asking questions, but scientists are distinguished by what they do with their observations, how they frame their questions, and how they determine their answers.
7.1.0.0.1.3	Quantifiable data, subjected to appropriate statistical analysis, are critical in evaluating hypotheses.
7.1.0.0.1.4	The Investigating Life boxes and the Work with the Data exercises you will find throughout this book are intended to reinforce this way of thinking.
7.1.0.0.1.5	Scientific observation, hypothesis generation, and experimental testing constitute the most powerful approach humans have devised for learning about the world and how it works.
7.1.0.0.2.1	Scientific explanations for natural processes are objective and reliable because a hypothesis must be testable and a hypothesis must have the potential of being rejected by direct observations and experiments.
7.1.0.0.2.2	Scientists must clearly describe the methods they use to test hypotheses so that other scientists can repeat their results.
7.1.0.0.2.3	Not all experiments are repeated, but surprising or controversial results are always subjected to independent verification.
7.1.0.0.2.4	Scientists worldwide share this process of testing and rejecting hypotheses, contributing to a common body of scientific knowledge.
7.1.0.0.3.1	If you understand the methods of science, you can distinguish science from non-science.
7.1.0.0.3.2	Art, music, and literature all contribute to the quality of human life, but they are not science.
7.1.0.0.3.3	They do not use scientific methods to establish what is fact.
7.1.0.0.3.4	Religion is not science, although religions have historically attempted to explain natural events ranging from unusual weather patterns to crop failures to human diseases.
7.1.0.0.3.5	Most such phenomena that at one time were mysterious can now be explained in terms of scientific principles.
7.1.0.0.3.6	Fundamental tenets of religious faith, such as the existence of a supreme deity or deities, cannot be confirmed or refuted by experimentation and are thus outside the realm of science.
7.1.0.0.4.1	The power of science derives from strict objectivity and absolute dependence on evidence based on reproducible and quantifiable observations.
7.1.0.0.4.2	A religious or spiritual explanation of a natural phenomenon may be coherent and satisfying for the person holding that view, but it is not testable and therefore it is not science.
7.1.0.0.4.3	To invoke a supernatural explanation (such as a    creator  ? or    intelligent designer  ? with no known bounds) is to depart from the world of science.
7.1.0.0.4.4	Science does not necessarily say that religious beliefs are wrong; they are simply not part of the world of science and are untestable using scientific methods.
7.1.0.0.5.1	Science describes how the world works.
7.1.0.0.5.2	It is silent on the question of how the world    ought to be.  ?
7.1.0.0.5.3	Many scientific advances that contribute to human welfare also raise major ethical issues.
7.1.0.0.5.4	Recent developments in genetics and developmental biology may enable us to select the sex of our children, to use stem cells to repair our bodies, and to modify the human genome.
7.1.0.0.5.5	Although scientific knowledge may enable us to do these things, science cannot tell us whether or not we should do so, or if we choose to do them, how we should regulate them.
7.1.0.0.5.6	Such issues are as crucial to human society as the science itself, and a responsible scientist does not lose sight of these questions or neglect the contributions of the humanities and social sciences in attempting to come to grips with them.
7.1.0.0.6.1	1.2 recap
7.1.0.0.7.1	Scientific methods of inquiry start with the formulation of hypotheses based on observations and data.
7.1.0.0.7.2	Comparative and controlled experiments are carried out to test hypotheses.
7.1.0.0.7.3	Statistics are essential for drawing conclusions from the data obtained in experiments.
7.1.0.0.7.4	Because organisms can be compared through their evolutionary relationships, the results of experiments can frequently be generalized to apply to other species.

7.1.0.0.9.1	You should be able to:
7.1.0.0.10.1	Explain the roles of inductive logic and deductive logic in scientific inquiry.
7.1.0.0.11.1	Describe how a controlled experiment is designed.
7.1.0.0.12.1	Differentiate between controlled experiments and comparative experiments.
7.1.0.0.13.1	Explain why model organisms are used in biological research.
7.1.0.0.14.1	What is the relationship between a hypothesis and an experiment?

7.1.0.0.16.1	What features characterize questions that can be answered using a comparative approach rather than through a controlled experiment?
7.1.0.0.17.1	Why is it often possible to generalize the results of biological research on one species to very different species?
7.1.0.0.18.1	The vast body of scientific knowledge accumulated over centuries of human civilization allows us to understand and manipulate aspects of the natural world in ways that no other species can.
7.1.0.0.18.2	These abilities present us with challenges, opportunities, and above all, responsibilities.

7.1.0.0.20.1	1.3 Understanding Biology Is Important for Health, Well-Being, and Public-Policy Decisions
7.1.3.1.1	Modern agriculture depends on biology
7.1.3.2.1	Biology is the basis of medical practice
7.1.3.3.1	Biology can inform public policy
7.1.3.4.1	Biology is crucial for understanding ecosystems
7.1.3.5.1	Biodiversity helps us understand, enjoy, and appreciate our world
7.1.3.6.1	Human beings exist in and depend on a world of living organisms.
7.1.3.6.2	The oxygen we breathe is produced by the photosynthetic activity of countless billions of individual organisms.
7.1.3.6.3	The food that fuels our bodies comes from the tissues of other living organisms.
7.1.3.6.4	The fuels that power our cars, trucks, and planes are carbon molecules produced by living organisms   mostly millions of years ago.
7.1.3.6.5	Inside and out, our bodies are covered in complex communities of living unicellular organisms.
7.1.3.6.6	Some help us be healthy, but others can invade our bodies and cause mild to serious diseases, or even death.
7.1.3.6.7	These interactions with other species are not limited to humans.
7.1.3.6.8	Ecosystems depend on thousands of complex interactions among the millions of species that inhabit Earth.
7.1.3.6.9	Understanding biological principles is essential for us to lead healthy productive lives and to be good stewards of our planet.
7.1.3.7.1	focus your learning
7.1.3.8.1	Biology contributes many things to society.
7.1.0.0.1.1	Agriculture represents some of the earliest human applications of biological principles.
7.1.0.0.1.2	Beginning about 10,000 years ago, humans began to cultivate and harvest grains.
7.1.0.0.1.3	It is probable that even in those early times farmers selected the most productive or otherwise favorable plants and animals to use as seed stock for propagation, and over generations farmers continued and refined these practices.
7.1.0.0.1.4	By 1960, the worldwide yield of food grains reached a billion tons, but human population growth outpaced agricultural productivity and starvation was common in developing countries.
7.1.0.0.1.5	Catastrophic famine was predicted for the 1970s.
7.1.0.0.1.6	In response to those predictions, developed countries initiated huge efforts to produce genetically improved, higher-yielding food grain varieties.
7.1.0.0.1.7	These highly successful research programs resulted in what has been called the Green Revolution, and by the year 2000 the worldwide yield of food grains, which make up about 50 percent of the calories in the human diet, reached 2 billion tons.
7.1.0.0.1.8	Increasing knowledge of plant and animal biology has transformed agriculture in many ways and has resulted in huge boosts in food production.
7.1.0.0.1.9	Figure 1.13 A Green Revolution
7.1.0.0.2.1	A new threat to agriculture and the world food supply is global climate change.
7.1.0.0.2.2	Some regions are becoming wetter and others drier, and those changes affect traditional agricultures.
7.1.0.0.2.3	An example is rice, which normally grows in shallow water in rice paddies (Figure 1.13).
7.1.0.0.2.4	But, common rice varieties cannot survive complete submergence for more than a few days, and are therefore killed by flooding caused by too much rain.
7.1.0.0.2.5	In India and Bangladesh alone, annual flooding can destroy about 4 million tons of rice, enough to feed 30 million people.
7.1.0.0.2.6	In recent years plant geneticists Pam Ronald, David Mackill, and their colleagues at the University of California at Davis have discovered a single gene from an ancient variety of rice that when genetically engineered into the current rice varieties makes them capable of surviving total submergence for many days.
7.1.0.0.2.7	Advances such as this may help save the benefits of the Green Revolution from the new problems generated by global climate change.
7.1.0.0.3.1	Over the past few decades, detailed knowledge of the genomes of many domestic species and the development of technology for directly recombining genes have allowed biologists to develop new breeds and strains of animals, plants, and fungi of agricultural interest.
7.1.0.0.3.2	New strains of crop plants are being developed that are resistant to pests or tolerant of drought or, in the case of rice, flooding.
7.1.0.0.3.3	Moreover, understanding evolutionary theory allows biologists to devise strategies for the application of pesticides that minimize the evolution of pest resistance.
7.1.0.0.3.4	And better understanding of plant   fungus relationships results in better plant health and higher productivity.
7.1.0.0.3.5	These are just a few of the many ways that biology continues to inform and improve agricultural practice.
7.1.0.0.1.1	People have speculated about the causes of diseases and searched for methods to combat them since ancient times.
7.1.0.0.1.2	Long before the microbial causes of many diseases were known, people recognized that infections could be passed from one person to another, and the isolation of infected persons has been practiced as long as written records have been available.
7.1.0.0.2.1	Modern biological research informs us about how living organisms work, and about why they develop the problems and infections that we call disease.
7.1.0.0.2.2	In addition to diseases caused by infectious organisms, we now know that many diseases are genetic   meaning that variants of genes in our genomes cause particular problems in the way we function.
7.1.0.0.2.3	Developing appropriate treatments or cures for diseases depends on understanding the origin, basis, and effects of these diseases, as well as understanding the consequences of any changes we make.
7.1.0.0.2.4	For example, the recent resurgence of tuberculosis is the result of the evolution of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics.
7.1.0.0.2.5	Dealing with future tuberculosis epidemics will require understanding aspects of molecular biology, physiology, microbial ecology, and evolution   in other words, many of the general principles of modern biology.
7.1.0.0.2.6	Figure 1.14 Medical Applications of Biology Improve Human Health
7.1.0.0.3.1	Many of the microbial organisms that are periodically epidemic in human populations have short generation times and high mutation rates.
7.1.0.0.3.2	For example, we need yearly vaccines for flu because of the high rate of evolution of influenza viruses, the causative agent of flu.
7.1.0.0.3.3	Evolutionary principles help us understand how influenza viruses are changing, and can even help us predict which strains of influenza virus are likely to lead to future flu epidemics.
7.1.0.0.3.4	This medical understanding   which combines an application of molecular biology, evolutionary theory, and basic principles of ecology   allows medical researchers to develop effective vaccines and other strategies for the control of major epidemics (Figure 1.14).
7.1.0.0.1.1	Thanks to the deciphering of genomes and our newfound ability to manipulate them, vast new possibilities now exist for controlling human diseases and increasing agricultural productivity   but these capabilities raise ethical and policy issues.
7.1.0.0.1.2	How much and in what ways should we tinker with the genes of humans and other species?
7.1.0.0.1.3	Does it matter whether the genomes of our crop plants and domesticated animals are changed by traditional methods of controlled breeding or by the biotechnology of gene transfer?
7.1.0.0.1.4	What rules should govern the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment?
7.1.0.0.1.5	Science alone cannot provide all the answers, but wise policy decisions must be based on accurate scientific information.
7.1.0.0.2.1	Figure 1.15 Bluefin Tuna Do Not Recognize Boundaries (A)
7.1.0.0.3.1	Marine biologist Barbara Block attaches computerized data-recording tracking tags to a live bluefin tuna before returning it to the Atlantic Ocean, where its travels will be monitored.
7.1.0.0.3.2	(B) Tracking data from eastern (Mediterranean) and western (Gulf of Mexico) breeding populations of bluefin tuna.
7.1.0.0.3.3	At one time commercial fishing regulatory agencies assumed that bluefins from western- and eastern-breeding populations fed on their respective sides of the Atlantic.
7.1.0.0.3.4	To speed recovery of the endangered western population, fishing quotas were created for each side of the mid-Atlantic Ocean (dashed line).
7.1.0.0.4.1	Q: Based on Dr. Block   s data, does it seem likely that fishing quotas based on the mid-Atlantic boundary line would protect the western-breeding population of bluefin tuna?
7.1.0.0.5.1	Biologists are increasingly called on to advise government agencies concerning the laws, rules, and regulations by which society deals with the increasing number of challenges that have a biological basis.
7.1.0.0.5.2	As an example of the value of scientific knowledge for the assessment and formulation of public policy, consider a management problem.
7.1.0.0.5.3	Scientists and fishermen have long known that Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) have a western breeding ground in the Gulf of Mexico and an eastern breeding ground in the Mediterranean Sea (Figure 1.15).
7.1.0.0.5.4	Overfishing led to declining numbers of bluefin tuna, especially in the western-breeding populations, to the point of these populations being endangered.
7.1.0.0.6.1	Initially it was assumed by scientists, fishermen, and policy makers alike that the eastern and western populations had geographically separate feeding grounds as well as separate breeding grounds.
7.1.0.0.6.2	Acting on this assumption, an international commission drew a line down the middle of the Atlantic Ocean and established strict fishing quotas on the western side of the line, with the intent of allowing the western population to recover.
7.1.0.0.6.3	Modern tracking data, however, revealed that in fact the eastern and western bluefin populations mix freely on their feeding grounds across the entire North Atlantic   a swath of ocean that includes the most heavily fished waters in the world.
7.1.0.0.6.4	Tuna caught on the eastern side of the line could just as likely be from the western-breeding population as the eastern; thus the established policy could not achieve its intended goal.
7.1.0.0.7.1	Scientific knowledge can make significant contributions to the formulation of wise public policy, but economic and political factors frequently outweigh scientific recommendations.
7.1.0.0.7.2	It is particularly lamentable when solid scientific evidence is discounted or ignored because it is inconvenient.
7.1.0.0.7.3	An example is the rejection by many policy makers of strong evidence for and scientific consensus on global climate change.
7.1.0.0.1.1	Figure 1.16 A Warmer World
7.1.0.0.2.1	Earth has been changing since its formation and continues to change.
7.1.0.0.2.2	Human activity, however, is resulting in an unprecedented rate of change in the world   s ecosystems.
7.1.0.0.2.3	For example, the mining and consumption of fossil fuels is releasing massive quantities of carbon dioxide into Earth   s atmosphere.
7.1.0.0.2.4	This anthropogenic (human-generated) increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide is largely responsible for the rapid rate of global climate warming recorded over the last 50 years (Figure 1.16).
7.1.0.0.3.1	Our use of natural resources is putting stress on the ability of Earth   s ecosystems to continue to produce the goods and services on which our society depends.
7.1.0.0.3.2	Human activities are changing global climates at an unprecedented rate and are leading to the extinctions of large numbers of species (such as the reef-building corals featured in this chapter).
7.1.0.0.3.3	The modern, warmer world is also experiencing the spread of new diseases and the resurgence of old ones.
7.1.0.0.3.4	Biological knowledge is vital for determining the causes of these changes and for devising policies to deal with them.
7.1.0.0.1.1	Figure 1.17 Exploring Life on Earth
7.1.0.0.2.1	Beyond issues of policy and pragmatism lies the human    need to know.  ?
7.1.0.0.2.2	Most people are fascinated by the richness and diversity of life and want to know more about organisms, how they function, and how they interact (Figure 1.17).
7.1.0.0.2.3	For the biologist, biodiversity offers an inexhaustible source of new questions and opportunities for new investigations and experiments.
7.1.0.0.2.4	New discoveries and greater knowledge generate questions no one thought to ask before.
7.1.0.0.2.5	Science is a never-ending quest.
7.1.0.0.3.1	Apart from scientific endeavors, biodiversity enriches our lives.
7.1.0.0.3.2	You may be an avid birdwatcher, or enjoy gardening, or seek out particular species if you hunt or fish.
7.1.0.0.3.3	Some people observe or collect butterflies, or mushrooms, or other groups of plants and animals.
7.1.0.0.3.4	Displays of spring wildflowers bring out throngs of human viewers.
7.1.0.0.3.5	Hiking and camping in natural areas full of diverse species are activities enjoyed by millions.
7.1.0.0.3.6	Learning about biology greatly increases our enjoyment of the world around us.
7.1.0.0.4.1	investigatinglife
7.1.0.0.5.1	How might experiments on heat stress in corals be used to predict the response of corals to global warming?
7.1.0.0.6.1	How can we put studies like the one conducted by Rachael and her colleagues to use?
7.1.0.0.6.2	One way is to use the information to make predictions.
7.1.0.0.6.3	As we&#8217;ve noted in this chapter, abundant evidence shows that Earth&#8217;s climate is warming as a result of increased levels of CO2 in our atmosphere.
7.1.0.0.6.4	Can corals survive this global warming, or will they all lose their photosynthetic dinoflagellates and die?
7.1.0.0.6.5	The experiments and observations done by Rachael&#8217;s team suggest that higher temperatures will lead to increased coral bleaching, but that some short-term acclimation of individuals can occur.
7.1.0.0.6.6	If global warming is slowed sufficiently, longer-term processes of evolution will act on the surviving corals that have genetic adaptations that increase their tolerance to warmer waters.
7.1.0.0.6.7	This selection process should result in genetic changes in populations, which will allow more corals to survive.
7.1.0.0.6.8	How well acclimation and adaptation can work to ensure the survival of corals depends on many factors, including the average life span of individual corals, the rate of global warming, and the availability of alternative heat-resistant dinoflagellates.
7.1.0.0.6.9	The basic research conducted by Rachael&#8217;s team is a first, but critical, step in predicting the future response of corals to global warming.
7.1.0.0.7.1	Future directions
7.1.0.0.8.1	As described, the corals in Rachael&#8217;s study have certain species of dinoflagellates growing within their cells.
7.1.0.0.8.2	The corals provide a suitable environment for the dinoflagellates and the dinoflagellates provide nutrients for the corals.
7.1.0.0.8.3	Such a mutually beneficial relationship is called symbiosis.
7.1.0.0.8.4	The bleaching response to high temperature implies dysfunction in the dinoflagellates, leading to their expulsion from the corals.
7.1.0.0.8.5	Understanding thermal tolerance of the corals therefore requires greater understanding of genetic changes and acclimation of the symbiotic dinoflagellates.
7.1.0.0.8.6	Other studies have shown that some corals contain multiple strains of dinoflagellates, and these strains change in abundance when the corals are grown at different temperatures, perhaps contributing to thermal tolerance.
7.1.0.0.8.7	There are many species and strains of dinoflagellates, but coral species usually are associated with specific species.
7.1.0.0.8.8	Future research could focus on thermal tolerance of dinoflagellates to identify genes that confer thermal tolerance.
7.1.0.0.8.9	Additional research could be to find ways of transferring those genes into other species of dinoflagellates or to find ways of infecting corals endangered by rising temperatures with strains of temperature-tolerant symbionts.
7.1.0.0.9.1	1.3 recap
7.1.0.0.10.1	Biology informs us about the structure, processes, and interactions of the living organisms that make up our world.
7.1.0.0.10.2	Informed decisions about food and energy production, health, and our environment depend on biological knowledge.
7.1.0.0.10.3	Biology also addresses the human need to understand the world around us, and helps us appreciate the diverse planet we call home.

7.1.summary.1.1	1.1
7.1.summary.2.1	Living Organisms Share Similarities and a Common Origin
7.1.summary.3.1	Biology is the scientific study of organisms, including their characteristics, evolution, functions, and interactions.
7.1.summary.4.1	All living organisms are related to one another through common descent.
7.1.summary.4.2	Shared features among organisms support the concept of a common ancestry for all life on Earth.
7.1.summary.4.3	These features include: a common set of chemical building blocks, a nearly universal genetic code, sequence similarities across fundamental genes, and similarities in cellular structure and function.
7.1.summary.5.1	Cells evolved early in the history of life.
7.1.summary.5.2	Cellular specialization allowed multicellular organisms to increase in size and diversity.
7.1.summary.5.3	Review Figure 1.2
7.1.summary.6.1	Photosynthesis provided a means of capturing energy directly from sunlight, and over time changed Earth   s atmosphere.
7.1.summary.7.1	The instructions for a cell are contained in its genome, which consists of DNA molecules made up of sequences of nucleotides.
7.1.summary.7.2	Specific segments of DNA called genes contain the information the cell uses to make proteins through processes of transcription and translation.
7.1.summary.7.3	Review Figure 1.6.
7.1.summary.8.1	Evolution   change in the genetic makeup of biological populations through time   is a fundamental principle of life.
7.1.summary.8.2	Populations evolve by means of several different processes, including natural selection, which is responsible for the diversity of adaptations found in living organisms.
7.1.summary.9.1	Biologists use fossils, anatomical similarities and differences, and molecular comparisons of genomes to reconstruct the history of life.
7.1.summary.9.2	Life is divided into two major lineages   Bacteria, Archaea.
7.1.summary.9.3	One lineage of Archaea became specialized as Eukarya, which includes all multicellular organisms.
7.1.summary.9.4	Review Figure 1.9
7.1.summary.10.1	Life can be studied at different levels of organization within a biological hierarchy.
7.1.summary.10.2	The specialized cells of multicellular organisms are organized into tissues, organs, and organ systems.
7.1.summary.11.1	Living organisms, whether unicellular or multicellular, must regulate their internal environment to maintain homeostasis, the range of physical conditions necessary for their survival and function.
7.1.summary.12.1	Individual organisms form populations and interact with other organisms of their own and other species.
7.1.summary.12.2	The populations that live and interact in a defined area form a community, and communities together with their abiotic (nonliving) environment constitute an ecosystem.
7.1.summary.12.3	Review Figure 1.10, Activity 1.1 1.2
7.1.summary.13.1	Biologists Investigate Life through Experiments That Test Hypotheses
7.1.summary.14.1	Scientific methods combine observation, the gathering of information (data), experimentation, and the application of logic to study the natural world.
7.1.summary.14.2	Many scientific investigations involve five steps: making observations, asking questions, forming hypotheses, making predictions, and testing those predictions.
7.1.summary.14.3	Review Figure 1.12
7.1.summary.15.1	Hypotheses are tentative explanations of observations or answers to questions.
7.1.summary.15.2	Predictions made on the basis of a hypothesis are tested with additional observations and experiments.
7.1.summary.15.3	The two general types of experiments are comparative and controlled.
7.1.summary.15.4	Review Investigating Life: Corals in Hot Water, Animation 1.1
7.1.summary.16.1	Quantifiable data are critical in evaluating hypotheses.
7.1.summary.16.2	Statistical methods are applied to quantitative data to establish whether the differences observed could be the result of chance.

7.2.8.1	Tracking a Dinosaur
7.2.9.1	&#x201C;You are what you eat&#8212;and that applies to teeth&#x201D; is a modification of a famous saying about body chemistry.
7.2.9.2	One of the important atoms in organisms is oxygen (O), which is part of water (H2O).
7.2.9.3	Oxygen has two naturally occurring variants called isotopes; they have the same chemical properties but different weights because their nuclei have different numbers of neutrons.
7.2.9.4	Both isotopes of O are incorporated into the bodies of animals that consume the isotopes in water and food.
7.2.10.1	The hard surface of teeth, called enamel, is made up largely of calcium phosphate, which contains oxygen atoms.
7.2.10.2	The iso-topic composition of the oxygen in enamel varies depending on where an animal was living when the enamel was made.
7.2.10.3	When water evaporates from the ocean, it forms clouds that move inland and release rain.
7.2.10.4	Water with the heavier isotope of O is heavier, and tends to fall more readily than water containing the lighter isotope.
7.2.10.5	As a result, regions of the world that are closer to the ocean receive rain containing more heavy water than do regions farther away, and these differences are reflected in the bodies of animals that dwell in these regions.
7.2.11.1	This property has been used to reveal an astounding fact about dinosaurs that lived in the great basins of southwestern North America about 150 million years ago.
7.2.11.2	Camarasaurus was big&#8211;up to 25 meters long and weighing up to 45 metric tons.
7.2.11.3	Henry Ficke from Colorado College analyzed the oxygen isotopes in the enamel of Camarasaurus fossils and found two kinds of teeth: Some had the heavy oxygen content typical of rains and rocks in the basin region.
7.2.11.4	But others, surprisingly, had a lower proportion of heavy oxygen, indicating that these animals had lived at higher elevations 300 km to the west.
7.2.11.5	This indicated for the first time that dinosaurs migrated a long way from west to east.
7.2.11.6	The reason for this migration is not clear.
7.2.11.7	Camarasaurus ate a plant-based diet, and perhaps the migration was directed at finding food.
7.2.12.1	Many biological phenomena are analyzed and understood in the context of chemistry.
7.2.12.2	You will learn, for example, that adding even one atom to a large molecule can change its character and function.
7.2.12.3	Analyzing the isotopes in dinosaur teeth is but one example of how chemical analysis has led to advances in biological science.

7.2.14.1	Chapter 2 continues with
7.2.15.1	2.1  Atomic Structure Explains the Properties of Matter
7.2.1.1.1	What are atoms?
7.2.1.2.1	An element consists of only one kind of atom
7.2.1.3.1	Each element has a unique number of protons
7.2.1.4.1	The number of neutrons differs among isotopes
7.2.1.5.1	The behavior of electrons determines chemical bonding and geometry
7.2.1.6.1	All matter is composed of atoms.
7.2.1.6.2	Atoms are tiny&#8212;more than a trillion (1012) of them could make up the period at the end of this sentence.
7.2.1.6.3	Atoms and their component particles have volume and mass, which are characteristics of all matter.
7.2.1.6.4	Mass is a measure of the quantity of matter present; the greater the mass, the greater the quantity of matter.
7.2.1.6.5	Atoms also have electric charges.
7.2.1.7.1	focus your learning
7.2.1.8.1	Six elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur) make up most of the matter found in living organisms.
7.2.1.9.1	Reactive atoms tend to gain or lose electrons from their valence (outer) shell in order to achieve a full valence shell, because a full valence shell confers stability.
7.2.1.10.1	The structure of an atom determines its properties.
7.2.1.1.1.1	Figure 2.1 The Structure of an Atom
7.2.1.1.2.1	Each atom consists of a dense, positively charged nucleus, around which one or more negatively charged electrons move (Figure 2.1).
7.2.1.1.2.2	The nucleus contains one or more positively charged protons and may contain one or more neutrons with no electric charge.
7.2.1.1.3.1	The mass of a proton serves as a standard unit of measure called the dalton (named after the English chemist John Dalton).
7.2.1.1.3.2	A single proton or neutron has a mass of about 1 dalton (Da), which is 1.7 &#215; 10&#8211;24 grams (0.0000000000000000000000017 g), but an electron is even tinier at 9 &#215; 10&#8211;28 g (0.0005 Da).
7.2.1.1.3.3	Because the mass of an electron is negligible compared with the mass of a proton or a neutron, the contribution of electrons to the mass of an atom can usually be ignored when measurements and calculations are made.
7.2.1.1.3.4	It is electrons, however, that determine how atoms will combine with other atoms to form stable associations.
7.2.1.1.4.1	Each proton has a positive electric charge, defined as +1 unit of charge.
7.2.1.1.4.2	An electron has a negative charge equal and opposite to that of a proton (&#8211;1).
7.2.1.1.4.3	The neutron, as its name suggests, is electrically neutral, so its charge is 0.
7.2.1.1.4.4	Charges that are different (+/&#8211;) attract each other, whereas charges that are alike (+/+, &#8211;/&#8211;) repel each other.
7.2.1.1.4.5	Generally, atoms are electrically neutral because the number of electrons in an atom equals the number of protons.
7.2.1.2.1.1	An element is a pure substance that contains only one kind of atom.
7.2.1.2.1.2	The element hydrogen consists only of hydrogen atoms; the element iron consists only of iron atoms.
7.2.1.2.1.3	The atoms of each element have certain characteristics or properties that distinguish them from the atoms of other elements.
7.2.1.2.1.4	These physical and chemical properties (how they interact with other atoms) depend on the numbers of particles the atoms contain.
7.2.1.2.2.1	There are 94 elements in nature, and at least another 24 have been made in physics laboratories.
7.2.1.2.2.2	About 98 percent of the tissue of every living organism (except in skeletons) is composed of just six elements: Carbon (symbol C) Hydrogen (H) Nitrogen (N) Oxygen (O) Phosphorus (P) Sulfur (S)
7.2.1.2.3.1	The biological roles of these elements will be our major concern in this book, but other elements are found in living organisms as well.
7.2.1.2.3.2	Sodium and potassium, for example, are essential for nerve function; calcium can act as a biological signal; iodine is a component of a vital hormone; and magnesium is bound to chlorophyll in plants.
7.2.1.3.1.1	An element differs from other elements by the number of protons in the nucleus of each of its atoms; the number of protons is designated the atomic number.
7.2.1.3.1.2	This atomic number is unique to each element and does not change.
7.2.1.3.1.3	The atomic number of helium is 2, and an atom of helium always has two protons; the atomic number of oxygen is 8, and an atom of oxygen always has eight protons.
7.2.1.3.1.4	Since the number of protons (and electrons) determines how an element behaves in chemical reactions, it is possible to arrange the elements in a table such that those with similar chemical properties are grouped together.
7.2.1.3.1.5	This is the familiar periodic table you see in Figure 2.2.
7.2.1.3.2.1	Figure 2.2 The Periodic Table
7.2.1.3.3.1	The periodic table groups all the elements according to their physical and chemical properties.
7.2.1.3.3.2	Elements 1   94 occur in nature; elements with atomic numbers greater than 94 were created in the laboratory.
7.2.1.3.4.1	Along with a definitive number of protons, every element except hydrogen has one or more neutrons in its nucleus.
7.2.1.3.4.2	The mass number of an atom is the total number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus.
7.2.1.3.4.3	The nucleus of a carbon atom contains six protons and six neutrons and has a mass number of 12.
7.2.1.3.4.4	Oxygen has eight protons and eight neutrons and has a mass number of 16.
7.2.1.3.4.5	Since the mass of an electron is negligible, the mass number is essentially the mass of the atom in daltons.
7.2.1.3.5.1	By convention, we often print the symbol for an element with the atomic number at the lower left and the mass number at the upper left, both immediately preceding the symbol.
7.2.1.3.5.2	Thus hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen can be written as 11H, 126C, and 168O, respectively.
7.2.1.4.1.1	In some elements, the number of neutrons in the atomic nucleus may vary.
7.2.1.4.1.2	Different isotopes of the same element have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons, as you saw in the story opening this chapter.
7.2.1.4.1.3	Many elements have several isotopes.
7.2.1.4.1.4	Generally, isotopes are formed when atoms combine and/or release particles (decay).
7.2.1.4.1.5	The isotopes of hydrogen shown here have special names, but for most elements their isotopes do not have special names.
7.2.1.4.2.1	The natural isotopes of carbon, for example, are 12C (six neutrons in the nucleus), 13C (seven neutrons), and 14C (eight neutrons).
7.2.1.4.2.2	Note that all three (called carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14) have six protons, so they are all carbon.
7.2.1.4.2.3	Most carbon atoms are 12C, about 1.1 percent are 13C, and a tiny fraction are 14C.
7.2.1.4.2.4	The carbon atoms that make up complex biological molecules are mostly 12C, but some are 13C.
7.2.1.4.2.5	The ratio of 13C:12C varies with location and can be used to identify biological samples whose origin is not known (Investigating Life: Determining Beef Source in Big Macs Using Isotope Analysis).
7.2.1.4.2.6	All carbon isotopes have virtually the same chemical reactivity, which is an important property for their use in experimental biology and medicine.
7.2.1.4.3.1	An element   s atomic weight (or relative atomic mass) is equivalent to the average of the mass numbers of a representative sample of atoms of that element, with all the isotopes in their normally occurring proportions.
7.2.1.4.3.2	More precisely, an element   s atomic weight is defined as the ratio of the average mass per atom of the element to 1/12 of the mass of an atom of 12C.
7.2.1.4.3.3	Because it is a ratio, atomic weight is a dimensionless physical quantity&#8212;it is not expressed in units.
7.2.1.4.3.4	The atomic weight of hydrogen, taking into account all of its isotopes and their typical abundances, is 1.00794.
7.2.1.4.3.5	This number is fractional because it is the average of the contributing masses of all of the isotopes.
7.2.1.4.3.6	This definition implies that in any given sample of hydrogen atoms of a particular element found on Earth, the average composition of isotopes will be constant.
7.2.1.4.3.7	But as you saw in the opening to this chapter, that is not necessarily so.
7.2.1.4.3.8	Some water has more of the heavy O isotopes.
7.2.1.4.3.9	So chemists are now listing atomic weights as ranges, for example, H: 1.00784&#8211;1.00811.

7.2.1.4.7.1	Original Paper: Martinelli, L., G. Nardoto, L. Chesson, F. Rinaldi, J. P. H.B. Ometto, T. Cerling and J. Ehleringer. 2011.

7.2.1.4.7.3	Food Chemistry 127: 1,712&#8211;1,718.
7.2.1.4.8.1	The Big Mac hamburger can be purchased in 35,000 outlets in 120 countries.
7.2.1.4.8.2	The recipe for the Big Mac is virtually the same everywhere; it is claimed that the burger has the same quality meat and nutritional quality everywhere it is served.
7.2.1.4.8.3	To investigate this claim, Lesley Chesson and James Ehleringer at the University of Utah compared the ratio of 13C:12C in Big Mac patties around the world to determine whether the meat had a local or a common source.
7.2.1.4.8.4	Beef cattle eat plant food, and carbon atoms from this food end up in meat.
7.2.1.4.8.5	In some types of plants, the ratio of 13C:12C is higher than in others.
7.2.1.4.8.6	Depending on which type of plants the cattle consume, the beef will also have a different 13C:12C ratio.

7.2.1.4.12.1	CONCLUSION  The Big Mac burger patties in the two countries have a different isotopic ratio of 13C:12C atoms, which reflects local sources for the beef.
7.2.1.4.12.2	The hypothesis is rejected.
7.2.1.4.13.1	work with the data
7.2.1.4.14.1	The experiment compared the meat in Big Macs served in 25 different countries by measuring the ratio of stable carbon isotopes (13C:12C) in samples of ten beef patties from each country.
7.2.1.4.14.2	The hypothesis was based on claims that the beef used in Big Macs comes from a single source, and that the 13C:12C ratio in patties found everywhere should thus be the same.
7.2.1.4.14.3	Table A shows the average the 13C:12C ratio for each of the 25 countries.

7.2.1.4.23.1	A work with the data exercise that accompanies this figure may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.2.1.4.24.1	Most isotopes are stable.
7.2.1.4.24.2	However, some, called radioisotopes, are unstable and spontaneously give off energy in the form of    (alpha),    (beta), or    (gamma) radiation from the atomic nucleus.
7.2.1.4.24.3	Known as radioactive decay, this release of energy transforms the original atom.
7.2.1.4.24.4	The type of transformation varies depending on the radioisotope, but some transformations result in a different number of protons, so that the original atom becomes a different element.
7.2.1.4.24.5	Figure 2.3 Tagging the Brain
7.2.1.4.25.1	Q: How could this technique be used in the clinic?
7.2.1.4.26.1	Scientists can detect released radiation from *radioisotopes.
7.2.1.4.26.2	For instance, if you feed an earthworm food containing a radioisotope, you can follow the worm   s path through the soil by using a detector called a Geiger counter.
7.2.1.4.26.3	Most atoms in living organisms are organized into stable associations called molecules.
7.2.1.4.26.4	If a radioisotope is incorporated into a molecule, it acts as a tag or label, allowing a researcher or physician to track the molecule in an experiment or in the body (Figure 2.3).
7.2.1.4.27.1	*connect the concepts Radioisotopes are also used to analyze biochemical pathways (see Key Concept 10.3) and to date fossils (see Key Concept 24.1).
7.2.1.4.28.1	Although radioisotopes are useful in research and in medicine, even a low dose of the radiation they emit has the potential to damage molecules and cells.
7.2.1.4.28.2	However, these damaging effects are sometimes used to our advantage; for example, the radiation from 60Co (cobalt-60) is used in medicine to kill cancer cells.
7.2.1.5.1.1	The number of electrons in an atom determines how it will combine with other atoms.
7.2.1.5.1.2	Biologists are interested in how chemical changes take place in living cells.
7.2.1.5.1.3	When considering atoms, they are concerned primarily with electrons because the behavior of electrons explains how chemical reactions occur.
7.2.1.5.1.4	Chemical reactions alter the atomic compositions of substances and thus alter their properties.
7.2.1.5.1.5	Reactions usually involve changes in the distribution of electrons between atoms.
7.2.1.5.2.1	The location of a given electron in an atom at any given time is impossible to determine.
7.2.1.5.2.2	We can only describe a volume of space within the atom where the electron is likely to be.
7.2.1.5.2.3	The region of space where the electron is found at least 90 percent of the time is the electron   s orbital.
7.2.1.5.2.4	Orbitals have characteristic shapes and orientations, and a given orbital can be occupied by a maximum of two electrons.
7.2.1.5.2.5	Thus any atom larger than helium (atomic number 2) must have electrons in two or more orbitals.
7.2.1.5.2.6	As we move from lighter to heavier atoms in the periodic table, the orbitals are filled in a specific sequence, in a series of what are known as electron shells, or energy levels, around the nucleus.
7.2.1.5.3.1	First shell: The innermost electron shell consists of just one orbital.
7.2.1.5.3.2	A hydrogen atom (1H) has one electron in its first shell; helium (2He) has two.
7.2.1.5.3.3	Atoms of all other elements have two or more shells to accommodate orbitals for additional electrons.
7.2.1.5.4.1	Second shell: The second shell contains four orbitals and hence holds up to eight electrons.
7.2.1.5.5.1	Additional shells: Elements with more than ten electrons have three or more electron shells.
7.2.1.5.5.2	The farther a shell is from the nucleus, the higher the energy level is for an electron occupying that shell.
7.2.1.5.6.1	The s orbitals fill with electrons first, and their electrons have the lowest energy level.
7.2.1.5.6.2	Subsequent shells have different numbers of orbitals, but the outermost shells usually hold only eight electrons.
7.2.1.5.6.3	In any atom, the outermost electron shell (the valence shell) determines how the atom combines with other atoms&#8212;that is, how the atom behaves chemically.
7.2.1.5.6.4	When a valence shell with four orbitals contains eight electrons, there are no unpaired electrons and the atom is stable&#8212;it is least likely to react with other atoms (Figure 2.4).
7.2.1.5.6.5	Examples of chemically stable elements are helium, neon, and argon.
7.2.1.5.6.6	By contrast, atoms that have one or more unpaired electrons in their outer shells are capable of reacting with other atoms.
7.2.1.5.7.1	Figure 2.4 Electron Shells Determine the Reactivity of Atoms Each shell can hold a specific maximum number of electrons.
7.2.1.5.7.2	Going out from the nucleus, each shell must be filled before electrons can occupy the next shell.
7.2.1.5.7.3	The energy level of an electron is higher in a shell farther from the nucleus.
7.2.1.5.7.4	An atom with unpaired electrons in its outermost shell can react (bond) with other atoms.
7.2.1.5.7.5	Note that the atoms in this figure are arranged similarly to their arrangement in the periodic table.
7.2.1.5.8.1	Atoms with unpaired electrons (i. e. , partially filled orbitals) in their outermost electron shells are unstable and will undergo reactions in order to fill their outermost shells.
7.2.1.5.8.2	Reactive atoms can attain stability either by sharing electrons with other atoms or by losing or gaining one or more electrons.
7.2.1.5.8.3	In either case, the atoms involved are bonded together into stable associations called molecules.
7.2.1.5.8.4	The tendency of atoms to form stable molecules so that they have eight electrons in their outermost shells is known as the octet rule.
7.2.1.5.8.5	Many atoms in biologically important molecules&#8212;for example, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)&#8212;follow this rule.
7.2.1.5.8.6	An important exception is hydrogen (H), which attains stability when two electrons occupy its single shell (consisting of just one s orbital).
7.2.1.5.9.1	2.1 recap
7.2.1.5.10.1	Living organisms are composed of the same set of chemical elements as the rest of the universe.

7.2.1.5.18.2	Explain your answer.
7.2.1.5.19.1	You have been introduced to the individual players on the biochemical stage&#8212;the atoms.
7.2.1.5.19.2	We have shown how the number of unpaired electrons in an atom   s valence shell drives its    quest for stability.  ?
7.2.1.5.19.3	Next we will describe the different types of chemical bonds that can lead to stability&#8212;joining atoms together into molecular structures with hosts of different properties.

7.2.2.10.1	A chemical bond is an attractive force that links two atoms together in a molecule.
7.2.2.10.2	There are several kinds of chemical bonds (Table 2.1).
7.2.2.10.3	In this section we will begin with covalent bonds, the strong bonds that result from the sharing of electrons.
7.2.2.10.4	Next we will examine ionic attractions, which form when an atom gains or loses one or more electrons to achieve stability.
7.2.2.10.5	We will then consider other, weaker kinds of interactions, including hydrogen bonds.
7.2.2.11.1	focus your learning
7.2.2.12.1	Covalent bonds are very stable and break only with a large input of energy.
7.2.2.13.1	Polar covalent bonds occur when two atoms share bonding electrons in an unequal fashion, whereas nonpolar covalent bonds occur when the bonding electrons are shared equally.
7.2.2.14.1	Hydrophilic interactions occur between polar molecules, and hydrophobic interactions occur between nonpolar molecules.
7.2.2.15.1	van der Waals forces are weak, noncovalent attractive forces that occur between any two atoms.
7.2.2.1.1.1	A covalent bond forms when two atoms attain stable electron numbers in their outermost shells by sharing one or more pairs of electrons.
7.2.2.1.1.2	Consider two hydrogen atoms coming close to one another, each with an unpaired electron in its single shell (Figure 2.5).
7.2.2.1.1.3	When the electrons pair up, a stable association is formed, and this links the two hydrogen atoms in a covalent bond, forming the molecule H2.
7.2.2.1.1.4	Figure 2.5 Electrons Are Shared in Covalent Bonds
7.2.2.1.2.1	A compound is a pure substance made up of two or more different elements bonded together in a fixed ratio.
7.2.2.1.2.2	Chemical symbols identify the different elements in a compound, and subscript numbers indicate how many atoms of each element are present (e. g. , H2O has two atoms of hydrogen bonded to a single oxygen atom).
7.2.2.1.2.3	Every compound has a molecular weight that is the sum of the atomic weights of all atoms in the molecule.
7.2.2.1.2.4	Looking at the periodic table in Figure 2.2, you can calculate the molecular weight of water to be 18.01.
7.2.2.1.2.5	(But remember that this value comes from the average atomic weights of hydrogen and oxygen; the molecular weight of the heavy water in our opening story is higher because it is formed from heavier isotopes. )
7.2.2.1.2.6	Molecules that make up living organisms can have molecular weights of up to half a billion.

7.2.2.1.7.6	The space-filling model indicates the overall shape and surface of the molecule.
7.2.2.1.7.7	In the chapters that follow, different conventions will be used to depict molecules.
7.2.2.1.7.8	Bear in mind that these are models to illustrate certain properties, not accurate portrayals of how atoms would actually appear.
7.2.2.1.8.1	Q: Draw the four representations for carbon dioxide.
7.2.2.1.9.1	How are the covalent bonds formed in a molecule of methane gas (CH4)?
7.2.2.1.9.2	The carbon atom has six electrons: two electrons fill its inner shell, and four unpaired electrons travel in its outer shell.
7.2.2.1.9.3	Because its outer shell can hold up to eight electrons, carbon can share electrons with up to four other atoms&#8212;it can form four covalent bonds (Focus: Key Figure 2.6A).
7.2.2.1.9.4	When an atom of carbon reacts with four hydrogen atoms, methane forms.
7.2.2.1.9.5	Thanks to electron sharing, the outer shell of methane   s carbon atom is now filled with eight electrons, a stable configuration.
7.2.2.1.9.6	The outer shell of each of the four hydrogen atoms is also filled.
7.2.2.1.9.7	Four covalent bonds&#8212;four shared electron pairs&#8212;hold methane together.
7.2.2.1.9.8	Focus: Key Figure 2.6B shows several different ways to represent the molecular structure of methane.
7.2.2.1.9.9	Table 2.2 shows the covalent bonding capacities of some biologically significant elements.
7.2.0.0.1.1	Covalent bonds are very strong, meaning that it takes a lot of energy to break them.
7.2.0.0.1.2	At temperatures where life exists, the covalent bonds of biological molecules are quite stable, as are their three-dimensional structures.
7.2.0.0.1.3	However, this stability does not preclude change, as you will see.
7.2.0.0.1.1	For a given pair of elements &#8212; for example, carbon bonded to hydrogen &#8212; the length of the covalent bond is always the same.
7.2.0.0.1.2	And for a given atom within a molecule, the angle of each of its covalent bonds, with respect to the other bonds, is generally the same.
7.2.0.0.1.3	This is true regardless of the type of larger molecule that contains the atom.
7.2.0.0.1.4	For example, the four filled orbitals around the carbon atom in methane are always distributed in space so that the bonded hydrogen atoms point to the corners of a regular tetrahedron, with carbon in the center (see Figure 2.6B).
7.2.0.0.1.5	Even when carbon is bonded to four atoms other than hydrogen, this three-dimensional orientation is more or less maintained.
7.2.0.0.1.6	The orientation of covalent bonds in space gives the molecules their three-dimensional geometry, and the shapes of molecules contribute to their biological functions (see Key Concept 3.1).
7.2.0.0.2.1	table 2.2 Covalent Bonding Capabilities of Some Biologically Important Elements Element Usual number of covalent bonds Hydrogen (H) 1 Oxygen (O) 2 Sulfur (S) 2 Nitrogen (N) 3 Carbon (C) 4 Phosphorus (P) 5
7.2.0.0.3.1	Even though the orientations of bonds around each atom are fairly stable, the shapes of molecules can change.
7.2.0.0.3.2	Think of a single covalent bond as an axle around which the two atoms, along with their other bonded atoms, can rotate.
7.2.0.0.4.1	Bond rotation has enormous implications for the large molecules that make up living tissues.
7.2.0.0.4.2	SInce long chains of atoms (especially carbons) can rotate freely, there are many possibilities for the arrangement of atoms within the chain.
7.2.0.0.4.3	This allows molecules to alter their structures, for example, to fit other molecules.
7.2.0.0.1.1	Two atoms can share more than one pair of electrons, forming multiple covalent bonds.
7.2.0.0.1.2	These can be represented by lines between the chemical symbols for the linked atoms:
7.2.0.0.2.1	A single bond involves the sharing of a single pair of electrons (for example, H&#8212;H or C&#8212;H).
7.2.0.0.3.1	A double bond involves the sharing of four electrons (two pairs) (C=C).
7.2.0.0.4.1	Triple bonds&#8212;six shared electrons&#8212;are rare, but there is one in nitrogen gas (N   N), which is the major component of the air we breathe.
7.2.0.0.1.1	If two atoms of the same element are covalently bonded, there is an equal sharing of the pair(s) of electrons in their outermost shells.
7.2.0.0.1.2	However, when the two atoms are of different elements, the sharing is not necessarily equal.
7.2.0.0.1.3	One nucleus may exert a greater attractive force on the electron pair than the other nucleus, so that the pair tends to be closer to that atom.
7.2.0.0.2.1	The attractive force that an atomic nucleus exerts on electrons is called its electronegativity.
7.2.0.0.2.2	The electronegativity of an atom depends roughly on how many positive charges it has (atoms with more protons are more positive and thus more attractive to electrons) and on the distance between the nucleus and the electrons in the outer (valence) shell (the closer the electrons, the greater the electronegative pull).
7.2.0.0.2.3	Table 2.3 shows the electronegativities (which are calculated to produce dimensionless quantities) of some elements important in biological systems.
7.2.0.0.2.4	Note that oxygen (O) is very electronegative; in fact, oxygen is the second most electronegative element (after fluorine).
7.2.0.0.2.5	Many organisms exploit the negativity of oxygen; moving electrons between C and O atoms powers living systems, as you will see in many subsequent examples in this text.
7.2.0.0.3.1	table 2.3 Some Electronegativities Element Electronegativity Oxygen (O) 3.5 Chlorine (Cl) 3.1 Nitrogen (N) 3.0 Carbon (C) 2.5 Phosphorus (P) 2.1 Hydrogen (H) 2.1 Sodium (Na) 0.9 Potassium (K) 0.8
7.2.0.0.4.1	If two atoms are close to one another in electronegativity, they will share electrons equally in what is called a nonpolar covalent bond.
7.2.0.0.4.2	Two oxygen atoms, for example, each with an electronegativity of 3.5, will share electrons equally.
7.2.0.0.4.3	So will two hydrogen atoms (each with an electronegativity of 2.1).
7.2.0.0.4.4	But when hydrogen bonds with oxygen to form water, the electrons involved are unequally shared; they tend to be nearer to the oxygen nucleus because it is more electronegative than hydrogen.
7.2.0.0.4.5	When electrons are drawn to one nucleus more than to the other, the result is a polar covalent bond (Figure 2.7).
7.2.0.0.4.6	Figure 2.7 Water&#8217;s Covalent Bonds Are Polar
7.2.0.0.5.1	Because of this unequal sharing of electrons, the oxygen end of the hydrogen&#8211;oxygen bond has a slightly negative charge (symbolized by   &#8211; and spoken of as    delta negative,  ? meaning a partial unit of charge), and the hydrogen end has a slightly positive charge (  +).
7.2.0.0.5.2	The bond is polar because these opposite charges are separated at the two ends, or poles, of the bond.
7.2.0.0.5.3	The partial charges that result from polar covalent bonds produce polar molecules or polar regions of large molecules.
7.2.0.0.5.4	Polar bonds within molecules greatly influence the interactions they have with other polar molecules.
7.2.0.0.5.5	Water (H2O) is a polar compound, and this polarity has significant effects on its physical properties and chemical reactivity, as you will see in later chapters.
7.2.0.2.1.1	When one interacting atom is much more electronegative than the other, a complete transfer of one or more electrons may take place.
7.2.0.2.1.2	Consider sodium (electronegativity 0.9) and chlorine (electronegativity 3.1).
7.2.0.2.1.3	A sodium atom has only one electron in its outermost shell; this condition is unstable.
7.2.0.2.1.4	A chlorine atom has seven electrons in its outermost shell&#8212;another unstable condition.
7.2.0.2.1.5	Since the electronegativity of chlorine is so much greater than that of sodium, any electrons involved in bonding will tend to transfer completely from sodium   s outermost shell to that of chlorine (Figure 2.8).
7.2.0.2.1.6	This reaction between sodium and chlorine makes the resulting atoms more stable because they both have eight fully paired electrons in their outer shells.
7.2.0.2.1.7	The result is two ions.
7.2.0.2.1.8	Figure 2.8 Formation of Sodium and Chloride Ions
7.2.0.2.2.1	Q: What ions are formed when calcium ion reacts with chlorine?
7.2.0.2.2.2	See the periodic table in Figure 2.2.
7.2.0.2.3.1	Ions are electrically charged particles that form when atoms gain or lose one or more electrons:
7.2.0.2.4.1	The sodium ion (Na+) in our example has a +1 unit of charge because it has one less electron than it has protons.
7.2.0.2.4.2	The outermost electron shell of the sodium ion is full, with eight electrons, so the ion is stable.
7.2.0.2.4.3	Positively charged ions are called cations.
7.2.0.2.4.4	Other biologically important cations include Ca2+, H+, Mg2+, and K+.
7.2.0.2.5.1	The chloride ion (Cl&#8211;) has a &#8211;1 unit of charge because it has one more electron than it has protons.
7.2.0.2.5.2	This additional electron gives Cl&#8211; a stable outermost shell with eight electrons.
7.2.0.2.5.3	Negatively charged ions are called anions.
7.2.0.2.6.1	Some elements can form ions with multiple charges by losing or gaining more than one electron.
7.2.0.2.6.2	Examples are Ca2+ (the calcium ion, a calcium atom that has lost two electrons) and Mg2+ (the magnesium ion).
7.2.0.2.6.3	Two biologically important elements can each yield more than one stable ion.
7.2.0.2.6.4	Iron yields Fe2+ (the ferrous ion) and Fe3+ (the ferric ion), and copper yields Cu+ (the cuprous ion) and Cu2+ (the cupric ion).
7.2.0.2.6.5	Groups of covalently bonded atoms that carry an electric charge are called complex ions; examples include NH4+ (the ammonium ion), SO42&#8211; (the sulfate ion), and PO43&#8211; (the phosphate ion).
7.2.0.2.6.6	Once formed, ions are usually stable and no more electrons are lost or gained.
7.2.0.2.7.1	Ionic attractions are bonds formed as a result of the electrical attraction between ions bearing opposite charges.
7.2.0.2.7.2	Ions can form bonds that result in stable solid compounds, which we call salts.
7.2.0.2.7.3	You   re familiar with sodium chloride (NaCl)&#8212;table salt; its cations (Na+) and anions (Cl&#8211;) are held together by ionic attractions.
7.2.0.2.7.4	In solids, the attractions are strong because the ions are close together.
7.2.0.2.7.5	However, when ions are dispersed in water, the distances between them can be large, greatly reducing the strength of the attraction.
7.2.0.2.7.6	Under the conditions in living cells, an ionic attraction is less strong than a covalent bond (see Table 2.1).
7.2.0.2.7.7	Figure 2.9 Water Molecules Surround Ions
7.2.0.2.8.1	Q: What happens at the chemical and physical levels when a salt solution evaporates?
7.2.0.2.9.1	Not surprisingly, ions can interact with polar molecules, since both are charged.
7.2.0.2.9.2	This interaction results when a solid salt such as NaCl dissolves in water.
7.2.0.2.9.3	Water molecules surround the individual ions, separating them (Figure 2.9).
7.2.0.2.9.4	The negatively charged chloride ions attract the positive poles of the water molecules, while the positively charged sodium ions attract the negative poles of the water molecules.
7.2.0.2.9.5	This special property of water (its polarity) is one reason it is such a good biological solvent (see Key Concept 2.4).
7.2.0.3.1.1	In liquid water, the negatively charged oxygen (  &#8211;) atom of one water molecule is attracted to the positively charged hydrogen (  +) atoms of another water molecule (Figure 2.10A).
7.2.0.3.1.2	The bond resulting from this attraction is called a hydrogen bond.
7.2.0.3.1.3	Later in this chapter you   ll see how hydrogen bonding between water molecules contributes to many of the properties that make water so important for living systems.
7.2.0.3.1.4	Hydrogen bonds are not restricted to water molecules.
7.2.0.3.1.5	Such a bond can also form between a strongly electronegative atom in one molecule and a hydrogen atom that is involved in a polar covalent bond in another molecule, or another part of the same molecule (Figure 2.10B).
7.2.0.3.1.6	Figure 2.10 Hydrogen Bonds Can Form between or within Molecules
7.2.0.3.2.1	Q: What happens to a large molecule if increasing heat is applied?
7.2.0.3.2.2	Which bonds or interactions are affected?
7.2.0.3.3.1	A hydrogen bond is weaker than most ionic attractions because its formation is due to partial charges (  + and   &#8211;).
7.2.0.3.3.2	It is much weaker than a covalent bond between a hydrogen atom and an oxygen atom (see Table 2.1).
7.2.0.3.3.3	Although individual hydrogen bonds are weak, there can be many of them within a single molecule or between two molecules.
7.2.0.3.3.4	In these cases, the hydrogen bonds together have considerable strength and can greatly influence the structure and properties of substances.
7.2.0.3.3.5	For example, hydrogen bonds play important roles in determining and maintaining the three-dimensional shapes of giant molecules such as DNA and proteins (see Key Concept 3.2).
7.2.0.4.1.1	Figure 2.11 Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic
7.2.0.4.2.1	Just as water molecules can interact with one another through hydrogen bonds, any molecule that is polar can interact with other polar molecules through the weak (  + to   &#8211;) attractions of hydrogen bonds.
7.2.0.4.2.2	If a polar molecule interacts with water in this way, it is called hydrophilic (   water-loving  ?) (Figure 2.11A).
7.2.0.4.3.1	Nonpolar molecules, in contrast, tend to interact with other nonpolar molecules.
7.2.0.4.3.2	For example, carbon (electronegativity 2.5) forms nonpolar bonds with hydrogen (electronegativity 2.1), and molecules containing only hydrogen and carbon atoms&#8212;called hydrocarbon molecules&#8212;are nonpolar.
7.2.0.4.3.3	In water these molecules tend to aggregate with one another rather than with the polar water molecules.
7.2.0.4.3.4	Therefore nonpolar molecules are known as hydrophobic (   water-hating  ?), and the interactions between them are called hydrophobic interactions (Figure 2.11B).
7.2.0.4.3.5	Of course, hydrophobic substances do not really    hate  ? water; they can form weak interactions with it, since the electronegativities of carbon and hydrogen are not exactly the same.
7.2.0.4.3.6	But these interactions are far weaker than the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules (see Table 2.1), so the nonpolar substances tend to aggregate.
7.2.0.5.1.1	The interactions between nonpolar substances are enhanced by van der Waals forces, which occur when the atoms of two molecules are in close proximity.
7.2.0.5.1.2	These brief interactions result from random variations in the electron distribution in one molecule, which can create opposite charge distributions in the adjacent molecule.
7.2.0.5.1.3	So there will be a weak, temporary   + to   &#8211; attraction. van der Waals forces occur in polar and nonpolar molecules.
7.2.0.5.1.4	In the latter case, they can induce cohesion between molecules that do not form ionic attractions of hydrogen bonds.
7.2.0.5.1.5	Although a single van der Waals interaction is brief and weak, the sum of many such interactions over the entire span of a large nonpolar molecule can result in substantial attraction.
7.2.0.5.1.6	This is important when hydrophobic regions of different molecules such as an enzyme and a substrate come together (see Chapter 8).
7.2.0.5.2.1	2.2 recap
7.2.0.5.3.1	Some atoms form strong covalent bonds with other atoms by sharing one or more pairs of electrons.
7.2.0.5.3.2	Unequal sharing of electrons produces polarity.
7.2.0.5.3.3	Other atoms become ions by losing or gaining electrons, and they interact with other ions or polar molecules.
7.2.0.5.3.4	Weak forces such as hydrogen bonds also act to attract atoms to one another.
7.2.0.5.4.1	learning outcomes
7.2.0.5.5.1	You should be able to:
7.2.0.5.6.1	Explain why covalent bonds are so strong.

7.2.0.5.15.1	whether the atom pair contributes hydrophilic or hydrophobic properties to a molecule
7.2.0.5.16.1	Geckos are lizards that are amazing climbers.
7.2.0.5.16.2	A gecko can climb up a glass surface and stick to it with a single toe.
7.2.0.5.16.3	Professor Kellar Autumn at Lewis and Clark College and his students and collaborators have shown that each toe of a gecko has millions of micrometer-sized hairs, and that each hair splits into hundreds of 200-nanometer tips that provide intimate contact with a surface.
7.2.0.5.16.4	Careful measurements show that a million of these tips could easily support the animal, but it has far more.
7.2.0.5.16.5	The toes stick well on hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces.
7.2.0.5.16.6	Bending the hairs allows the gecko to detach.
7.2.0.5.16.7	What kind of noncovalent force is involved in gecko sticking?
7.2.0.5.17.1	The bonding of atoms into molecules is not necessarily a permanent affair.
7.2.0.5.17.2	The dynamic aspect of life involves constant change, even at the molecular level.
7.2.0.5.17.3	In the next section we will examine how molecules interact with one another&#8212;how they break up, how they find new partners, and what the consequences of those changes can be.
7.2.0.5.18.1	Chapter 2 continues with
7.2.0.5.19.1	2.3  Atoms Change Partners in Chemical Reactions
7.2.3.1.1	A hallmark of life is that it is dynamic.
7.2.3.1.2	Things don   t sit still, especially at the chemical level.
7.2.3.1.3	Atoms bonded to other atoms can leave a binding relationship and find a new partner.
7.2.3.1.4	Bear in mind that this does not happen all the time: your skin is a biological tissue, and its atoms form a stable structure.
7.2.3.1.5	But change is common, especially among the atoms and molecules dissolved in water.
7.2.3.1.6	A chemical reaction occurs when moving atoms collide with sufficient energy to combine or to change their bonding partners.

7.2.3.3.1	Chemical reactions obey the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of matter.

7.2.3.4.2	Figure 2.12 Bonding Partners and Energy May Change in a Chemical Reaction
7.2.3.5.1	Consider the combustion reaction that takes place in the flame of a propane stove.
7.2.3.5.2	When propane (C3H8) reacts with oxygen gas (O2), the carbon atoms become bonded to oxygen atoms instead of hydrogen atoms, and the hydrogen atoms become bonded to oxygen instead of carbon (Figure 2.12).
7.2.3.5.3	As the covalently bonded atoms change partners, the composition of the matter changes; propane and oxygen gas become carbon dioxide and water.
7.2.3.5.4	This chemical reaction can be represented by the equation C3H8 + 5 O2     3 CO2 + 4 H2O + Energy Reactants     Products
7.2.3.6.1	In this equation, propane and oxygen are the reactants, and carbon dioxide and water are the  products.
7.2.3.6.2	This example is an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction   a special type of chemical reaction that involves a transfer of electrons between two species:
7.2.3.7.1	The electron acceptor, or oxidizing agent, gains electrons and is said to be reduced  in a chemical reaction.
7.2.3.8.1	The electron donor, or reducing agent, loses electrons and is said to be is oxidized in a chemical reaction.
7.2.3.9.1	Can you identify the oxidizing and reducing agents in our example?
7.2.3.9.2	Because electrons and protons (i. e. , hydrogen atoms) are transferred from propane, propane is the reducing agent and oxygen is the oxidizing agent, which in this example forms water upon accepting the hydrogens.
7.2.3.9.3	You will see many examples of redox reactions involving electron/proton transfer in later chapters.
7.2.3.9.4	Figure 2.13 Hydrogen Bonding and the Properties of Water
7.2.3.10.1	The products of a chemical reaction can have very different properties from the reactants.
7.2.3.10.2	The reaction shown in Figure 2.13 is said to be complete: all the propane and oxygen are used up in forming the two products.
7.2.3.10.3	The arrow symbolizes the direction of the chemical reaction.
7.2.3.10.4	The numbers preceding the molecular formulas indicate how many molecules are used or produced.
7.2.3.11.1	Note that in this and all other chemical reactions, matter is neither created nor destroyed.
7.2.3.11.2	The total number of carbon atoms on the left side of the equation (3) equals the total number of carbon atoms on the right (3).
7.2.3.11.3	In other words, the equation is balanced.
7.2.3.11.4	However, there is another aspect of this reaction: the heat and light of the stove   s flame reveal that the reaction between propane and oxygen releases a great deal of energy.
7.2.3.12.1	Energy is defined as the capacity to do work, but in the context of chemical reactions, it can be thought of as the capacity for change.
7.2.3.12.2	Chemical reactions do not create or destroy energy, but changes in the form of energy usually accompany chemical reactions.
7.2.3.13.1	In the reaction between propane and oxygen, a large amount of heat energy is released.
7.2.3.13.2	This energy was present in another form, called potential chemical energy, in the covalent bonds within the propane and oxygen gas molecules.
7.2.3.13.3	Not all reactions release energy; indeed, many chemical reactions require that energy be supplied from the environment.
7.2.3.13.4	Some of this energy is then stored as potential chemical energy in the bonds formed in the products.
7.2.3.13.5	We will see in future chapters how reactions that release energy and reactions that require energy are often coupled.
7.2.3.14.1	Many chemical reactions take place in living cells, and some of these have a lot in common with the oxidation   reduction reaction we saw in the combustion of propane.
7.2.3.14.2	In cells, the reactants are different (they may be sugars or fats), and the reactions proceed by many intermediate steps that permit the released energy to be harvested and put to use by the cells.
7.2.3.14.3	But the products are the same: carbon dioxide and water.
7.2.3.15.1	2.3 recap
7.2.3.16.1	In a chemical reaction, a set of reactants is converted to a set of products with different chemical compositions.
7.2.3.16.2	A chemical reaction involves breaking old bonds and making new ones.
7.2.3.16.3	A reaction may release energy or require its input.
7.2.3.17.1	learning outcomes
7.2.3.18.1	You should be able to:
7.2.3.19.1	Demonstrate an example to show that chemical reactions obey the law of conservation of matter.
7.2.3.20.1	Explain how energy is involved in a chemical reaction.
7.2.3.21.1	Using the example of the chemical equation C6H12O6 + O2 &#8594; CO2 + H2O, insert numbers so that the numbers of atoms on both sides of the equation are balanced.
7.2.3.22.1	Use an example to explain how the form of energy can change during a chemical reaction.
7.2.3.23.1	We will return to chemical reactions and how they occur in living systems in Chapter 8, 9, and 10, focusing particularly on energy transformations that fuel biological processes.
7.2.3.23.2	First, however, we will examine the unique properties of the substance in which most biochemical reactions take place: water.
7.2.3.24.1	Chapter 2 continues with

7.2.4.12.1	buffers
7.2.4.13.1	Your body is more than 70 percent water by weight, excluding the minerals contained in bones.
7.2.4.13.2	Water is the dominant component of virtually all living organisms, and most biochemical reactions take place in this watery, or aqueous, environment.
7.2.4.13.3	Water is an unusual substance with unusual properties.
7.2.4.13.4	Under conditions on Earth, water exists in solid, liquid, and gas forms, all of which have relevance to living systems.
7.2.4.13.5	Water allows chemical reactions to occur inside living organisms, and it is necessary for the formation of certain biological structures.
7.2.4.13.6	In this section we will explore how the structure and interactions of water molecules make water essential to life.
7.2.4.14.1	focus your learning
7.2.4.15.1	Biochemical reactions within cells occur in an aqueous environment.
7.2.4.16.1	Moles are used to quantify substances in biological fluids.
7.2.4.17.1	The acid-base properties of water and other compounds in cells allow reversible changes that affect biological functions.
7.2.4.1.1.1	The molecule H2O has unique chemical features.
7.2.4.1.1.2	As you have already learned, water is a polar molecule that can form hydrogen bonds.
7.2.4.1.1.3	The four pairs of electrons in the outer shell of the oxygen atom repel one another, giving the water molecule a tetrahedral shape:
7.2.4.1.2.1	The chemical features of water explain some of its interesting properties, such as the ability of ice to float, the melting and freezing temperatures of water, the ability of water to store heat, the formation of water droplets, water&#8217;s ability to dissolve many substances, and its inability to dissolve many others.
7.2.0.0.1.1	In water&#8217;s solid state (ice), individual water molecules are held in place by hydrogen bonds.
7.2.0.0.1.2	Each molecule is bonded to four other molecules in a rigid, crystalline structure (Figure 2.13).
7.2.0.0.1.3	Although the molecules are held firmly in place, they are farther apart from one another than they are in liquid water, where the molecules are moving about.
7.2.0.0.1.4	In ice, there are cavities between individual water molecules.
7.2.0.0.1.5	In other words, solid water is less dense than liquid water, which is why ice floats.
7.2.0.0.2.1	Think of the biological consequences if ice were to sink in water.
7.2.0.0.2.2	A pond would freeze from the bottom up, becoming a solid block of ice in winter and killing most of the organisms living there.
7.2.0.0.2.3	Once the whole pond was frozen, its temperature could drop well below the freezing point of water.
7.2.0.0.2.4	But because ice floats, it forms an insulating layer on the top of the pond, and reduces heat flow to the cold air above.
7.2.0.0.2.5	Thus fish, plants, and other organisms in the pond are not subjected to temperatures lower than 0  C, which is the freezing point of pure water.
7.2.0.0.1.1	Compared with many other substances that have molecules of similar size, ice requires a great deal of heat energy to melt.
7.2.0.0.1.2	The amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of a substance by 1  C is called its specific heat.
7.2.0.0.1.3	Water has a relatively high specific heat because so many hydrogen bonds connecting the water molecules in ice must be broken to change water from solid to liquid.
7.2.0.0.1.4	In the opposite process&#8212;freezing&#8212;a great deal of energy is released to the environment.
7.2.0.0.1.5	We say water has a high heat capacity.
7.2.0.0.1.6	For example, water has twice the specific heat of ethyl alcohol and five times that of sand.
7.2.0.0.1.7	This is why when you are on the beach as the sun sets, the sand cools much more quickly than the water.
7.2.0.0.2.1	Because it takes a lot of energy to change the physical state of water, water temperatures in oceans and other large bodies of water are remarkably constant throughout the year.
7.2.0.0.2.2	The temperature changes of coastal land masses are in turn moderated by large bodies of water.
7.2.0.0.2.3	Indeed, water helps minimize variations in atmospheric temperature across the planet.
7.2.0.0.2.4	Water&#8217;s ability to moderate heat helps it function as an insulator, helping prevent an organism&#8217;s body temperature from rising during a sunny day.
7.2.0.0.2.5	Figure 2.14 Water in Biology
7.2.0.0.3.1	Water also has a high heat of vaporization, which means that a lot of heat is required to change water from its liquid to its gaseous state (the process of evaporation).
7.2.0.0.3.2	Once again, much of the heat energy is used to break the many hydrogen bonds between the water molecules.
7.2.0.0.3.3	This heat must be absorbed from the environment in contact with the water. *Evaporation thus has a cooling effect on the environment&#8212;whether a leaf, a forest, or an entire land mass.
7.2.0.0.3.4	This effect explains why sweating cools the human body: as sweat evaporates from the skin, it uses up some of the adjacent body heat (Figure 2.14A).
7.2.0.0.4.1	*connect the concepts Living systems use the evaporation of water, which disrupts hydrogen bonds, to dissipate excess heat that would otherwise cause problems.
7.2.0.0.4.2	See Key Concept 39.3 for examples in plants, and Key Concepts 40.3&#8211;40.5 for examples in animals.
7.2.0.1.0-2.1.1	In liquid water, individual molecules are able to move about.
7.2.0.1.0-2.1.2	The hydrogen bonds between the molecules continually form and break (see Figure 2.14).
7.2.0.1.0-2.1.3	Chemists estimate that this occurs about a trillion times a minute for a single water molecule!
7.2.0.1.0-2.2.1	At any given time, a water molecule forms on average 3.4 hydrogen bonds with other water molecules.
7.2.0.1.0-2.2.2	These hydrogen bonds explain the cohesive strength of liquid water.
7.2.0.1.0-2.2.3	This cohesive strength, or cohesion, is defined as the capacity of water molecules to resist coming apart from one another when placed under tension.
7.2.0.1.0-2.2.4	Water&#8217;s *cohesive strength permits narrow columns of liquid water to move from the roots to the leaves of tall trees.
7.2.0.1.0-2.2.5	When water evaporates from the leaves, the entire column moves upward in response to the pull of the molecules at the top (Figure 2.14B).
7.2.0.1.0-2.2.6	A related property is adhesion, the attraction of water molecules to other molecules of a different type.
7.2.0.1.0-2.2.7	For example, when you put a straw into a cup with water, it "climbs" up the straw so the column is higher than the level in the cup.
7.2.0.1.0-2.2.8	This adhesive behavior of water&#8212;sticking to the sides of the straw&#8212;reflects the adhesion of water forming the column. *connect the concepts As described in Key Concept 35.2, the transpiration&#8211;cohesion&#8211;tension mechanism accounts for the movement of water from roots to leaves.
7.2.0.1.0-2.2.9	Because of the cohesion between water molecules, water is pulled upward in continuous columns.
7.2.0.1.0-2.3.1	The surface of liquid water exposed to the air is difficult to puncture because the water molecules at the surface are hydrogen-bonded to other water molecules below them.
7.2.0.1.0-2.3.2	This surface tension of water permits a container to be filled slightly above its rim without overflowing, and it permits spiders to walk on the surface of a pond (Figure 2.14C).
7.2.0.2.1.1	A solution is produced when a substance (the solute) is dissolved in a liquid (the solvent).
7.2.0.2.1.2	If the solvent is water, then the solution is called an aqueous solution.
7.2.0.2.1.3	As you know by now, water is polar.
7.2.0.2.1.4	Because many important molecules in biological systems are polar, they readily dissolve in water.
7.2.0.2.1.5	Being soluble doesn&#8217;t mean that the molecules lose their identity and properties.
7.2.0.2.1.6	They can still react, and indeed many important biochemical reactions occur in aqueous solutions.
7.2.0.2.2.1	Biologists who are interested in the biochemical reactions within cells identify the reactants and products and determine their amounts using two different types of analyses:
7.2.0.2.3.1	Qualitative analyses focus on identifying the substances involved in chemical reactions.
7.2.0.2.3.2	For example, a qualitative analysis would be used to investigate the steps involved and the products formed during respiration, when carbon-containing compounds are broken down to release energy in living tissues.
7.2.0.2.4.1	Quantitative analyses measure concentrations or amounts of substances.
7.2.0.2.4.2	For example, a biochemist would use a quantitative analysis to measure how much of a certain product is formed in a chemical reaction.
7.2.0.2.4.3	What follows is a brief introduction to some of the quantitative chemical terms you will see in this book.
7.2.0.2.5.1	Fundamental to quantitative thinking in chemistry and biology is the concept of the mole.
7.2.0.2.5.2	A mole is the amount of a substance (in grams) that is numerically equal to its molecular weight.
7.2.0.2.5.3	So a mole of hydrogen gas (H2) weighs 2 g, a mole of sodium ion (Na+) weighs 23 g, and a mole of table sugar (C12H22O11) weighs about 342 g.
7.2.0.2.6.1	Quantitative analyses do not yield counts of molecules.
7.2.0.2.6.2	Because the amount of a substance in 1 mole is directly related to its molecular weight, it follows that the number of molecules in 1 mole is constant for all substances.
7.2.0.2.6.3	So 1 mole of salt contains the same number of molecules as 1 mole of table sugar.
7.2.0.2.6.4	This constant number of molecules in a mole is called Avogadro&#8217;s number, and it is 6.02 &#215; 1023 molecules per mole.
7.2.0.2.6.5	Chemists work with moles of substances (which can be weighed in the laboratory) instead of actual molecules, which are too numerous to be counted.
7.2.0.2.6.6	Consider 34.2 g (just over 1 ounce) of table sugar, C12H22O11.
7.2.0.2.6.7	This is one-tenth of a mole, or one-tenth of Avogadro&#8217;s number: 6.02 &#215; 1022 molecules.
7.2.0.2.7.1	A chemist can dissolve 1 mole of table sugar (342 g) in water to make 1 liter of solution, knowing that the mole contains 6.02 &#215; 1023 individual sugar molecules.
7.2.0.2.7.2	This solution&#8212;1 mole of a substance dissolved in water to make 1 liter&#8212;is called a 1 molar (1 M) solution.
7.2.0.2.7.3	When a physician injects a certain volume and molar concentration of a drug into the bloodstream of a patient, a rough calculation can be made of the actual number of drug molecules that will interact with the patient&#8217;s cells.
7.2.0.2.7.4	As you know, the dose is important.
7.2.0.2.8.1	The many molecules dissolved in the water of living tissues are not present at concentrations anywhere near 1 molar.
7.2.0.2.8.2	Most are in the micromolar (millionths of a mole per liter of solution;   M) to millimolar (thousandths of a mole per liter; mM) range.
7.2.0.2.8.3	Some, such as hormone molecules, are even less concentrated than that.
7.2.0.2.8.4	While these molarities seem to indicate very low concentrations, remember that even a 1   M solution has 6.02 &#215; 1017 molecules of the solute per liter.
7.2.0.3.1.1	When some substances dissolve in water, they release hydrogen ions (H+), which are actually single, positively charged protons.
7.2.0.3.1.2	Hydrogen ions can interact with other molecules and change their properties.
7.2.0.3.1.3	For example, the protons in &#8220;acid rain&#8221; can damage plants, and you probably have experienced the excess of hydrogen ions that we call &#8220;acid indigestion. &#8221; ?
7.2.0.3.2.1	Here we will examine the properties of acids (defined as substances that release H+) and bases (defined as substances that accept H+).
7.2.0.3.2.2	We will distinguish between strong and weak acids and bases, and provide a quantitative means for stating the concentration of H+ in solutions: the pH scale.
7.2.0.0.1.1	When hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added to water, it dissolves, releasing the ions H+ and Cl&#8211;: HCl     H+ + Cl&#8211;
7.2.0.0.2.1	Because its H+ concentration has increased, the solution is acidic.
7.2.0.0.3.1	Acids are substances that release H+ ions in solution.
7.2.0.0.3.2	HCl is an acid, as is H2SO4 (sulfuric acid).
7.2.0.0.3.3	One molecule of sulfuric acid will ionize to yield two H+ and one SO42&#8211;.
7.2.0.0.3.4	Biological compounds that contain &#8212;COOH (called a carboxyl group) are acids because the carboxyl group can ionize to &#8212;COO&#8211;, releasing H+: &#8212;COOH &#x2192; &#8212;COO&#8211; + H+
7.2.0.0.4.1	Acids that fully ionize in solution, such as HCl and H2SO4, are called strong acids.
7.2.0.0.4.2	However, not all acids ionize fully in water.
7.2.0.0.4.3	For example, if acetic acid (CH3COOH) is added to water, some of it will dissociate into two ions (CH3COO&#8211; and H+), but some of the original acetic acid will remain as well.
7.2.0.0.4.4	Because the reaction is not complete, acetic acid is a weak acid.
7.2.0.0.1.1	Bases are substances that accept H+ in solution.
7.2.0.0.1.2	As with acids, there are strong and weak bases.
7.2.0.0.1.3	If NaOH (sodium hydroxide) is added to water, it dissolves and ionizes, releasing OH&#8211; and Na+ ions: NaOH &#x2192; Na+ + OH&#8211;
7.2.0.0.2.1	Because OH&#8211; absorbs H+ to form water, such a solution is basic.
7.2.0.0.2.2	This reaction is complete, and so NaOH is a strong base.
7.2.0.0.3.1	Weak bases include the bicarbonate ion (HCO3&#8211;), which can accept an H+ ion and become carbonic acid (H2CO3), and ammonia (NH3), which can accept H+ and become an ammonium ion (NH4+).
7.2.0.0.3.2	Biological compounds that contain &#8212;NH2 (the amino group) are also bases because &#8212;NH2 accepts H+: &#8212;NH2 + H+ &#x2192; &#8212;NH3+
7.2.0.0.1.1	When acetic acid is dissolved in water, two reactions happen.
7.2.0.0.1.2	First, the acetic acid forms its ions: CH3COOH &#x2192; CH3COO&#8211; + H+
7.2.0.0.2.1	Then, once the ions are formed, some of them re-form acetic acid: CH3COO&#8211; + H+ &#x2192; CH3COOH
7.2.0.0.3.1	This pair of reactions is reversible.
7.2.0.0.3.2	A reversible reaction can proceed in either direction&#8212;left to right or right to left&#8212;depending on the relative starting concentrations of the reactants and products.
7.2.0.0.3.3	The formula for a reversible reaction can be written using a double arrow: CH3COOH ~ CH3COO&#8211; + H+
7.2.0.0.4.1	In terms of acids and bases, there are two types of reactions, depending on the extent of the reversibility:
7.2.0.0.5.1	The ionization of strong acids and bases in water is virtually irreversible.
7.2.0.0.6.1	The ionization of weak acids and bases in water is somewhat reversible.
7.2.0.0.1.1	The water molecule has a slight but significant tendency to ionize into a hydroxide ion (OH&#8211;) and a hydrogen ion (H+).
7.2.0.0.1.2	Actually, two water molecules participate in this reaction.
7.2.0.0.1.3	One of the two molecules &#x201C;captures&#x201D; a hydrogen ion from the other molecule, forming a hydroxide ion and a hydronium ion:
7.2.0.0.2.1	The hydronium ion is, in effect, a hydrogen ion bound to a water molecule.
7.2.0.0.2.2	For simplicity, biochemists tend to use a modified representation of the ionization of water: H2O &#x2192; H+ + OH&#8211;
7.2.0.0.3.1	The ionization of water is important to all living creatures.
7.2.0.0.3.2	This fact may seem surprising, since only about 1 water molecule in 500 million is ionized at any given time.
7.2.0.0.3.3	But this is less surprising if we focus on the abundance of water in living systems, and the reactive nature of the H+ ions produced by ionization.
7.2.0.0.1.1	As we have seen, compounds can be either acids or bases, and thus solutions can be either acidic or basic.
7.2.0.0.1.2	We can measure how acidic or basic a solution is by measuring its concentration of H+ in moles per liter (its molarity; see p. xx).
7.2.0.0.1.3	Here are some examples:
7.2.0.0.2.1	Pure water has a H+ concentration of 10&#8211;7 M.
7.2.0.0.3.1	A 1 M HCl solution has a H+ concentration of 1 M (recall that all the HCl dissociates into its ions).
7.2.0.0.4.1	A 1 M NaOH solution has a H+ concentration of 10&#8211;14 M.
7.2.0.0.5.1	This is a very wide range of numbers to work with&#8212;think about the decimals!
7.2.0.0.5.2	It is easier to work with the logarithm of the H+ concentration, because logarithms compress this range: the log10 of 100, for example, is 2; and the log10 of 0.01 is &#8211;2.
7.2.0.0.5.3	Because most H+ concentrations in living systems are less than 1 M, their log10 values are negative.
7.2.0.0.5.4	For convenience, we convert these negative numbers into positive ones by using the negative of the logarithm of the H+ molar concentration.
7.2.0.0.5.5	This number is called the pH of the solution: pH = &#8211;log(H+) where (H+) is the concentration of free H+ in solution
7.2.0.0.6.1	Since the H+ concentration of pure water is 10&#8211;7 M, its pH is &#8211;log(10&#8211;7) = &#8211;(&#8211;7), or 7.
7.2.0.0.6.2	A smaller negative logarithm means a larger number.
7.2.0.0.6.3	In practical terms, a lower pH means a higher H+ concentration, or greater acidity.
7.2.0.0.6.4	In 1 M HCl, the H+ concentration is 1 M, so the pH is the negative logarithm of 1 (&#8211;log 100), or 0.
7.2.0.0.6.5	The pH of 1 M NaOH is the negative logarithm of 10&#8211;14, or 14.
7.2.0.0.7.1	A solution with a pH of less than 7 is acidic&#8212;it contains more H+ ions than OH&#8211; ions.
7.2.0.0.7.2	A solution with a pH of 7 is referred to as neutral, and a solution with a pH value greater than 7 is basic.
7.2.0.0.7.3	Figure 2.15 shows the pH values of some common substances.
7.2.0.0.7.4	Figure 2.15 pH Values of Some Familiar Substances
7.2.0.0.8.1	Why is this discussion of pH so relevant to biology?
7.2.0.0.8.2	Many reactions involve the transfer of an ion or charged group from one molecule to another, and the presence of positive or negative ions in the environment can greatly influence the rates of such reactions.
7.2.0.0.8.3	Furthermore, pH can influence the shapes of molecules.
7.2.0.0.8.4	Many biologically important molecules contain charged groups (e. g. , &#8212;COO&#8211;) that can interact with the polar regions of water, and these interactions influence the way such molecules fold up into three-dimensional shapes.
7.2.0.0.8.5	If these charged groups combine with H+ or other ions in their environment to form uncharged groups (e. g. , &#8212;COOH; see above), they will have a reduced tendency to interact with water.
7.2.0.0.8.6	These uncharged (hydrophobic) groups might induce the molecule to fold up differently so that they are no longer in contact with the watery environment.
7.2.0.0.8.7	Since the three-dimensional structures of biological molecules greatly affect the way they function, organisms do all they can to minimize changes in the pH of their cells and tissues.
7.2.0.0.8.8	An important way to do this is with buffers.
7.2.0.0.1.1	The maintenance of internal constancy&#8212;homeostasis&#8212;is a hallmark of all living things and extends to pH.
7.2.0.0.1.2	If biological molecules lose or gain H+ ions, their properties can change, thus upsetting homeostasis.
7.2.0.0.1.3	For example, people who exercise strenuously produce lactic acid, which ionizes to produce H+.
7.2.0.0.1.4	Internal constancy within tissues can be achieved with buffers: solutions that maintain a relatively constant pH even when substantial amounts of acid or base are added.
7.2.0.0.1.5	How does this work?
7.2.0.0.2.1	A buffer is a mixture of a weak acid and its corresponding base, or a weak base and its corresponding acid.
7.2.0.0.2.2	For example, a weak acid is carbonic acid (H2CO3), and its corresponding base is the bicarbonate ion (HCO3&#8211;).
7.2.0.0.2.3	If another acid is added to a solution containing this mixture (a buffered solution), not all the H+ ions from the acid remain in solution.
7.2.0.0.2.4	Instead, many of them combine with the bicarbonate ions to produce more carbonic acid: HCO3&#8211; + H+  &#x21CC;  H2CO3 Figure 2.16 Buffers Minimize Changes in pH
7.2.0.0.3.1	This reaction uses up some of the H+ ions in the solution and decreases the acidifying effect of the added acid.
7.2.0.0.3.2	If a base is added, the reaction essentially reverses.
7.2.0.0.3.3	Some of the carbonic acid ionizes to produce bicarbonate ions and more H+, which counteracts some of the added base.
7.2.0.0.3.4	The buffer minimizes the effect that an added acid or base has on pH.
7.2.0.0.3.5	The carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffering system is present in the blood, where it is important for preventing significant changes in pH that could disrupt the ability of the blood to carry vital oxygen to tissues.
7.2.0.0.3.6	A given amount of acid or base causes a smaller pH change in a buffered solution than in a non-buffered one (Figure 2.16).
7.2.0.0.4.1	Buffers illustrate an important chemical principle of reversible reactions, called the law of mass action.
7.2.0.0.4.2	Addition of a reactant on one side of a reversible system drives the reaction in the direction that uses up that compound.
7.2.0.0.4.3	In the case of buffers, addition of an acid drives the reaction in one direction; addition of a base drives the reaction in the other direction.
7.2.0.0.5.1	You may occasionally use a buffer to relieve indigestion.
7.2.0.0.5.2	The lining of the stomach constantly secretes hydrochloric acid, making the stomach contents acidic.
7.2.0.0.5.3	But excessive stomach acid can cause discomfort.
7.2.0.0.5.4	We can relieve this discomfort by ingesting a salt such as NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate), which acts as a buffer.
7.2.0.0.6.1	investigatinglife
7.2.0.0.7.1	What insights into biological systems have been discovered through isotope analysis?
7.2.0.0.8.1	The opening investigation of dinosaurs (oxygen atoms) and the investigating life experiment of hamburgers (carbon atoms) are examples of identifying the life history of organisms through isotopic analysis.
7.2.0.0.8.2	Recently, this has been applied to humans as well.
7.2.0.0.8.3	Hair is a living tissue, with a lot of O and H atoms derived from water in the diet.
7.2.0.0.8.4	Ecologist Jim Ehleringer and chemist Thure Cerling have shown that like the dinosaurs, the isotopic ratios of O and H in hair reflect the geographical region where a person drank the water.
7.2.0.0.8.5	This can be useful evidence in a forensic investigation, placing a person at a location.
7.2.0.0.8.6	Isotopic ratios are also used to identify where plants are grown, because their tissues also have unique ratios.
7.2.0.0.8.7	For example, ratios have revealed the geographical origin of poppies used to make heroin.
7.2.0.0.8.8	The mass spectrometer, a chemical analysis instrument that detects isotopes, is fast becoming an important tool for biologists.
7.2.0.0.9.1	Future directions
7.2.0.0.10.1	Tracking the isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in precipitation is useful in understanding patterns of climate change.
7.2.0.0.10.2	Water evaporates in warmer regions at the tropical latitudes on Earth and moves toward the cooler poles.
7.2.0.0.10.3	As an air mass moves from a warmer to a cooler region, water vapor condenses and is removed as precipitation.
7.2.0.0.10.4	The heavy isotopes of H and O tend to fall as precipitation more readily than the lighter isotopes, so as the water vapor moves toward the poles, it becomes enriched in the lighter isotopes.
7.2.0.0.10.5	The ratio of heavy to light isotopes that reach the poles depends on the climate&#8211;the cooler the climate, the lower the ratio, because more water precipitates as it moves toward the poles, depleting more of the heavier isotopes.
7.2.0.0.10.6	Analyses of polar ice cores show that heavy-to-light isotope ratios vary over geological time scales.
7.2.0.0.10.7	This has allowed scientists to reconstruct climate change in the past, and to relate it to fossil organisms that lived at those times.
7.2.0.0.10.8	Isotope ratios may be useful in monitoring climate change that is happening today.
7.2.0.0.11.1	2.4 recap
7.2.0.0.12.1	Most of the chemistry of life occurs in water, which has unique properties that make it an ideal medium for supporting life.
7.2.0.0.12.2	These properties include hydrogen bonding between molecules, high specific heat, and cohesion between molecules.
7.2.0.0.12.3	Aqueous solutions can be acidic or basic, depending on the concentration of hydrogen ions.
7.2.0.0.12.4	The cells and tissues of organisms are buffered, however, because changes in pH can change the properties of biological molecules.

7.2.summary.7.1	In losing, gaining, or sharing electrons to become more stable, an atom can combine with other atoms to form a molecule. 2.2
7.2.summary.8.1	Atoms Bond to Form Molecules
7.2.summary.9.1	A chemical bond is an attractive force that links two atoms together in a molecule.
7.2.summary.9.2	Review Table 2.1, Animation 2.1
7.2.summary.10.1	A compound is a substance made up of molecules with two or more different atoms bonded together in a fixed ratio, such as water (H2O).
7.2.summary.11.1	Covalent bonds are strong bonds formed when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons.
7.2.summary.11.2	Review Focus: Key Figure 2.4, Figure 2.5
7.2.summary.12.1	When two atoms of unequal electronegativity bond with each other, a polar covalent bond is formed.
7.2.summary.12.2	The two ends, or poles, of the bond have partial charges (  + or   &#8211;).
7.2.summary.12.3	Review Figure 2.7
7.2.summary.13.1	An ion is an electrically charged particle that forms when an atom gains or loses one or more electrons in order to form a more stable electron configuration.
7.2.summary.13.2	Anions and cations are negatively and positively charged ions, respectively.
7.2.summary.13.3	Different charges attract each other, and like charges repel each other.
7.2.summary.14.1	Ionic attractions occur between oppositely charged ions.
7.2.summary.14.2	Ionic attractions are strong in solids (salts) but weaken when the ions are separated from one another in solution.
7.2.summary.14.3	Review Figure 2.9
7.2.summary.15.1	A hydrogen bond is a weak electrical attraction that forms between a   + hydrogen atom in one molecule and a   &#8211; atom in another molecule (or in another part of the same, large molecule).
7.2.summary.15.2	Hydrogen bonds are abundant in water.
7.2.summary.15.3	Review Figure 2.10
7.2.summary.16.1	Nonpolar molecules interact very little with polar molecules, including water.
7.2.summary.16.2	Nonpolar molecules are attracted to one another by very weak bonds called van der Waals forces. 2.3
7.2.summary.17.1	Atoms Change Partners in Chemical Reactions
7.2.summary.18.1	In chemical reactions, atoms combine or change their bonding partners.
7.2.summary.18.2	Reactants are converted into products.
7.2.summary.19.1	Some chemical reactions release energy as one of their products; other reactions can occur only if energy is provided to the reactants.
7.2.summary.20.1	Neither matter nor energy is created or destroyed in a chemical reaction, but both change form.
7.2.summary.20.2	Review Figure 2.12
7.2.summary.21.1	In organisms, chemical reactions take place in multiple steps so that released energy can be harvested for cellular activities. 2.4
7.2.summary.22.1	Water Is Critical for Life
7.2.summary.23.1	Water   s molecular structure and its capacity to form hydrogen bonds give it unique properties that are significant for life.
7.2.summary.23.2	Review Figure 2.13
7.2.summary.24.1	The high specific heat of water means that water gains or loses a great deal of heat when it changes state.
7.2.summary.24.2	Water   s high heat of vaporization ensures effective cooling when water evaporates.
7.2.summary.25.1	The cohesion of water molecules refers to their capacity to resist coming apart from one another.
7.2.summary.25.2	Hydrogen bonding between the water molecules plays an essential role in this property.

7.2.summary.29.1	Review
7.2.summary.30.1	2.4 The acid-base properties of water and other compounds in cells allow reversible changes that affect biological functions.
7.2.summary.31.1	Scientists are developing methods to sample a person&#8217;s breath and test it for higher-than-normal levels of compounds that contain ketones.
7.2.summary.31.2	The buildup of these compounds in the body can indicate type I diabetes.
7.2.summary.31.3	This work could lead to development of a portable device that will allow earlier diagnosis of diabetes, especially in children.
7.2.summary.32.1	Insulin is a hormone that stimulates cells in the body to take up glucose from the blood.
7.2.summary.32.2	Cells use glucose as a source of energy for normal cell function.
7.2.summary.32.3	In type I diabetes, insulin is not produced, and glucose does not enter cells from the blood.
7.2.summary.32.4	Lacking an incoming supply of glucose, cells begin breaking down fats as a source of energy.
7.2.summary.32.5	When fats break down, several ketone-containing compounds are produced and they can be detected by a breath analysis device.
7.2.summary.32.6	A ketone has the general structure RCOR', where R and R' are the same or different groups of atoms.
7.2.summary.33.1	One of the ketone-containing products of fat breakdown is acetoacetic acid, which has the structure below.
7.2.summary.33.2	Acetoacetic acid is very harmful when it builds up in high concentration in the body.
7.2.summary.34.1	Questions
7.2.summary.35.1	1.
7.2.summary.35.2	In water, acetoacetic acid can ionize to form protons and acetoacetate ions.
7.2.summary.35.3	Write the chemical structures for this reaction.
7.2.summary.36.1	2.
7.2.summary.36.2	Now write out the reversible chemical reaction for the ionization of carbonic acid in blood, which can act as a buffer.
7.2.summary.36.3	Would the pH of blood change if a small amount of acetoacetic acid produced normally in tissues were added to the blood?
7.2.summary.36.4	Explain.
7.2.summary.37.1	3.
7.2.summary.37.2	What would happen to the pH of the blood if more and more acetoacetic acid built up, as in a case of untreated diabetes?
7.2.summary.37.3	Explain, using what you found in Question 2 above.
7.2.summary.37.4	What would happen to the body&#8217;s ability to maintain a constant blood pH?
7.2.summary.37.5	How does this explain why people with this condition become severely ill?
7.2.summary.38.1	4.
7.2.summary.38.2	Acetone is one of the compounds produced from fat breakdown and expelled in the breath.
7.2.summary.38.3	It is targeted for detection by a breath-analysis device.
7.2.summary.38.4	Its chemical structure is shown below.
7.2.summary.38.5	Analyze the structure to determine whether it would be expected to affect the carbonic acid or bicarbonate buffer system in the blood.
7.2.summary.39.1	5.
7.2.summary.39.2	Suppose scientists succeed in developing a device that detects ketone buildup in the breath.
7.2.summary.39.3	If a person tested positive for higher-than-normal ketones with the breath test, what are some blood tests that could be done to follow up?
7.2.summary.39.4	Suggest three or four different blood tests, other than acetoacetic acid or ketone levels, that could be used to detect the existence of insulin insufficiency.

7.3.8.1	Weaving a Web
7.3.9.1	A spider web is an amazing structure.
7.3.9.2	It is not only beautiful to look at, but an architectural wonder serving as the spider   s home, its mating place, and its way to capture food.
7.3.9.3	Consider a fly that chances to interact with a spider web.
7.3.9.4	The fibers of the web must slow down the fly, but they cannot break, so they need to stretch to dissipate the energy of the fly   s movement.
7.3.9.5	The fibers holding the fly cannot stretch too much; they must be strong enough to hold the web in place.
7.3.9.6	Web fibers are far thinner than a human hair, yet they are very strong.
7.3.9.7	The fibers can also be long; for example, the Darwin   s bark spider makes strands up to 25 meters long.
7.3.10.1	Chemical investigations reveal that spider silk is made of variations on a single type of large molecule called a protein.
7.3.10.2	Proteins are polymers: long chains of individual smaller units called amino acids.
7.3.10.3	The proteins in spider silks have characteristic structures and amino acid compositions that determine particular functions.
7.3.10.4	Proteins in the stretchy web fibers have amino acids that allow them to curl into spirals, and these spirals can slip along one another to change the fiber   s length.
7.3.10.5	Another kind of spider silk is the dragline silk, which is less stretchy and used to construct the outline of the web, its spokes, and the lifeline of the spider.
7.3.10.6	The proteins in these strong fibers are made up of amino acids that cause the proteins to fold into flat sheets with ratchets, so that parallel sheets can fit together like Lego blocks.
7.3.10.7	This arrangement makes these fibers hard to pull apart.
7.3.11.1	Just how strong is spider silk?
7.3.11.2	A popular series of films features the fictional character Spider-Man.
7.3.11.3	He often uses his web to ensnare evildoers and protect the innocent.
7.3.11.4	In one scene, he stops a train by using ten ropes made of spider silk, each about 1 centimeter thick.
7.3.11.5	Scientists who study spider silk have estimated the number of silk fibers in each rope and calculated that this scene would indeed be possible.
7.3.11.6	All of this from covalent bonds holding long chains of amino acids together and weaker forces between the chains!
7.3.11.7	Given the amazing strength shown by these proteins, it is not surprising that there is a lot of interest in using spider silk for human activities.
7.3.12.1	What are practical uses for spider silk?
7.3.13.1	Chapter 3 continues with
7.3.14.1	3.1  Macromolecules Characterize Living Things
7.3.1.1.1	Chemical groupings determine the structures of macromolecules
7.3.1.2.1	The structures of macromolecules reflect their functions
7.3.1.3.1	Most macromolecules are formed by condensation and broken down by hydrolysis
7.3.1.4.1	Four kinds of molecules are characteristic of living things: proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids.
7.3.1.4.2	With the exception of the lipids, these biological molecules are polymers (poly,    many,  ? + mer,    unit  ?) constructed by the covalent bonding of smaller molecules called monomers.
7.3.1.4.3	Each kind of biological molecule is made up of monomers with similar chemical structures:
7.3.1.5.1	Proteins are formed from different combinations of 20 amino acids, all of which share chemical similarities.
7.3.1.6.1	Carbohydrates can form giant molecules by linking together chemically similar sugar monomers (monosaccharides) to form polysaccharides.
7.3.1.7.1	Nucleic acids are formed from four kinds of nucleotide monomers linked together in long chains.
7.3.1.8.1	Lipids also form large structures from a limited set of smaller molecules, but in this case noncovalent forces maintain the interactions between the lipid monomers that are held together by covalent bonds.
7.3.1.9.1	Polymers containing thousands or more atoms are called macromolecules.
7.3.1.9.2	The proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids of living systems certainly fall into this category.
7.3.1.9.3	Although large lipid structures are not polymers in the strictest sense, it is convenient to treat them as macromolecules (see Key Concept 3.4).
7.3.1.9.4	Green plants have the living world   s most abundant protein (rubisco; see Chapter 10), most abundant carbohydrate (cellulose in plant cell walls), and most abundant lipid (monogalactosyl diglyceride in leaves).
7.3.1.10.1	focus your learning
7.3.1.11.1	Isomers are molecules having the same composition but different structures.
7.3.1.12.1	Monomers are chemically linked via condensation reactions to form polymers.
7.3.1.1.1.1	Certain small groups of atoms, called functional groups, occur frequently in biological molecules (Figure 3.1).
7.3.1.1.1.2	Each functional group has specific chemical properties, and when it is attached to a larger molecule, it confers those properties on the larger molecule.
7.3.1.1.1.3	One of these properties is polarity.
7.3.1.1.1.4	Looking at the structures in Figure 3.1, can you determine which functional groups are the most polar?
7.3.1.1.1.5	(Hint: look for C   O, N   H, and P   O bonds. )
7.3.1.1.1.6	The consistent chemical behavior of functional groups helps us understand the properties of the molecules that contain them.
7.3.1.1.2.1	Figure 3.1 Some Functional Groups Important to Living Systems
7.3.1.1.3.1	Some Functional Groups Important to Living Systems Highlighted here are the eight functional groups most commonly found in biologically important molecules.
7.3.1.1.3.2	R  ? is a variable chemical grouping.
7.3.1.1.4.1	Macromolecules have many different functional groups.
7.3.1.1.4.2	A single large protein may contain nonpolar, polar, and charged functional groups, each of which gives different specific properties to local sites on the macromolecule.
7.3.1.1.4.3	As we will see, sometimes these different groups interact within the same macromolecule.
7.3.1.1.4.4	They help determine the shape of the macromolecule as well as how it interacts with other macromolecules and with smaller molecules.
7.3.1.1.5.1	Using the same atoms, molecules can differ from one another because their functional groups can be arranged differently.
7.3.1.1.5.2	Isomers are molecules that have the same (   iso  ?) chemical formula   the same kinds and numbers of atoms   but with the atoms arranged differently.
7.3.1.1.5.3	Of the different kinds of isomers, we will consider three: structural isomers, cis-trans isomers, and optical isomers.
7.3.1.1.6.1	Structural isomers differ in how their atoms are joined together.
7.3.1.1.6.2	Consider two simple molecules, each composed of four carbon and ten hydrogen atoms bonded covalently, both with the formula C4H10.
7.3.1.1.6.3	These atoms can be linked in two different ways, resulting in different molecules (Figure 3.2A).
7.3.1.1.7.1	cis-trans isomers typically involve a double bond between two carbon atoms, where the carbons share two pairs of electrons.
7.3.1.1.7.2	When the remaining two bonds of each of these carbons are to two different atoms or groups of atoms (e. g. , a hydrogen and a methyl group; Figure 3.2B), these can be oriented on the same side or different sides of the doublebonded molecule.
7.3.1.1.7.3	If the different atoms or groups of atoms are on the same side, the double bond is called cis; if they are on opposite sides, the bond is trans.
7.3.1.1.7.4	These molecules can have very different properties.
7.3.1.1.8.1	Optical isomers occur when a carbon atom has four different atoms or groups of atoms attached to it.
7.3.1.1.8.2	This pattern allows for two different ways of making the attachments, each the mirror image of the other (Figure 3.2C).
7.3.1.1.8.3	Such a carbon atom is called an asymmetric carbon, and the two resulting molecules are optical isomers of one another.
7.3.1.1.8.4	You can envision your right and left hands as optical isomers.
7.3.1.1.8.5	Just as a glove is specific for a particular hand, some biochemical molecules that can interact with one optical isomer of a carbon compound are unable to    fit  ? the other.
7.3.1.1.9.1	Figure 3.2  Isomers
7.3.1.1.10.1	Isomers have the same chemical formula, but the atoms are arranged differently.
7.3.1.1.10.2	Pairs of isomers often have different chemical properties and functions.
7.3.1.2.1.1	The four kinds of biological macromolecules are present in roughly the same proportions in all living organisms (Figure 3.3).
7.3.1.2.1.2	Also, a protein that has a certain structure, and therefore function, in an apple tree probably has a similar structure and function in a human being, because the protein   s chemistry is the same wherever it is found.
7.3.1.2.1.3	This impressive biochemical unity reflects the evolution of all life from a common ancestor, by descent with modification.
7.3.1.2.1.4	An important advantage of biochemical unity is that some organisms can acquire needed raw materials by eating other organisms.
7.3.1.2.1.5	When you eat an apple, the molecules you take in include carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins that can be broken down and rebuilt into the varieties of those molecules needed by humans.
7.3.1.2.1.6	Figure 3.3  Substances Found in Living Tissues
7.3.1.2.2.1	Each kind of macromolecule performs one or more functions such as energy storage, structural support, catalysis (speeding up of chemical reactions), transport of other molecules, regulation of other molecules, defense, movement, or information storage.
7.3.1.2.2.2	These roles are not necessarily exclusive; for example, both carbohydrates and proteins can play structural roles, supporting and protecting tissues and organs.
7.3.1.2.2.3	However, only the nucleic acids specialize in information storage and transmission.
7.3.1.2.2.4	These macromolecules function as hereditary material, carrying the traits of both species and individuals from generation to generation.

7.3.1.2.7.1	Spider silk is one of the strongest materials known, but it is very hard to harvest in quantity.
7.3.1.2.7.2	Industrial biologists are therefore using genetic engineering to produce the protein fibers.
7.3.1.2.7.3	The scientists have coaxed silkworms, insect larvae that make silk fibers used in clothing, to make a much stronger composite of silkworm and spider silk.
7.3.1.2.8.1	HYPOTHESIS  Genetically engineered silkworms can produce silk with physical properties like those of silk made by spiders.
7.3.1.2.9.1	METHOD
7.3.1.2.10.1	RESULTS
7.3.1.2.11.1	Both silks had identical physical properties of stress (force needed to break) and strain (stretching).
7.3.1.2.12.1	CONCLUSION   Silkworms can make composite silk fiber with the same properties as those of the native spider silk protein.
7.3.1.2.13.1	work with the data
7.3.1.2.14.1	Spider silk is a protein-based material that is very strong because of its secondary structure.
7.3.1.2.14.2	Because of its potential uses by humans, it is desirable to obtain large amounts of these fibers.
7.3.1.2.14.3	Spiders spin out the silk fibers for their web, but the amounts are insufficient for human use.
7.3.1.2.14.4	Silkworms make abundant silk fibers that are used in textiles but are much weaker than spider silk.
7.3.1.2.14.5	An international team of scientists led by Randy Lewis at the University of Wyoming genetically engineered silkworms to make composite silkworm&#x2013;spider silk fibers in large quantities.
7.3.1.2.14.6	They then tested the properties of these fibers and compared them with those of native spider silk.
7.3.1.2.15.1	QUESTIONS
7.3.1.2.16.1	To evaluate the properties of the protein fibers, researchers stretched them and measured the forces involved as well as the resulting lengthening of the fibers.
7.3.1.2.16.2	You can liken this to stretching a rubber band until it breaks.
7.3.1.2.16.3	Stress is the force required to break the fiber; it is measured in millipascals (mPa; 1 Pa is the force in newtons per unit area in m2).
7.3.1.2.16.4	Strain is a measure of how much the fiber lengthens (as a percentage of its original length).
7.3.1.2.16.5	Table A compares the results from silk from spiders and from genetically engineered silkworms.
7.3.1.2.16.6	Did the genetically engineered silkworms make fibers that were similar to native spider silk?
7.3.1.2.17.1	Why was thickness (diameter) reported in the data?
7.3.1.2.18.1	What statistical test would you perform to determine if the measured properties were significantly different (see Appendix B)?
7.3.1.2.19.1	The scientists measured the properties composite of spider silk compared with those of Kevlar (a synthetic fiber with many uses, including in bicycle tires, racing sails, and body armor) and steel.
7.3.1.2.19.2	The results are shown in Table B. What can you conclude about the spider silk?

7.3.1.2.22.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.3.1.2.23.1	The sequence and chemical properties of the chain of monomers in a macromolecule determine its three-dimensional shape and function.
7.3.1.2.23.2	Some macromolecules fold into compact forms with surface features that make them water-soluble and capable of intimate interactions with other molecules.
7.3.1.2.23.3	Some proteins and carbohydrates form long, fibrous structures (such as those found in spider silk or hair) that provide strength and rigidity.
7.3.1.2.23.4	The specific structure of a macromolecule determines its function in a given environment, regardless of its origin.
7.3.1.2.23.5	For example, composite spider silk fiber made by another organism (e. g. , the silkworm, a moth larva) has the same properties as spider silk made by a spider (Investigating Life: Making Spider Silk).
7.3.1.3.1.1	Figure 3.4 Condensation and Hydrolysis of Polymers
7.3.1.3.2.1	Polymers are formed from monomers by a series of condensation reactions (in this case called dehydration reactions; both terms refer to the loss of water).
7.3.1.3.2.2	Condensation reactions result in the formation of covalent bonds between monomers.
7.3.1.3.2.3	A molecule of water is released with each covalent bond formed (Figure 3.4A).
7.3.1.3.2.4	The condensation reactions that produce the different kinds of polymers differ in detail, but in all cases polymers form only if water molecules are removed and energy is added to the system.
7.3.1.3.2.5	In living systems, specific energy-rich molecules supply the necessary energy.
7.3.1.3.3.1	The reverse of a condensation reaction is a hydrolysis reaction (hydro    water,  ? + lysis,    break  ?).
7.3.1.3.3.2	Hydrolysis reactions result in the breakdown of polymers into their component monomers.
7.3.1.3.3.3	Water reacts with the covalent bonds that link the polymer together.
7.3.1.3.3.4	For each covalent bond that is broken, a water molecule splits into two ions (H+ and OH-), each of which becomes part of one of the products (Figure 3.4B).
7.3.1.3.4.1	3.1 recap
7.3.1.3.5.1	The four kinds of large molecules that distinguish living tissues are proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids.
7.3.1.3.5.2	Most are polymers: chains of linked monomers.
7.3.1.3.5.3	Very large polymers are called macromolecules.
7.3.1.3.5.4	Biological molecules carry out a variety of life-sustaining functions.

7.3.1.3.14.2	We will cover the unique properties of the nucleic acids in Chapter 4.
7.3.1.3.14.3	The remainder of this chapter will describe the structures and functions of the proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids.
7.3.1.3.15.1	Chapter 3 continues with
7.3.1.3.16.1	3.2 The Function of a Protein Depends on Its Three-Dimensional Structure
7.3.2.1.1	Monomers of proteins link together to make the macromolecule
7.3.2.2.1	Peptide linkages form the backbone of a protein
7.3.2.3.1	The primary structure of a protein is its amino acid sequence

7.3.2.10.1	Environmental conditions affect protein structure
7.3.2.11.1	Protein shapes can change
7.3.2.12.1	Molecular chaperones help shape proteins
7.3.2.13.1	Proteins have very diverse roles.
7.3.2.13.2	You   ll learn about the many functions of proteins (Table 3.1) in virtually every chapter of this book.
7.3.2.13.3	Proteins are polymers made up of 20 amino acids in different proportions and sequences.
7.3.2.13.4	Proteins range in size, from small ones such as the human hormone insulin, which has 51 amino acids and a molecular weight of 5,733, to huge molecules such as the muscle protein titin, with 26,926 amino acids and a molecular weight of 2,993,451.
7.3.2.13.5	Proteins consist of one or more polypeptide chains&#x2014;unbranched (linear) polymers of covalently linked amino acids.
7.3.2.13.6	Variation in the sequences of amino acids in the polypeptide chains allows for the vast diversity in protein structure and function.
7.3.2.13.7	Each chain folds into a particular three-dimensional shape that is specified by the sequence of amino acids present in the chain.

7.3.2.15.1	focus your learning
7.3.2.16.1	A protein   s tertiary structure describes its three-dimensional shape and is stabilized by hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, ionic attractions, and in some proteins, disulfide bonds.
7.3.2.17.1	Exposed surface groups on a protein provide both shapes and chemical groups that can interact specifically with other molecules or ions.
7.3.2.18.1	The forces that stabilize a protein   s secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures make the protein vulnerable to disruption by environmental factors.
7.3.2.1.1.1	Each amino acid has both a carboxyl functional group and an amino functional group (see Figure 3.1) attached to the same carbon atom, called the    (alpha) carbon.
7.3.2.1.1.2	Also attached to the    carbon atom are a hydrogen atom and a side chain, or R group, designated by the letter R.
7.3.2.1.2.1	The    carbon in this example is asymmetrical because it is bonded to four different atoms or groups of atoms.
7.3.2.1.2.2	Therefore amino acids can exist as optical isomers called D-amino acids and L-amino acids.
7.3.2.1.2.3	D and L are abbreviations of the Latin terms for right (dextro) and left (levo).
7.3.2.1.2.4	Only L-amino acids (with the configuration shown above) are commonly found in the proteins of most organisms, and their presence is an important chemical    signature  ? of life.
7.3.2.1.3.1	At the pH levels typically found in cells (usually about pH 7), both the carboxyl and amino groups of amino acids are ionized: the carboxyl group has lost a hydrogen ion: COOH        COO    + H+
7.3.2.1.4.1	and the amino group has gained a hydrogen ion: NH2 + H+        NH3+
7.3.2.1.5.1	Thus amino acids are simultaneously acids and bases.
7.3.2.1.6.1	The side chains (or R groups) of amino acids contain functional groups that are important in determining the three-dimensional structure and thus the function of the protein.
7.3.2.1.6.2	As Table 3.2 shows, the 20 amino acids found in living organisms are grouped and distinguished by their side chains:
7.3.2.1.7.1	table 3.2 The Twenty Amino Acids
7.3.2.1.8.1	Five amino acids have electrically charged (ionized) side chains at pH levels typical of living cells.
7.3.2.1.8.2	These side chains attract water (are hydrophilic) and attract oppositely charged ions of all sorts.
7.3.2.1.9.1	Five amino acids have polar side chains.
7.3.2.1.9.2	They are also hydrophilic and attract other polar or charged molecules.
7.3.2.1.10.1	Seven amino acids have side chains that are nonpolar and thus hydrophobic.
7.3.2.1.10.2	In the watery environment of the cell, these hydrophobic groups may cluster together in the interior of the protein.
7.3.2.1.11.1	Three amino acids   cysteine, glycine, and proline   are special cases, although the side chains of the latter two are generally hydrophobic.
7.3.2.1.12.1	The cysteine side chain, which has a terminal    SH group, can react with another cysteine side chain in an oxidation reaction to form a covalent bond (Figure 3.5).
7.3.2.1.12.2	Such a bond, called a disulfide bridge or disulfide bond (   S   S   ), helps determine how a polypeptide chain folds.
7.3.2.1.13.1	The glycine side chain consists of a single hydrogen atom.
7.3.2.1.13.2	It is small enough to fit into tight corners in the interiors of protein molecules where larger side chains could not fit.
7.3.2.1.14.1	Proline possesses a modified amino group that lacks a hydrogen atom and instead forms a covalent bond with the hydrocarbon side chain, resulting in a ring structure.
7.3.2.1.14.2	This limits both its hydrogen-bonding ability and its ability to rotate around the    carbon.
7.3.2.1.14.3	So proline is often found where a protein bends or loops.
7.3.2.1.15.1	Figure 3.5  A Disulfide Bridge
7.3.2.1.16.1	Two cysteine molecules in a polypeptide chain can form a disulfide bridge (   S   S   ) by oxidation (removal of H atoms).
7.3.2.2.1.1	Linking amino acids involves a reaction between carboxyl and amino groups attached to the    carbon.
7.3.2.2.1.2	The carboxyl group of one amino acid reacts with the amino group of another, undergoing a condensation reaction that forms a peptide linkage (also called a peptide bond).
7.3.2.2.1.3	Figure 3.6 depicts this reaction.
7.3.2.2.1.4	Figure 3.6  Formation of Peptide Linkages
7.3.2.2.2.1	Just as a sentence begins with a capital letter and ends with a period, polypeptide chains have a beginning and an end.
7.3.2.2.2.2	The    capital letter  ? marking the beginning of a polypeptide is the amino group of the first amino acid added to the chain and is known as the N terminus.
7.3.2.2.2.3	The    period  ? is the carboxyl group of the last amino acid added; this is the C terminus.
7.3.2.2.3.1	Two characteristics of the peptide bond are especially important in the three-dimensional structures of proteins:
7.3.2.2.4.1	In the C   N linkage, the adjacent    carbons (   C   C   N      C) are not free to rotate fully, which limits the folding of the polypeptide chain.
7.3.2.2.5.1	The oxygen bound to the carbon (C==O) in the carboxyl group carries a slight negative charge (     ), whereas the hydrogen bound to the nitrogen (N   H) in the amino group is slightly positive (  +).
7.3.2.2.5.2	This asymmetry of charge favors hydrogen bonding within the protein molecule itself and between molecules.
7.3.2.2.5.3	These bonds contribute to the structures and functions of many proteins.
7.3.2.2.6.1	In addition to these characteristics of the peptide linkage, the particular sequence of amino acids   with their various R groups   in the polypeptide chain also plays a vital role in determining a protein   s structure (Focus Key Figure 3.7A) and function.
7.3.2.2.7.1	focus: key figure
7.3.2.2.8.1	Figure 3.7 The Four Levels of Protein Structure
7.3.2.2.9.1	Secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure all arise from the primary structure of the protein.
7.3.2.2.10.1	Q: If a protein is gently heated to break hydrogen bonds, what level(s) of structure will be unaffected, and why?
7.3.2.3.1.1	The precise sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain held together by peptide bonds constitutes the primary structure of a protein (see Figure 3.7A).
7.3.2.3.1.2	The backbone of the polypeptide chain consists of the repeating sequence    N   C   C    made up of the N atom from the amino group, the    C atom, and the C atom from the carboxyl group in each amino acid.
7.3.2.3.2.1	The single-letter abbreviations for amino acids (see Table 3.2) are used to record the amino acid sequence of a protein.
7.3.2.3.2.2	Here, for example, are the first 20 amino acids (out of a total of 124) in the protein ribonuclease from a cow: KETAAAKFERQHMDSSTSAA
7.3.2.3.3.1	The theoretical number of different proteins is enormous.
7.3.2.3.3.2	Since there are 20 different amino acids, there could be 20    20 = 400 distinct dipeptides (two linked amino acids) and 20    20    20 = 8,000 different tripeptides (three linked amino acids).
7.3.2.3.3.3	Imagine this process of multiplying by 20 extended to a protein made up of 100 amino acids (which would be considered a small protein).
7.3.2.3.3.4	There could be 20100 (that   s approximately 10130) such small proteins, each with its own distinctive primary structure.
7.3.2.3.3.5	How large is the number 20100?
7.3.2.3.3.6	Physicists tell us there aren   t that many electrons in the entire universe!
7.3.2.3.4.1	The sequence of amino acids in the polypeptide chain determines its final shape.
7.3.2.3.4.2	The properties associated with each functional group in the side chains of the amino acids (see Table 3.2) determine how the protein can twist and fold, thus adopting a specific stable structure that distinguishes it from every other protein.
7.3.2.4.1.1	A protein   s secondary structure consists of regular, repeated spatial patterns in different regions of a polypeptide chain.
7.3.2.4.1.2	There are two basic types of secondary structure, both determined by hydrogen bonding between the amino acids that make up the primary structure: the    helix and the    pleated sheet.
7.3.2.4.2.1.1	Figure 3.8  Left- and Right-Handed Helices
7.3.2.4.2.2.1	The    (alpha) helix is a right-handed coil that turns in the same direction as a standard wood screw (see Figure 3.7B and Figure 3.8).
7.3.2.4.2.2.2	The R groups extend outward from the peptide backbone of the helix.
7.3.2.4.2.2.3	The coiling results from hydrogen bonds that form between the   + hydrogen of the N   H of one amino acid and the       oxygen of the C==O of another.
7.3.2.4.2.2.4	When this pattern of hydrogen bonding is established repeatedly over a segment of the protein, it stabilizes the coil.
7.3.2.4.3.1.1	A    (beta) pleated sheet is formed from two or more polypeptide chains that are almost completely extended and aligned.
7.3.2.4.3.1.2	The sheet is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the N   H groups on one chain and the C==O groups on the other (see Figure 3.7B).
7.3.2.4.3.1.3	A    pleated sheet may form between separate polypeptide chains or between different regions of a single polypeptide chain that is bent back on itself.
7.3.2.4.3.1.4	The ratcheted, stacked sheets in dragline spider silks (described at the beginning of the chapter and in Investigating Life: Making Spider Silk) are made up of    pleated sheets.
7.3.2.4.3.1.5	Many proteins contain regions of both    helix and    pleated sheet in the same polypeptide chain.
7.3.2.5.1.1	In many proteins, the polypeptide chain is bent at specific sites and then folded back and forth, resulting in the tertiary structure of the protein (see Figure 3.7C).
7.3.2.5.1.2	Although    helices and    pleated sheets contribute to the tertiary structure, usually only portions of the macromolecule have these secondary structures, and large regions consist of tertiary structure unique to a particular protein.
7.3.2.5.1.3	For example, the proteins found in stretchy spider silks (see the opening story) have repeated amino acid sequences that cause the proteins to fold into spirals.
7.3.2.5.1.4	Tertiary structure is a macromolecule   s definitive three-dimensional shape, often including a buried interior as well as a surface that is exposed to the environment.
7.3.2.5.2.1	The protein   s exposed outer surfaces present functional groups capable of interacting with other molecules in the cell.
7.3.2.5.2.2	These molecules might be other macromolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipid structures, or smaller chemical substances.
7.3.2.5.3.1	You saw that hydrogen bonding between the N   H and C==O groups within and between chains is responsible for secondary structure.
7.3.2.5.3.2	For tertiary structure, the interactions between R groups   the amino acid side chains   and between R groups and the environment are key.
7.3.2.5.3.3	Recall the various strong and weak interactions between atoms described in Key Concept 2.2.
7.3.2.5.3.4	Here is how these interactions are involved in determining and maintaining tertiary structure:
7.3.2.5.4.1	Covalent disulfide bridges can form between specific cysteine side chains (see Figure 3.5), holding a folded polypeptide in place.
7.3.2.5.5.1	Hydrogen bonds between side chains also stabilize folds in proteins.
7.3.2.5.6.1	Hydrophobic side chains can aggregate together in the interior of the protein, away from water, folding the polypeptide in the process.
7.3.2.5.6.2	Close interactions between the hydrophobic side chains are stabilized by van der Waals forces.
7.3.2.5.7.1	Ionic attractions can form between positively and negatively charged side chains, forming salt bridges between amino acids.
7.3.2.5.7.2	Salt bridges can be near the surfaces of polypeptides or buried deep within a protein, away from water.
7.3.2.5.7.3	These interactions occur between positively and negatively charged amino acids, for example glutamic acid (which has a negatively charged R group) and arginine (which is positively charged) (see Table 3.2):
7.3.2.5.8.1	Figure 3.9 Three Representations of Lysozyme Different molecular representations of a protein emphasize different aspects of its tertiary structure: surface features, sites of bends and folds, or sites where alpha or beta structures predominate.
7.3.2.5.8.2	These three representations of lysozyme are similarly oriented.
7.3.2.5.9.1	Q: Can you identify regions of the protein that are hydrophilic?
7.3.2.5.9.2	Hydrophobic?
7.3.2.5.10.1	A protein folds into its final shape in a way that maximizes all the interactions noted and minimizes inappropriate interactions, such as two positively charged residues (a term identifying monomers in a polymer) being near one another, or a hydrophobic residue being near water.
7.3.2.5.10.2	A complete description of a protein   s tertiary structure would specify the location of every atom in the molecule in three-dimensional space relative to all the other atoms.
7.3.2.5.10.3	Figure 3.9 shows three ways of modeling the structure of the protein lysozyme.
7.3.2.5.10.4	Each way has its uses.
7.3.2.5.10.5	The space-filling model might be used to study how other molecules interact with specific sites and R groups on the protein   s surface.
7.3.2.5.10.6	The stick model emphasizes the sites where bends occur, resulting in folds in the polypeptide chain.
7.3.2.5.10.7	The ribbon model, perhaps the most widely used, shows the different types of secondary structure and how they fold into the tertiary structure.
7.3.2.5.11.1	Remember that both secondary and tertiary structure derive from primary structure.
7.3.2.5.11.2	If a protein is heated slowly and moderately, the heat energy will disrupt only the weak interactions, causing the secondary and tertiary structure to break down.
7.3.2.5.11.3	The protein is then said to be denatured.
7.3.2.5.11.4	A comparison of native (untreated) and denatured proteins shows major differences:
7.3.2.5.12.1	Native proteins are compact; denatured proteins have a larger volume.
7.3.2.5.13.1	Native proteins exist in one, preferred shape; denatured proteins can take many shapes.
7.3.2.5.14.1	Native proteins have hydrogen bonds that stabilize the structure internally; denatured proteins have hydrogen bonds on the exterior, to water.
7.3.2.5.15.1	You can   t    unboil  ? an egg after it has been hard-boiled; the egg proteins are irreversibly denatured.
7.3.2.5.15.2	Amazingly, in some cases a protein can return to its normal tertiary structure when it cools, demonstrating that all the information needed to specify the unique shape of a protein is contained in its primary structure.
7.3.2.5.15.3	This was first shown (using chemicals instead of heat to denature the protein) by biochemist Christian Anfinsen for the protein ribonuclease (Figure 3.10).

7.3.2.5.22.1	METHOD Chemically denature a functional ribonuclease so that only its primary structure (i. e. , an unfolded polypeptide chain) remains.
7.3.2.5.22.2	Once denaturation is complete, remove the disruptive chemicals.
7.3.2.5.23.1	RESULT When the disruptive agents are removed, three-dimensional structure is restored and the protein once again is functional.
7.3.2.5.24.1	CONCLUSION In normal cellular conditions, the primary structure of a protein specifies how it folds into a functional, three-dimensional structure.

7.3.2.5.26.1	Figure 3.10B Primary Structure Specifies Tertiary Structure
7.3.2.5.27.1	Original Paper: Anfinsen, C. B. et al. 1961; White, Jr. , F. 1961.
7.3.2.5.27.2	After the tertiary structures of proteins were shown to be highly specific, the question arose as to how the order of amino acids determined the three-dimensional structure.
7.3.2.5.27.3	The second protein whose structure was determined was ribonuclease A (RNase A).
7.3.2.5.27.4	This enzyme was readily available from cow pancreases at slaughterhouses and, because it works in the highly acidic environment of the cow stomach, was stable compared with most proteins and easy to purify.
7.3.2.5.27.5	RNase A has 124 amino acids.
7.3.2.5.27.6	Among these are eight cysteine residues, which form four disulfide bridges.
7.3.2.5.27.7	Were these covalent links between cysteines essential for the three-dimensional structure of RNase A?
7.3.2.5.27.8	As outlined in Figure 3.10A, Christian Anfinsen and his colleagues set out to answer this question.
7.3.2.5.28.1	QUESTIONS
7.3.2.5.29.1	Initially, the disulfide bonds (S&#x2014;S) in RNase A were eliminated because the sulfur atoms in cysteine residues were all reduced (&#x2014;SH).
7.3.2.5.29.2	At time zero, reoxidation began; and at various times, the amount of S&#x2014;S bond re-formation and the activity of the enzyme were measured by chemical methods.
7.3.2.5.29.3	The data are shown in Figure A. At what time did disulfide bonds begin to form?
7.3.2.5.29.4	At what time did enzyme activity begin to appear?
7.3.2.5.29.5	Explain the difference between these times.
7.3.2.5.30.1	The three-dimensional structure of RNase A was examined by ultraviolet spectroscopy.
7.3.2.5.30.2	In this technique, the protein was exposed to different wavelengths of ultraviolet light (measured in nanometers) and the amount of light absorbed by the protein at each wavelength was measured (E).
7.3.2.5.30.3	The results are plotted in Figure B.
7.3.2.5.31.1	Look carefully at the plots.
7.3.2.5.31.2	What are the differences between the peak absorbances of native (untreated) and reduced (denatured) RNase A?
7.3.2.5.31.3	What happened when reduced RNase A was reoxidized (renatured)?
7.3.2.5.31.4	What can you conclude about the structure of RNase A from these experiments?
7.3.2.5.32.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.3.2.6.1.1	Many functional proteins contain two or more polypeptide chains, called subunits, each of them folded into its own unique tertiary structure.
7.3.2.6.1.2	The protein   s quaternary structure results from the ways in which these subunits bind together and interact (see Figure 3.7D).
7.3.2.6.1.3	Figure 3.11 Quaternary Structure of a Protein
7.3.2.6.2.1	Hemoglobin has four polypeptide chains interacting to form quaternary structure (Figure 3.11).
7.3.2.6.2.2	Hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds, and ionic attractions all help hold the four subunits together to form a hemoglobin molecule.
7.3.2.6.2.3	However, the weak nature of these forces permits small changes in the quaternary structure to aid the protein   s function   which is to carry oxygen in red blood cells.
7.3.2.6.2.4	As hemoglobin binds one O2 molecule, the four subunits shift their relative positions slightly, changing the quaternary structure.
7.3.2.6.2.5	Ionic attractions are broken, exposing buried side chains that enhance the binding of additional O2 molecules.
7.3.2.6.2.6	The quaternary structure changes back when hemoglobin releases its O2 molecules to the cells of the body.
7.3.2.7.1.1	The shapes of proteins allow specific sites on their exposed surfaces to bind noncovalently to other molecules, which may be large or small.
7.3.2.7.1.2	The binding is usually very specific because only certain compatible chemical groups will bind to one another.
7.3.2.7.1.3	The specificity of protein binding depends on two general properties of the protein: its shape, and the chemistry of its exposed surface groups.
7.3.2.7.1.4	Figure 3.12 Noncovalent Interactions between Proteins and Other Molecules
7.3.2.7.2.1	Q: Why are these interactions sensitive to heat?
7.3.2.7.2.2	(Hint: see Table 2.1. )
7.3.2.7.3.1	Shape.
7.3.2.7.3.2	When a small molecule collides with and binds to a much larger protein, it is like a baseball being caught by a catcher   s mitt: the mitt has a shape that binds to the ball and fits around it.
7.3.2.7.3.3	Just as a hockey puck or a pingpong ball does not fit a baseball catcher   s mitt, a given molecule will not bind to a protein unless there is a general    fit  ? between their three-dimensional shapes.
7.3.2.7.4.1	Chemistry.
7.3.2.7.4.2	The exposed R groups on the surface of a protein permit chemical interactions with other substances (Figure 3.12).
7.3.2.7.4.3	Three types of interactions may be involved: ionic, hydrophobic, or hydrogen bonding.
7.3.2.7.4.4	Many important functions of proteins involve interactions between surface R groups and other molecules.
7.3.2.8.1.1	Because they are determined by weak forces, the three-dimensional structures of proteins are influenced by environmental conditions.
7.3.2.8.1.2	Conditions that would not break covalent bonds can disrupt the weaker, noncovalent interactions that determine secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure.
7.3.2.8.1.3	Such alterations may affect a protein   s shape and thus its function.
7.3.2.8.1.4	Various conditions can alter the weak, noncovalent interactions:
7.3.2.8.2.1	Increases in temperature cause more rapid molecular movements and thus can break hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions.
7.3.2.8.3.1	Changes in pH can change the pattern of ionization of exposed carboxyl and amino groups in the R groups of amino acids, thus disrupting the pattern of ionic attractions and repulsions.
7.3.2.8.4.1	High concentrations of polar substances such as urea can disrupt the hydrogen bonding that is crucial to protein structure.
7.3.2.8.4.2	Urea was used in the experiment on reversible protein denaturation shown in Figure 3.10.
7.3.2.8.5.1	Nonpolar substances may also disrupt normal protein structure in cases where hydrophobic interactions are essential to maintain the structure.
7.3.2.9.1.1	As we saw in the case of hemoglobin, which undergoes subtle shape changes when it binds oxygen, the shapes of proteins can change as a result of their interactions with other molecules.
7.3.2.9.1.2	Proteins can also change shape if they undergo covalent modifications.
7.3.2.9.2.1	Figure 3.13 Protein Structure Can Change
7.3.2.9.3.1	Proteins can change their tertiary structure when they bind to other molecules (A) or are modified chemically (B).
7.3.2.9.4.1	Proteins interact with other molecules.
7.3.2.9.4.2	Proteins do not exist in isolation.
7.3.2.9.4.3	In fact, if a biochemist    goes fishing  ? with a particular protein, by attaching the protein to a chemical    hook  ? and inserting it into cells, the protein will often be attached to something else when it is    reeled in.  ?
7.3.2.9.4.4	These molecular interactions are reminiscent of the interactions that make up quaternary structure (see above).
7.3.2.9.4.5	If a polypeptide comes into contact with another molecule, R groups on its surface may form weak interactions (e. g. , hydrophobic, van der Waals) with groups on the surface of the other molecule.
7.3.2.9.4.6	This may disrupt some of the interactions between R groups within the polypeptide, causing it to undergo a change in shape (Figure 3.13A).
7.3.2.9.4.7	You will see many instances of this in the coming chapters.
7.3.2.9.5.1	Proteins undergo *covalent modifications.
7.3.2.9.5.2	After it is made, the structure of a protein can be modified by the covalent bonding of a chemical group to the side chain of one or more of its amino acids.
7.3.2.9.5.3	The chemical modification of just one amino acid can alter the shape and function of a protein.
7.3.2.9.5.4	An example is the addition of a charged phosphate group to a relatively nonpolar R group.
7.3.2.9.5.5	This can cause the amino acid to become more hydrophilic and to move to the outer surface of the protein, altering the shape of the protein in the region near the amino acid (Figure 3.13B).
7.3.2.9.6.1	*connect the concepts Covalent modifications of proteins with subsequent changes in shape and function underlie many biological processes, ranging from signaling within the cell (see Key Concept 7.3) to the action of plant hormones on growth (see Key Concept 37.2).
7.3.2.10.1.1	Within a living cell, a polypeptide chain is sometimes in danger of binding the wrong substance.
7.3.2.10.1.2	There are two major situations when this can occur:
7.3.2.10.2.1	Just after a protein is made.
7.3.2.10.2.2	When a protein has not yet folded completely, it can present a surface that binds the wrong molecule.
7.3.2.10.3.1	Following denaturation.
7.3.2.10.3.2	Certain conditions, such as moderate heat, can cause some proteins in a living cell to denature without killing the organism.
7.3.2.10.3.3	Before the protein can refold, it may present a surface that binds the wrong molecule.
7.3.2.10.3.4	In these cases, the inappropriate binding may be irreversible.
7.3.2.10.3.5	Figure 3.14 Molecular Chaperones Protect Proteins from Inappropriate Binding
7.3.2.10.4.1	Q: Why are heat shock proteins important for a cell?
7.3.2.10.5.1	Many cells have a special class of proteins, called chaperones, that protect the three-dimensional structures of other proteins.
7.3.2.10.5.2	They bind to their partner proteins just as they are being made and also when they become denatured.
7.3.2.10.5.3	Like the chaperones at a high school dance, chaperone proteins prevent inappropriate interactions and enhance appropriate ones.
7.3.2.10.5.4	Typically, a chaperone protein has a cagelike structure that pulls in a polypeptide, causes it to fold into the correct shape, and then releases it (Figure 3.14).
7.3.2.10.5.5	Tumors make chaperone proteins, possibly to stabilize proteins important in the cancer process, and so chaperone-inhibiting drugs are being designed for use in chemotherapy.
7.3.2.10.5.6	In some clinical situations, treatment with these inhibitors results in the inappropriate folding of proteins in tumor cells, causing the tumors to stop growing.
7.3.2.10.6.1	3.2 recap
7.3.2.10.7.1	Proteins are polymers of amino acids.
7.3.2.10.7.2	The sequence of amino acids in a protein is its primary structure.
7.3.2.10.7.3	Secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures arise through interactions among the amino acids.
7.3.2.10.7.4	A protein   s three-dimensional shape and exposed chemical groups establish its binding specificity for other substances.
7.3.2.10.8.1	learning outcomes
7.3.2.10.9.1	You should be able to:
7.3.2.10.10.1	Predict how a protein   s tertiary structure will be affected by a change in an amino acid in its primary structure.
7.3.2.10.11.1	Analyze data to determine why an amino acid change in a protein leads to a change in the protein   s shape.
7.3.2.10.12.1	Predict the effects of various environmental factors on a protein   s structure.
7.3.2.10.13.1	Suppose that, in a given protein, one lysine is replaced by aspartic acid (see Table 3.2).
7.3.2.10.13.2	Does this change occur in the primary structure or in the secondary structure?
7.3.2.10.13.3	How might it result in a change in tertiary structure?
7.3.2.10.13.4	In quaternary structure?
7.3.2.10.14.1	A single amino acid change in a protein can change its shape.
7.3.2.10.14.2	For example, the amino acid glycine may normally reside at a certain position in a protein.
7.3.2.10.14.3	If glycine is replaced with either glutamic acid or arginine, the protein shape near that amino acid changes significantly.
7.3.2.10.14.4	There are two possible explanations for this:
7.3.2.10.15.1	a. A small amino acid at that position in the polypeptide is necessary for normal shape.
7.3.2.10.16.1	b. An uncharged amino acid is necessary for normal shape.
7.3.2.10.16.2	Further amino acid substitutions are done to distinguish between these possibilities.
7.3.2.10.16.3	Replacing glycine with serine or alanine results in normal shape, but replacing glycine with valine changes the shape.
7.3.2.10.16.4	Which of the two possible explanations is supported by the observations?
7.3.2.10.16.5	Explain your answer.
7.3.2.10.17.1	Human hair is composed of the protein keratin.
7.3.2.10.17.2	At the hair salon, two techniques are used to modify the three-dimensional shape of hair.
7.3.2.10.17.3	Styling involves heat, and a perm involves cleaving and re-forming disulfide bonds.
7.3.2.10.17.4	How would you investigate these phenomena in terms of protein structure?
7.3.2.10.18.1	Chapter 3 continues with
7.3.2.10.19.1	3.3 Simple Sugars Are the Basic Structural Unit of Carbohydrates
7.3.3.1.1	Monosaccharides are simple sugars
7.3.3.2.1	Glycosidic linkages bond monosaccharides
7.3.3.3.1	Polysaccharides store energy and provide structural materials
7.3.3.4.1	Starch
7.3.3.5.1	Glycogen
7.3.3.6.1	Cellulose
7.3.3.7.1	Chemically modified carbohydrates contain additional functional groups
7.3.3.8.1	Carbohydrates make up a large group of molecules that all have similar atomic compositions but differ greatly in size, chemical properties, and biological functions.
7.3.3.8.2	Carbohydrates usually have the general formula (C1H2O1)n, (n stands for a number), which makes them appear as    hydrates of carbon  ? (a hydrate refers to water), hence their name.
7.3.3.8.3	However, carbohydrates are not really    hydrates  ? because the water molecules are not intact.
7.3.3.8.4	Rather, the linked carbon atoms are bonded with hydrogen atoms (&#x2014;H) and hydroxyl groups (&#x2014;OH), the components of water.
7.3.3.9.1	Carbohydrates have four major biochemical roles:
7.3.3.10.1	They are a source of stored energy that can be released in a form usable by organisms.
7.3.3.11.1	They are used to transport stored energy within complex organisms.
7.3.3.12.1	They serve as carbon skeletons that can be rearranged to form new molecules.
7.3.3.13.1	They form extracellular assemblies such as cell walls that provide structure to organisms.
7.3.3.14.1	Some carbohydrates are relatively small, with molecular weights of less than 100.
7.3.3.14.2	Others are true macromolecules, with molecular weights in the hundreds of thousands.
7.3.3.15.1	focus your learning
7.3.3.16.1	Carbohydrates function primarily in storing and transporting chemical energy and as sources of carbon for building new macromolecules.
7.3.3.17.1	Polysaccharides of glucose all provide energy storage and structural functions but vary in branching patterns and type of glycosidic linkages between glucose units.
7.3.3.18.1	There are four categories of biologically important carbohydrate defined by the number of monomers:
7.3.3.19.1	Monosaccharides (mono,    one,  ? + saccharide,    sugar  ?), such as glucose, are simple sugars.
7.3.3.19.2	They are the monomers from which the larger carbohydrates are constructed.
7.3.3.20.1	Disaccharides (di,    two  ?) consist of two monosaccharides linked together by covalent bonds.
7.3.3.20.2	The most familiar is sucrose, which is made up of covalently bonded glucose and fructose molecules.
7.3.3.21.1	Oligosaccharides (oligo,    several  ?) are made up of several (3&#x2013;20) monosaccharides.
7.3.3.22.1	Polysaccharides (poly,    many  ?), such as starch, glycogen, and cellulose, are polymers made up of hundreds or thousands of monosaccharides.
7.3.3.1.1.1	All living cells contain the monosaccharide glucose; it is the    blood sugar  ? used to store and transport energy in humans.
7.3.3.1.1.2	Cells use glucose as an energy source, breaking it down through a series of reactions that converts stored energy to more usable chemical energy and produce carbon dioxide; this is a cellular form of the combustion reaction you saw in Key Concept 2.3.
7.3.3.1.2.1	Glucose exists in straight chains and in ring forms.
7.3.3.1.2.2	The ring forms predominate in virtually all biological circumstances because they are more stable in water.
7.3.3.1.2.3	There are two versions of the glucose ring, called &#x03B1;- and &#x03B2;-glucose, which differ only in the orientation of the    H and    OH groups attached to carbon 1 (Figure 3.15).
7.3.3.1.2.4	The    and    forms interconvert and exist in equilibrium when dissolved in water.
7.3.3.1.3.1	Figure 3.15 From One Form of Glucose to the Other
7.3.3.1.4.1	All glucose molecules have the formula C6H12O6, but their structures vary.
7.3.3.1.4.2	When dissolved in water, the &#x03B1; and &#x03B2; &#x201C;ring&#x201D; forms of glucos interconvert.
7.3.3.1.4.3	The convention used here for numbering the carbon atoms is standard in biochemistry.
7.3.3.1.5.1	Different monosaccharides contain different numbers of carbons.
7.3.3.1.5.2	Some monosaccharides are structural isomers, with the same kinds and numbers of atoms but in different arrangements (Figure 3.16).
7.3.3.1.5.3	Such seemingly small structural changes can significantly alter their properties.
7.3.3.1.5.4	Most of the monosaccharides in living systems belong to the D (right-handed) series of optical isomers.
7.3.3.1.6.1	Figure 3.16 Monosaccharides Are Simple Sugars
7.3.3.1.7.1	Monosaccharides are made up of varying numbers of carbons.
7.3.3.1.7.2	Some hexoses are structural isomers that have the same kind and number of atoms, but the atoms are arranged differently.
7.3.3.1.7.3	Fructose, for example, is a hexose but forms a five-membered ring like the pentoses.
7.3.3.1.8.1	Pentoses (pente,    five  ?) are five-carbon sugars.
7.3.3.1.8.2	Two pentoses are of particular biological importance: the backbones of the nucleic acids RNA and DNA contain ribose and deoxyribose, respectively (see Key Concept 4.1).
7.3.3.1.8.3	These two pentoses are not isomers of each other; rather, one oxygen atom is missing from carbon 2 in deoxyribose (de-,    absent  ?).
7.3.3.1.8.4	The absence of this oxygen atom is an important distinction between RNA and DNA.
7.3.3.1.9.1	The hexoses (hex,    six  ?) shown in Figures 3.15 and 3.16 are a group of structural isomers with the formula C6H12O6.
7.3.3.1.9.2	Common hexoses are glucose, fructose (so named because it was first found in fruits), mannose, and galactose.
7.3.3.2.1.1	The disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides are all constructed from monosaccharides that are covalently bonded together by condensation reactions that form glycosidic linkages (Figure 3.17).
7.3.3.2.1.2	A single glycosidic linkage between two monosaccharides forms a disaccharide.
7.3.3.2.1.3	For example, sucrose   common table sugar (the real stuff, not artificial sweetener) in the human diet and the major disaccharide in plants   is formed from a glucose and a fructose molecule.
7.3.3.2.2.1	Figure 3.17 Disaccharides Form by Glycosidic Linkages
7.3.3.2.3.1	Glycosidic linkages between two monosaccharides can create many different disaccharides.
7.3.3.2.3.2	The particular disaccharide formed depends on which monosaccharides are linked, on the site of linkage (i. e. , which carbon atoms are involved), and on the form (&#x03B1; or &#x03B2;) of the linkage.
7.3.3.2.4.1	The disaccharides maltose and cellobiose are made from two glucose molecules (see Figure 3.17).
7.3.3.2.4.2	Maltose and cellobiose are structural isomers, both having the formula C12H22O11.
7.3.3.2.4.3	However, they have different chemical properties and are recognized by different *enzymes in biological tissues.
7.3.3.2.4.4	For example, maltose can be hydrolyzed into its monosaccharides in the human body, whereas cellobiose cannot.
7.3.3.2.5.1	*connect the concepts Enzymes are an important class of proteins that may change shape when they come into contact with a reactant in a biochemical reaction.
7.3.3.2.5.2	Each enzyme is specific for the reactant it binds.
7.3.3.2.5.3	See Key Concept 8.4.
7.3.3.2.6.1	Oligosaccharides contain several monosaccharides bound by glycosidic linkages at various sites.
7.3.3.2.6.2	Many oligosaccharides have additional functional groups, which give them special properties.
7.3.3.2.6.3	Oligosaccharides are often covalently bonded to proteins and lipids on the outer cell surface, where they serve as recognition signals.
7.3.3.2.6.4	The different human blood groups (e. g. , the ABO blood types) get their specificities from oligosaccharide chains.
7.3.3.3.1.1	Polysaccharides are large (sometimes gigantic) polymers of monosaccharides connected by glycosidic linkages (Figure 3.18).
7.3.3.3.1.2	In contrast to polypeptides, polysaccharides are not necessarily linear chains of monomers.
7.3.3.3.1.3	Each monomer unit has several sites that are capable of forming glycosidic linkages, and thus branched molecules are possible.
7.3.3.41.1.1.1	Starches comprise a family of large molecules with similar structures.
7.3.3.41.1.1.2	While all starches are polysaccharides of glucose with   -glycosidic linkages (     1,4 and      1,6 glycosidic bonds; see Figure 3.18A), the different starches can be distinguished by the amount of branching that occurs at carbons 1 and 6 (see Figure 3.18B).
7.3.3.41.1.1.3	Starch is the principal energy storage compound of plants.
7.3.3.41.1.1.4	Some plant starches, such as amylose, are unbranched; others are moderately branched (for example, amylopectin).
7.3.3.41.1.1.5	Starch readily binds water; if you   re a cook you know this.
7.3.3.41.1.1.6	However, when water is removed, hydrogen bonds form between the unbranched polysaccharide chains, which then aggregate.
7.3.3.41.1.1.7	Large starch aggregates called starch grains can be observed in the storage tissues of plant seeds (see Figure 3.18C).
7.3.3.41.1.1.8	These aggregates are broken up when starch is heated, breaking the hydrogen bonds.
7.3.3.41.1.1.9	The starch becomes less solid and crystalline and water is absorbed, making the starch even more amorphous.
7.3.3.41.1.1.10	This is what happens in baking with wheat flour, and is what gives bread its texture.
7.3.3.41.1.1.11	Next time you eat some bread, think of hydrogen bonds!
7.3.3.41.1.2.1	Figure 3.18 Representative Polysaccharides
7.3.3.41.1.3.1	Cellulose, starch, and glycogen have different levels of branching and compaction of the polysaccharides.
7.3.3.41.2.1.1	Glycogen is a water-insoluble, highly branched polymer of glucose.
7.3.3.41.2.1.2	It is used to store glucose in the liver and muscles and is thus an energy storage compound for animals, as starch is for plants.
7.3.3.41.2.1.3	Both glycogen and starch are readily hydrolyzed into glucose monomers, which in turn can be broken down to liberate their stored energy.
7.3.3.41.2.2.1	But if it is glucose that is needed for fuel, why store it in the form of glycogen?
7.3.3.41.2.2.2	The reason is that 1,000 glucose molecules would exert 1,000 times the osmotic pressure of a single glycogen molecule, causing water to enter cells where glucose is stored (see Key Concept 6.3).
7.3.3.41.2.2.3	If it were not for polysaccharides, many organisms would expend a lot of energy expelling excess water from their cells.
7.3.3.41.3.1.1	As the predominant component of plant cell walls, cellulose is by far the most abundant organic compound on Earth.
7.3.3.41.3.1.2	Like starch and glycogen, cellulose is a polysaccharide of glucose, but its individual monosaccharides are connected by   - rather than by   -glycosidic linkages.
7.3.3.41.3.1.3	Starch is easily degraded by the actions of chemicals or enzymes.
7.3.3.41.3.1.4	Cellulose, however, is chemically more stable because of its   -glycosidic linkages.
7.3.3.41.3.1.5	Thus whereas starch is easily broken down to supply glucose for energy-producing reactions, cellulose is an excellent structural material that can withstand harsh environmental conditions without substantial change.
7.3.3.4.1.1	Some carbohydrates are chemically modified by the addition of functional groups such as phosphate, amino, or N-acetyl groups (see Figure 3.19).
7.3.3.4.1.2	For example, a phosphate group may be added to one or more of the    OH sites (Figure 3.19A).
7.3.3.4.1.3	Some of the resulting sugar phosphates, such as fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, are important intermediates in cellular energy reactions, which you   ll see in Chapter 9.
7.3.3.4.1.4	Figure 3.19 Chemically Modified Carbohydrates
7.3.3.4.2.1	Added functional groups can modify the form and properties of a carbohydrate.
7.3.3.4.3.1	When an amino group (NH2) is substituted for an    OH group, amino sugars, such as glucosamine and galactosamine, are produced (see Figure 3.19B).
7.3.3.4.3.2	These compounds are important in the extracellular matrix (see Key Concept 5.4), where they form parts of glycoproteins, which are molecules involved in keeping tissues together.
7.3.3.4.3.3	Galactosamine is a major component of cartilage, the material that forms caps on the ends of bones and stiffens the ears and nose.
7.3.3.4.3.4	A derivative of glucosamine is present in the polymer chitin (see Figure 3.19C), the principal structural polysaccharide in the external skeletons of insects and many crustaceans (such as crabs and lobsters), and a component of the cell walls of fungi.
7.3.3.4.4.1	3.3 recap
7.3.3.4.5.1	Carbohydrates are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen and have the general formula (C1H2O1)n.
7.3.3.4.5.2	They provide energy and structure to cells and are precursors of numerous important biological molecules.
7.3.3.4.5.3	Monosaccharide monomers can be connected by glycosidic linkages to form disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides.
7.3.3.4.6.1	learning outcomes
7.3.3.4.7.1	You should be able to:
7.3.3.4.8.1	Identify the primary functions of carbohydrates in living organisms.
7.3.3.4.9.1	Explain why polysaccharides are useful structures for energy storage.
7.3.3.4.10.1	Use the chemical structures of polysaccharides to explain their properties.
7.3.3.4.11.1	What qualities of the polysaccharides starch and glycogen make them useful for energy storage?
7.3.3.4.12.1	After looking at the cellulose molecule in Figure 3.18A, can you see why a large number of hydrogen bonds are present in the linear structure of cellulose shown in Figure 3.18B?
7.3.3.4.12.2	Why is this structure so strong?
7.3.3.4.13.1	You have seen how amino acid monomers form protein polymers and how sugar monomers form the polymers of carbohydrates.
7.3.3.4.13.2	Now we will look at the lipids, which are unique among the four classes of large biological molecules in that they are not, strictly speaking, polymers.
7.3.3.4.14.1	Chapter 3 continues with
7.3.3.4.15.1	3.4 Lipids Are Defined by Their Solubility Rather Than by Chemical Structure
7.3.4.1.1	Fats and oils are triglycerides
7.3.4.2.1	Phospholipids form biological membranes
7.3.4.3.1	Some lipids have roles in energy conversion, regulation, and protection
7.3.4.4.1	carotenoids
7.3.4.5.1	steroids
7.3.4.6.1	vitamins
7.3.4.7.1	waxes
7.3.4.8.1	Lipids   colloquially called fats   are hydrocarbons that are insoluble in water because of their many nonpolar covalent bonds.
7.3.4.8.2	As you saw in Key Concept 2.2, nonpolar hydrocarbon molecules are hydrophobic and preferentially aggregate together, away from water, which is polar.
7.3.4.8.3	When nonpolar hydrocarbons are sufficiently close to one another, weak but additive van der Waals forces help hold them together.
7.3.4.8.4	The huge macromolecular aggregations that can form are not polymers in a strict chemical sense, because the individual lipid molecules are not covalently bonded.
7.3.4.8.5	With this understanding, it is still useful to consider aggregations of individual lipids as a different sort of polymer.
7.3.4.9.1	focus your learning
7.3.4.10.1	Triglycerides are simple lipids composed of glycerol bonded to three fatty acids via ester linkages.
7.3.4.11.1	Because phospholipids are amphipathic, they are able to aggregate to form phospholipid bilayers, which are useful in creating membrane structures.
7.3.4.12.1	Carotenoids, steroids, certain vitamins, and waxes are classified as lipids and have a variety of functions, depending on their chemical structures.
7.3.4.13.1	There are several different types of lipids, and they play a number of roles in living organisms:
7.3.4.14.1	Fats and oils store energy.
7.3.4.15.1	Phospholipids play important structural roles in cell membranes.
7.3.4.16.1	Carotenoids and chlorophylls help plants capture light energy.
7.3.4.17.1	Steroids and modified fatty acids play regulatory roles as hormones and vitamins.
7.3.4.18.1	Fat in animal bodies serves as thermal insulation.
7.3.4.19.1	A lipid coating around nerves provides electrical insulation.
7.3.4.20.1	Oil or wax on the surfaces of skin, fur, feathers, and leaves repels water and prevents excessive evaporation of water from terrestrial animals and plants.
7.3.4.1.1.1	Chemically, fats and oils are triglycerides, also known as simple lipids.
7.3.4.1.1.2	Triglycerides that are solid at room temperature (around 20  C) are called fats; those that are liquid at room temperature are called oils.
7.3.4.1.1.3	Triglycerides are composed of two types of building blocks: fatty acids and glycerol.
7.3.4.1.1.4	Glycerol is a small molecule with three hydroxyl (   OH) groups (thus it is an alcohol).
7.3.4.1.1.5	A fatty acid is made up of a long nonpolar hydrocarbon chain and an acidic polar carboxyl group (   COOH).
7.3.4.1.1.6	These chains are very hydrophobic because of their abundant C   H and C   C bonds, which have similar *electronegativity values and are therefore nonpolar.
7.3.4.1.2.1	*connect the concepts As discussed in Key Concept 2.2, electronegativity is a measure of the attraction an atomic nucleus exerts on electrons in a covalent bond.
7.3.4.1.2.2	When one interacting atom is much more electronegative than the other, a complete transfer of one or more electrons may take place.
7.3.4.1.3.1	A triglyceride contains three fatty acid molecules and one molecule of glycerol.
7.3.4.1.3.2	Making a triglyceride involves three condensation (dehydration) reactions.
7.3.4.1.3.3	In each reaction, the carboxyl group of a fatty acid bonds with a hydroxyl group of glycerol, resulting in a covalent bond called an ester linkage and the release of a water molecule (Figure 3.20).
7.3.4.1.3.4	The three fatty acids in a triglyceride molecule need not all have the same hydrocarbon chain length or structure; some may be saturated fatty acids, whereas others may be unsaturated: Figure 3.20 Synthesis of a Triglyceride
7.3.4.1.4.1	In living things, the reaction that forms a triglyceride is more complex, but the end result is the same as shown here.
7.3.4.1.5.1	In saturated fatty acids, all the bonds between the carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon chain are single bonds   there are no double bonds.
7.3.4.1.5.2	That is, all the bonds are saturated with hydrogen atoms (Figure 3.21A).
7.3.4.1.5.3	These fatty acid molecules are relatively straight, and they pack together tightly, like pencils in a box.
7.3.4.1.6.1	In unsaturated fatty acids, the hydrocarbon chain contains one or more double bonds.
7.3.4.1.6.2	Linoleic acid is an example of a polyunsaturated fatty acid that has two double bonds near the middle of the hydrocarbon chain, causing kinks in the molecule (Figure 3.21B).
7.3.4.1.6.3	Such kinks prevent the unsaturated fat molecules from packing together tightly.
7.3.4.1.6.4	Figure 3.21 Saturated and Unsaturated Fatty Acids
7.3.4.1.7.1	(A) The straight hydrocarbon chain of a saturated fatty acid allows the molecule to pack tightly with other, similar molecules.
7.3.4.1.7.2	(B) In unsaturated fatty acids, kinks in the chain prevent close packing.
7.3.4.1.7.3	The color convention in the models shown here (gray, H; red, O; black, C) is commonly used.
7.3.4.1.8.1	The kinks in fatty acid molecules are important in determining the fluidity and melting points of lipids.
7.3.4.1.8.2	The triglycerides of animal fats tend to have many long-chain saturated fatty acids packed tightly together; these fats are usually solids at room temperature and have high melting points.
7.3.4.1.8.3	The triglycerides of plants, such as corn oil, tend to have short or unsaturated fatty acids.
7.3.4.1.8.4	Because of their kinks, these fatty acids pack together poorly and have low melting points, and these triglycerides are usually liquids at room temperature.
7.3.4.1.9.1	Fatty acids are excellent storehouses for chemical energy.
7.3.4.1.9.2	As you will see in Chapter 9, when the C   H bond is broken, it releases significant energy that an organism can use for its own purposes, such as movement or building up other complex molecules.
7.3.4.2.1.1	We have mentioned the hydrophobic nature of the many C   C and C   H bonds in fatty acids.
7.3.4.2.1.2	But what about the carboxyl functional group at the end of the molecule?
7.3.4.2.1.3	When it ionizes and forms COO   , it is strongly hydrophilic.
7.3.4.2.1.4	So a fatty acid is a molecule with a hydrophilic end and a long hydrophobic    tail.  ?
7.3.4.2.1.5	It has two opposing chemical properties   part hydrophobic and part hydrophilic; the technical term for this is amphipathic.
7.3.4.2.2.1	Like triglycerides, phospholipids contain fatty acids bound to glycerol by ester linkages.
7.3.4.2.2.2	In phospholipids, however, any one of several phosphate-containing compounds replaces the first or third fatty acid, giving phospholipids amphipathic properties (Figure 3.22A).
7.3.4.2.2.3	The phosphate functional group has a negative electric charge, so this portion of the molecule is hydrophilic, attracting polar water molecules.
7.3.4.2.2.4	But the two fatty acids are hydrophobic, so they tend to avoid water and aggregate together or with other hydrophobic substances.
7.3.4.2.3.1	In an aqueous environment, phospholipids line up in such a way that the nonpolar, hydrophobic    tails  ? pack tightly together and the phosphate-containing    heads  ? face outward, where they interact with water.
7.3.4.2.3.2	The phospholipids can form a bilayer: a sheet two molecules thick, with water excluded from the core (Figure 3.22B).
7.3.4.2.3.3	Biological membranes have this kind of phospholipid bilayer structure, and we will devote Chapter 6 to their biological functions.
7.3.4.2.3.4	Figure 3.22 Phospholipids
7.3.4.2.4.1	(A) Phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) demonstrates the structure of a phospholipid molecule.
7.3.4.2.4.2	In other phospholipids, the amino acid serine, the sugar alcohol inositol, or other compounds replace choline.
7.3.4.2.4.3	(B) In an aqueous environment, hydrophobic interactions bring the &#x201C;tails&#x201D; of phospholipids together in the interior of a bilayer.
7.3.4.2.4.4	The hydrophilic &#x201C;heads&#x201D; face outward on both sides of the bilayer, where they interact with the surrounding water molecules.
7.3.4.3.1.1	In the paragraphs above we focused on triglycerides and phospholipids   lipids that are involved in energy storage and cell structure.
7.3.4.3.1.2	However, there are other nonpolar and amphipathic lipids that have different structures and roles.
7.3.4.31.1.1.1	The carotenoids are a family of light-absorbing pigments found in plants and animals.
7.3.4.31.1.1.2	Beta-carotene (  -carotene) is one of the pigments that traps light energy in leaves during photosynthesis.
7.3.4.31.1.1.3	In humans, a molecule of   -carotene can be broken down into two vitamin A molecules.
7.3.4.31.1.1.4	Vitamin A is used to make the pigment cis-retinal, which is required for vision.
7.3.4.31.1.2.1	Carotenoids are responsible for the colors of carrots, tomatoes, pumpkins, egg yolks, and butter.
7.3.4.31.1.2.2	The brilliant yellows and oranges of autumn leaves are also from carotenoids.
7.3.4.31.2.1.1	The steroids are a family of organic compounds whose multiple rings are linked through shared carbons.
7.3.4.31.2.1.2	The steroid cholesterol is an important constituent of membranes, helping maintain membrane integrity (see Key Concept 6.1).
7.3.4.31.2.2.1	Other steroids function as hormones: chemical signals that carry messages from one part of the body to another (see Chapter 40).
7.3.4.31.2.2.2	Cholesterol is synthesized in the liver and is the starting material for making steroid hormones such as testosterone and estrogen.
7.3.4.31.3.1.1	Vitamins are small molecules that are not synthesized by the human body or in some cases are synthesized in inadequate amounts and so must be acquired from the diet (see Chapter 51).
7.3.4.31.3.1.2	For example, vitamin A is formed from the   -carotene found in green and yellow vegetables (see above).
7.3.4.31.3.1.3	In humans, a deficiency of vitamin A leads to dry skin, eyes, and internal body surfaces, retarded growth and development, and night blindness, which is a diagnostic symptom for the deficiency.
7.3.4.31.3.1.4	You   ll see in Chapter 18 how plant biologists are producing crops that contain more vitamin A to alleviate this condition.
7.3.4.31.3.1.5	Vitamins D, E, and K are also lipids.
7.3.4.31.4.1.1	Birds and mammals have glands in their skins that secrete waxy coatings onto their hair or feathers.
7.3.4.31.4.1.2	These coatings repel water and help keep the hair and feathers pliable.
7.3.4.31.4.1.3	The shiny leaves of plants such as holly, familiar during winter holidays, also have waxy coatings.
7.3.4.31.4.1.4	Waxy coatings on plants can help them retain water and exclude pathogens.
7.3.4.31.4.1.5	Bees make their honeycombs out of wax.
7.3.4.31.4.1.6	Waxes are substances that are hydrophobic and plastic, or malleable, at room temperature.
7.3.4.31.4.1.7	Each wax molecule consists of a saturated, long-chain fatty acid and a saturated, long-chain alcohol joined by an ester linkage.
7.3.4.31.4.1.8	The result is a very long molecule with 40   60 CH2 groups.
7.3.4.31.4.2.1	investigatinglife
7.3.4.31.4.3.1	What are practical uses for spider silk?
7.3.4.31.4.4.1	Spider silk protein has many glycine and alanine resides, which are hydrophobic and cause the protein to fold into a fibrous shape.
7.3.4.31.4.4.2	More than 1,000 individual polypeptide chains hydrogen bond and hydrophobically interact with one another to form long silk fibers.
7.3.4.31.4.4.3	Because of the strength arising from its protein structure, spider silk is much desired for human uses.
7.3.4.31.4.4.4	Using genetic engineering, biologists have been able to harvest composite silk fibers produced by silkworms in industrial quantities.
7.3.4.31.4.4.5	Now that this composite silkworm&#x2013;spider silk is available, numerous applications (functions related to structure) can be contemplated.
7.3.4.31.4.4.6	For example, a recent study compared surgical sutures made from spider silk with widely used sutures made from synthetic fibers to hold together injured tendons.
7.3.4.31.4.4.7	The spider silk sutures were far superior, holding their strength over many cycles of tendon movement during healing.
7.3.4.31.4.4.8	Another application on the horizon is bulletproof vests: the energy required to break a spider silk filament is at least 100 times greater than the energy of a typical bullet in impact.
7.3.4.31.4.5.1	Future directions
7.3.4.31.4.6.1	Perhaps the most widespread use for spider silk may be in textiles.
7.3.4.31.4.6.2	By definition, textiles are flexible materials made of natural or artificial fibers (threads) that are woven together.
7.3.4.31.4.6.3	The clothes you are wearing are textiles, perhaps made of cotton fibers (made up of cellulose) or polyester fibers (an artificial polymer) or a combination.
7.3.4.31.4.6.4	Of course, silk fibers from silkworms have a long history in textiles, particularly in Asia.
7.3.4.31.4.6.5	The addition of spider silk fibers, or combined spider&#8211;silkworm silk to existing textiles, holds great promise to increase the strength and in some cases the flexibility of the textile.

7.3.4.31.4.16.1	In this chapter we discussed three of the classes of macromolecules that are characteristic of living organisms.
7.3.4.31.4.16.2	All organisms are made up of these three types of macromolecules, a fact that shows the wonderful biochemical unity of life.
7.3.4.31.4.16.3	This unity in turns implies that all life has a common origin (see Key Concept 1.1).
7.3.4.31.4.16.4	Essential to this origin was a fourth class of macromolecule, the nucleic acids.

7.3.summary.14.1	Disulfide bridges and noncovalent interactions between amino acids cause polypeptide chains to fold into three-dimensional tertiary structures.

7.4.8.1	Looking for Life
7.4.9.1	On Earth you can find organisms and the chemical signatures of life everywhere   even deep under the sea, inside volcanoes, buried in ice, and floating in the air.
7.4.9.2	Determining life   s origin is difficult because (with few exceptions) the simple organisms that first existed left no fossils.
7.4.9.3	On Mars, however, things might be different.
7.4.10.1	Mars has fascinated scientists (and science-fiction writers) since its discovery by astronomers more than 3,000 years ago.
7.4.10.2	A cold planet, Mars has a geology that has changed little over several billion years, and so any evidence of life may be preserved.
7.4.10.3	By the late nineteenth century, distinguished professors of astronomy firmly believed there was life on Mars, based on observations through telescopes that showed polar ice caps that changed with the seasons, darker areas thought to be liquid water, and even markings that resembled canals.
7.4.10.4	Better telescopes, chemical analyses based on light emission (spectroscopy), orbiting satellites, and landers controlled from Earth have laid to rest many of the initial ideas about life on Mars.
7.4.10.5	But the challenge of finding present or past life on Mars remains.
7.4.10.6	The search revolves around finding organisms, evidence of a current or past environment where life could exist, and chemical signatures of present or past life.
7.4.11.1	Unlike Earth, Mars now lacks a magnetic field to protect against cosmic radiation arriving from space.
7.4.11.2	The surface of Mars is assaulted with very high levels of radiation, making it inhospitable to life.
7.4.11.3	So any current life would have to be below the surface, where radiation is much lower.
7.4.12.1	Since life as we know it requires water, determining whether Mars now has or ever had water has been a central question.
7.4.12.2	It is now established that water exists on the surface of Mars   at the poles, frozen, and in water vapor in its atmosphere.
7.4.12.3	There is even evidence that trickles of water may exist on the surface, kept liquid in the bitter cold by a high salt concentration.
7.4.12.4	The discovery of methane (CH4) in the atmosphere of Mars has generated additional excitement and speculation.
7.4.12.5	Might this methane be a by-product of an organic reaction?
7.4.12.6	The search for evidence of the chemical elements (C, H, O, P, N, and S) of life introduced in Chapter 2 continues.
7.4.13.1	Can we find evidence of life on Mars?
7.4.14.1	Chapter 4 continues with

7.4.1.5.1	Nucleotides have other important roles
7.4.1.6.1	Nucleic acids contain life&#x2019;s genetic code.

7.4.1.6.4	Nucleic acids are uniquely capable of coding for and transmitting biological information.
7.4.1.7.1	focus your learning
7.4.1.8.1	The structures of DNA and RNA enable their functions in storing and transferring genetic information.
7.4.1.9.1	Base pairing between nucleotides in DNA and RNA provides the structure needed for transfer of genetic information.
7.4.1.10.1	Base sequences of nucleotides in DNA provide the chemical diversity needed for storage of genetic information.
7.4.1.11.1	Nucleotides other than those found in DNA and RNA have diverse functions within the cell.
7.4.1.1.1.1	Nucleic acids are polymers specialized for the storage, transmission, and use of genetic information.
7.4.1.1.1.2	There are two types of nucleic acids: DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid).
7.4.1.1.1.3	Although you have heard of it in countless pronouncements as a metaphor for the essence of something (&#x201C;It&#x2019;s in her DNA&#x201D;), DNA is first and foremost a macromolecule.
7.4.1.1.1.4	Its structure encodes hereditary information and passes it from generation to generation.
7.4.1.1.1.5	Through RNA intermediates, the information encoded in DNA specifies the amino acid sequences of proteins and controls the expression (that is, the synthesis) of other RNAs.
7.4.1.1.1.6	In Chapter 11 you will learn how, during cell division and reproduction, information is preserved from the DNA of the parental cell when both the cell and its DNA are duplicated to form two new daughter cells.
7.4.1.1.1.7	Chapter 13 will describe how information flows from DNA to RNA to the proteins that ultimately carry out many of life&#x2019;s functions.
7.4.1.1.1.8	Here we focus on the chemistry of the nucleic acids, revealing how their structures reflect their functions.
7.4.1.1.1.9	Figure 4.1  Nucleotide Chemistry
7.4.1.1.2.1	Nucleic acids are polymers composed of monomers called nucleotides.
7.4.1.1.2.2	A nucleotide has three components: a nitrogencontaining base, a pentose sugar, and one to three phosphate groups (Figure 4.1).
7.4.1.1.2.3	Molecules consisting of a pentose sugar and a nitrogenous base&#x2014;but no phosphate group&#x2014;are called nucleosides.
7.4.1.1.2.4	The nucleotides that make up nucleic acids contain just one phosphate group&#x2014;they are nucleoside monophosphates.
7.4.1.1.3.1	The bases of the nucleic acids take one of two chemical forms: a six-membered single-ring structure called a pyrimidine, or a fused double-ring structure called a purine (see Figure 4.1).
7.4.1.1.3.2	In DNA, the pentose sugar is deoxyribose, which differs from the ribose found in RNA by the absence of one oxygen atom (see Figure 3.16).
7.4.1.1.3.3	Figure 4.2  Linking Nucleotides Together
7.4.1.1.4.1	A nucleic acid forms when nucleotide monomers are added to an existing chain one at a time.
7.4.1.1.4.2	The pentose sugar in the last nucleotide of the existing chain and the phosphate on the new nucleotide undergo a condensation reaction (meaning H2O is removed; see Figure 3.4), and the resulting bond is called a phosphodiester linkage (Figure 4.2).
7.4.1.1.4.3	The phosphate on the incoming nucleotide is attached to the 5    carbon atom of its sugar, and the linkage occurs between it and the 3    carbon on the last sugar of the existing chain.
7.4.1.1.4.4	Because each nucleotide is added to the 3    carbon of the last sugar, nucleic acids are said to elongate in the 5   -to-3    direction.
7.4.1.1.5.1	As with carbohydrates (see Key Concept 3.3), nucleic acids can range in size.
7.4.1.1.5.2	Oligonucleotides are relatively short, with about 20 nucleotide monomers, whereas polynucleotides can be much longer.
7.4.1.1.6.1	Oligonucleotides include RNA molecules that function as &#x201C;primers&#x201D; to begin the duplication of DNA; RNA molecules that regulate the expression of genes; and synthetic DNA molecules used for amplifying and analyzing other, longer nucleotide sequences.
7.4.1.1.7.1	Polynucleotides, more commonly referred to as nucleic acids, include DNA and some RNA.
7.4.1.1.7.2	Polynucleotides can be very long, and indeed are the longest polymers in the living world.
7.4.1.1.7.3	Some DNA molecules in humans contain hundreds of millions of nucleotides.
7.4.1.2.1.1	DNA and RNA differ somewhat in their sugar groups, bases, and strand structure (Table 4.1).
7.4.1.2.1.2	Four bases are found in DNA: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).
7.4.1.2.1.3	RNA is also made up of four different monomers, but its nucleotides include uracil (U) instead of thymine. table 4.1  Distinguishing RNA from DNA Nucleic acid Sugar Bases Name of nucleoside Strands RNA Ribose Adenine Adenosine One Cytosine Cytidine Guanine Guanosine Uracil Uridine RNA Deoxyribose Adenine Deoxyadenosine Two Cytosine Deoxycytidine Guanine Deoxyguanosine Thymine Deoxythymidine
7.4.1.2.2.1	A key to understanding the structure and function of nucleic acids is the principle of complementary base pairing.
7.4.1.2.2.2	In DNA, thymine and adenine pair (T-A), and cytosine and guanine pair (C-G).
7.4.1.2.2.3	In RNA, the base pairs are A-U and C-G.
7.4.1.2.3.1	Base pairs are held together primarily by hydrogen bonds.
7.4.1.2.3.2	As you can see, there are polar C==O and N&#x2014;H covalent bonds in the bases; these can form hydrogen bonds between the       on an oxygen or nitrogen of one base and the   + on a hydrogen of another base.
7.4.1.2.4.1	Individual hydrogen bonds are relatively weak, but there are so many of them in a DNA or RNA molecule that collectively they provide a considerable force of attraction, which can bind together two polynucleotide strands, or a single strand that folds back onto itself.
7.4.1.2.4.2	This attraction is not as strong as a covalent bond, however.
7.4.1.2.4.3	This means that individual base pairs are relatively easy to break with a modest input of energy.
7.4.1.2.4.4	As you will see, the breaking and making of hydrogen bonds in nucleic acids is vital to their role in living systems.
7.4.1.2.5.1	RNA Even though RNA is generally single-stranded (Figure 4.3A), base pairing can occur between different regions of the molecule.
7.4.1.2.5.2	Portions of the single-stranded RNA molecule can fold back and pair with one another (Figure 4.3B).
7.4.1.2.5.3	Thus complementary hydrogen bonding between ribonucleotides plays an important role in determining the three-dimensional shapes of some RNA molecules.
7.4.1.2.5.4	Complementary base pairing can also take place between ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides.
7.4.1.2.5.5	Adenine in an RNA strand can pair either with uracil (in another RNA strand) or with thymine (in a DNA strand).
7.4.1.2.5.6	Similarly, an adenine in DNA can pair either with thymine (in the complementary DNA strand) or with uracil (in RNA).
7.4.1.2.5.7	Figure 4.3  RNA
7.4.1.2.6.1	Q: What would happen if a folded RNA molecule were heated?
7.4.1.2.6.2	Recall the effect of heat on hydrogen bonds.
7.4.1.2.7.1	DNA Usually, *DNA is double-stranded; that is, it consists of two separate polynucleotide strands of the same length that are held together by hydrogen bonds between base pairs (Focus: Key Figure 4.4A).
7.4.1.2.7.2	In contrast to RNA&#x2019;s diversity in three-dimensional structure, DNA is remarkably uniform.
7.4.1.2.7.3	The A-T and G-C base pairs are about the same size (each is a purine paired with a pyrimidine), and the two polynucleotide strands form a &#x201C;ladder&#x201D; that twists into a double helix (Focus: Key Figure 4.4B).
7.4.1.2.7.4	The sugar   phosphate groups form the sides of the ladder, and the bases with their hydrogen bonds form the &#x201C;rungs&#x201D; on the inside.
7.4.1.2.7.5	DNA carries genetic information in its sequence of base pairs rather than in its three-dimensional structure.
7.4.1.2.7.6	The key differences among DNA molecules are their different nucleotide base sequences.
7.4.1.2.8.1	focus: key figure
7.4.1.2.9.1	Figure 4.4 DNA
7.4.1.2.10.1	(A) DNA usually consists of two strands running in opposite directions that are held together by hydrogen bonds between purines and pyrimidines on the two strands.
7.4.1.2.10.2	(B) The two strands in DNA are coiled in a right-handed double helix.
7.4.1.2.11.1	Q: For replication or transcription, DNA must &#x201C;unwind&#x201D; to expose bases.
7.4.1.2.11.2	What bonds must be broken for this to occur?
7.4.1.2.12.1	*connect the concepts As explained in Key Concept 13.2, the two strands of a DNA molecule fit together perfectly because they run in opposite directions&#x2014;that is, they are antiparallel to one another.
7.4.1.2.12.2	Equal distance between strands is maintained because a purine on one strand is always found opposite a pyrimidine on the other.
7.4.1.3.1.1	DNA is an informational molecule.
7.4.1.3.1.2	The information is encoded in the sequence of bases carried in its strands.
7.4.1.3.1.3	For example, the information encoded in the sequence TCAGCA is different from the information in the sequence CCAGCA.
7.4.1.3.1.4	DNA transmits information in two ways:
7.4.1.3.2.1	DNA can be reproduced exactly.
7.4.1.3.2.2	This process, called DNA replication, is done by polymerization using an existing strand as a base-pairing template.
7.4.1.3.3.1	Certain DNA sequences can be copied into RNA, in a process called transcription.
7.4.1.3.3.2	The nucleotide sequence in the RNA can then be used to specify a sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain, in the process called translation.
7.4.1.3.3.3	The overall process of transcription and translation is called gene expression.
7.4.1.3.4.1	The details of these important processes will be described in later chapters, but it is important to realize two things at this point:
7.4.1.3.5.1	DNA replication and transcription depend on the base-pairing properties of nucleic acids.
7.4.1.3.5.2	Recall that the hydrogen-bonded base pairs are A-T and G-C in DNA and A-U and G-C in RNA.
7.4.1.3.5.3	Consider, for example, this double-stranded DNA region:
7.4.1.3.6.1	5   -TCAGCA-3
7.4.1.3.7.1	3   -AGTCGT-5
7.4.1.3.8.1	Transcription of the lower strand will result in a single strand of RNA with the sequence 5   -UCAGCA-3   .
7.4.1.3.8.2	Can you figure out the sequence that the top strand would produce?
7.4.1.3.9.1	DNA replication usually involves the entire DNA molecule.
7.4.1.3.9.2	Since DNA holds essential information, it must be replicated completely and accurately so that each new cell or new organism receives a complete set of DNA from its parent (Figure 4.5A).
7.4.1.3.9.3	The complete set of DNA in a living organism is called its genome.
7.4.1.3.9.4	However, not all of the information in the genome is needed at all times and in all tissues, and only small sections of the DNA are transcribed into RNA molecules.
7.4.1.3.9.5	The sequences of DNA that are transcribed into RNA are called genes (Figure 4.5B).
7.4.1.3.9.6	Figure 4.5 DNA Replication and Transcription
7.4.1.3.10.1	Q: What do you think determines whether a particular cell transcribes a sequence of DNA into RNA?
7.4.1.3.11.1	In humans, the gene that encodes the major protein in hair (keratin) is expressed in skin cells that produce hair.
7.4.1.3.11.2	The genetic information in the keratin-encoding gene is transcribed into RNA and then translated into a keratin polypeptide.
7.4.1.3.11.3	In other tissues such as the muscles, the keratin gene is not transcribed, but other genes are&#x2014;for example, the genes that encode proteins present in muscles but not in skin or hair.
7.4.1.3.11.4	These genes are turned on and off by the control of gene expression, which we will describe in Chapter 16.
7.4.1.4.1.1	DNA carries hereditary information from one generation to the next, gradually accumulating changes in its base sequences over long periods of time.
7.4.1.4.1.2	A series of DNA molecules stretches back through the lineage of every organism to the beginning of biological evolution on Earth, about 3.8 billion years ago.
7.4.1.4.1.3	Therefore closely related living species have more similar base sequences than do species that are more distantly related.
7.4.1.4.1.4	The same is true for closely related versus distantly related individuals within a species.
7.4.1.4.1.5	The details of how scientists use this information will be covered in Chapter 24.
7.4.1.4.2.1	Improvements in methods for DNA sequencing and analysis by computer programs have enabled scientists to determine the entire DNA base sequences&#x2014;the genome&#x2014;of many organisms, including humans, whose genome contains about 3 billion base pairs.
7.4.1.4.2.2	These studies have confirmed many of the evolutionary relationships that had been inferred previously from more traditional comparisons of body structure, biochemistry, and physiology.
7.4.1.4.2.3	For example, traditional comparisons had indicated that the closest living relative of humans (Homo sapiens) is the chimpanzee (genus Pan).
7.4.1.4.2.4	In fact, the chimpanzee genome shares more than 98 percent of its DNA base sequence with the human genome.
7.4.1.4.2.5	Increasingly, scientists turn to DNA analyses to elucidate evolutionary relationships when other comparisons are not possible or are not conclusive.
7.4.1.4.2.6	For example, DNA studies revealed a close relationship between starlings and mockingbirds that was not expected on the basis of their anatomy or behavior.
7.4.1.5.1.1	Nucleotides are more than just the building blocks of nucleic acids.
7.4.1.5.1.2	As we will describe in later chapters, there are several nucleotides (or modified nucleotides) with other functions:
7.4.1.5.2.1	ATP (adenosine triphosphate) acts as an agent of energy transfer in many biochemical reactions (see Key Concept 8.2).
7.4.1.5.3.1	GTP (guanosine triphosphate) serves as an energy source, especially in protein synthesis.
7.4.1.5.3.2	It also plays a role in the transfer of information from the environment to cells (see Key Concept 7.2).
7.4.1.5.4.1	cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) is a special nucleotide with an additional bond between the sugar and the phosphate group.
7.4.1.5.4.2	It is essential in many processes, including the actions of hormones and the transmission of information by the nervous system (see Key Concept 7.3).
7.4.1.5.5.1	Nucleotides play roles as carriers in the synthesis and breakdown of carbohydrates and lipids.
7.4.1.5.6.1	4.1 recap
7.4.1.5.7.1	The nucleic acids DNA and RNA are polymers made up of nucleotide monomers.
7.4.1.5.7.2	The sequence of nucleotides in DNA carries the information that is used by RNA to specify primary protein structure.
7.4.1.5.7.3	The genetic information in DNA is passed from generation to generation and can be used to understand evolutionary relationships.
7.4.1.5.8.1	learning outcomes
7.4.1.5.9.1	You should be able to:
7.4.1.5.10.1	Explain how purines and pyrimidines differ.
7.4.1.5.11.1	Explain how biological information is encoded in DNA.
7.4.1.5.12.1	Identify cellular functions of nucleotides other than information processing.
7.4.1.5.13.1	What are the key differences between purines and pyrimidines and how does this relate to the structure of DNA?
7.4.1.5.14.1	How can DNA molecules be very diverse, even though they appear to be structurally similar?
7.4.1.5.15.1	Single-stranded nucleic acids about 25 bases long are called aptamers.
7.4.1.5.15.2	Because many sequences are possible, particular aptamers can be used to bind to specific targets, either as drugs to a protein target or for quantitating a small molecule in tissues or fluids.
7.4.1.5.15.3	How can aptamers have such diversity and specificity for binding?
7.4.1.5.16.1	We have seen that the nucleic acids RNA and DNA carry the blueprint of life, and that the inheritance of these macromolecules reaches back to the beginning of evolutionary time.
7.4.1.5.16.2	But when, where, and how did nucleic acids arise on Earth?
7.4.1.5.16.3	How did the building blocks of life, such as amino acids and sugars, originally arise?

7.4.2.7.1	You learned in Chapter 2 that living things are composed of the same elements as the inanimate universe (e. g. , C, H, O, P, N, and S).
7.4.2.7.2	But usually the arrangements of these atoms into molecules are unique in biological systems.
7.4.2.7.3	You will not find biological molecules such as proteins in nonliving matter unless they came from a once-living organism.
7.4.2.8.1	focus your learning
7.4.2.9.1	Experimental evidence was used to refute the idea that life could arise from nonliving materials.
7.4.2.10.1	Water did not always exist on Earth, and its presence on Earth was necessary before life could arise.
7.4.2.11.1	Experimental evidence supports the theory that life evolved as the result of chemical and physical changes on early Earth.
7.4.2.12.1	Evidence discovered in meteorites and on Mars raises questions about whether life evolved on bodies other than Earth.
7.4.2.1.1.1	We can   t know for certain how life on Earth began.
7.4.2.1.1.2	But one thing is sure: life (or at least life as we know it) is not constantly being restarted.
7.4.2.1.1.3	That is, spontaneous generation of life from inanimate nature is not happening repeatedly before our eyes.
7.4.2.1.1.4	Now and in the past, all life has come from life that existed before.
7.4.2.1.1.5	But people, including scientists, did not always believe this.
7.4.2.1.2.1	Many cultures and religions have suggested that life can arise repeatedly from nonliving matter.
7.4.2.1.2.2	During the European Renaissance (from the fourteenth to seventeenth centuries, a period that witnessed the birth of modern science), most people thought that at least some forms of life arose repeatedly and directly from inanimate or decaying matter by spontaneous generation.
7.4.2.1.2.3	People thought, for example, that mice arose from sweaty clothes placed in dim light; that frogs sprang directly from moist soil; and that rotting meat produced flies.
7.4.2.1.2.4	One scientist who doubted these assumptions was the Italian physician and poet Francesco Redi.
7.4.2.1.2.5	Redi hypothesized that flies arose not by some mysterious transformation of decaying meat, but from other flies that laid their eggs on the meat.
7.4.2.1.2.6	In 1668, Redi performed a scientific experiment   a relatively new concept at the time   to test his hypothesis.
7.4.2.1.2.7	He set out three jars containing chunks of meat:
7.4.2.1.3.1	One jar contained meat exposed to both air and flies.
7.4.2.1.4.1	A second jar was covered with a fine cloth so that the meat was exposed to air but not to flies.
7.4.2.1.5.1	The third jar was sealed with a lid so the meat was exposed to neither air nor flies.
7.4.2.1.6.1	As he had hypothesized, Redi found maggots, which then hatched into flies, only in the first jar.
7.4.2.1.6.2	This finding demonstrated that maggots could occur only where flies were present before.
7.4.2.1.6.3	The idea that a complex organism like a fly could appear spontaneously from a nonliving substance in the meat, or from &#x201C;something in the air,&#x201D; was laid to rest.
7.4.2.1.6.4	Well, perhaps not quite to rest.
7.4.2.1.7.1	In the 1660s, the newly invented microscope revealed a vast biological world that had never been seen before.
7.4.2.1.7.2	Virtually every environment on Earth was found to be teeming with tiny organisms.
7.4.2.1.7.3	Some scientists believed these organisms arose spontaneously from their rich chemical environment, by the action of a &#x201C;life force. &#x201D; But experiments in the nineteenth century by the great French scientist Louis Pasteur showed that microorganisms can arise only from other microorganisms, and that an environment without life remains lifeless (Figure 4.6).

7.4.2.1.11.1	Previous experiments disproving the spontaneous generation of larger organisms were called into question when microorganisms were discovered.
7.4.2.1.11.2	Louis Pasteur   s classic experiments disproved the spontaneous generation of microorganisms.
7.4.2.1.12.1	HYPOTHESIS Microorganisms come only from other microorganisms and cannot arise by spontaneous generation. .
7.4.2.1.13.1	METHOD
7.4.2.1.14.1	RESULTSMicrobial life grows only in the flasks exposed to microorganisms.
7.4.2.1.14.2	There is no &#x201C;spontaneous generation&#x201D; of life in the sterile flask.
7.4.2.1.15.1	CONCLUSION Living organisms arise from preexisting living organisms.
7.4.2.1.16.1	Pasteur   s and Redi   s experiments showed that living organisms cannot arise from nonliving materials under the conditions that exist on Earth now.
7.4.2.1.16.2	But their experiments did not prove that spontaneous generation never occurred.
7.4.2.1.16.3	Eons ago, conditions on Earth and in the atmosphere above it were vastly different than they are today.
7.4.2.1.16.4	Indeed, conditions similar to those found on primitive Earth may have existed, or may exist now, on other bodies in our solar system and elsewhere.
7.4.2..title.1.1	As we emphasized in Chapter 2, water is an essential component of life as we know it.
7.4.2..title.1.2	This is why there was great excitement when remotely controlled spacecraft sent from Earth detected water ice on Mars.
7.4.2..title.1.3	Astronomers believe our solar system began forming about 4.6 billion years ago, when a star exploded and collapsed to form the sun and about 500 bodies called planetesimals.
7.4.2..title.1.4	These planetesimals collided with one another to form the inner planets, including Earth and Mars.
7.4.2..title.1.5	The first chemical signatures indicating the presence of life on Earth are about 4 billion years old.
7.4.2..title.1.6	So it took 600 million years for the chemical conditions on Earth to become just right for life.
7.4.2..title.1.7	Key among those conditions was the presence of water.
7.4.2..title.2.1	Ancient Earth probably had a lot of water high in its atmosphere.
7.4.2..title.2.2	But the new planet was hot, and the water remained in vapor form and dissipated into space.
7.4.2..title.2.3	As Earth cooled, it became possible for water to condense on the planet   s surface   but where did that water come from?
7.4.2..title.2.4	One current view is that comets (loose agglomerations of dust and ice that have orbited the sun since the planets formed) struck Earth and Mars repeatedly, bringing to those planets not only water but also other chemical components of life, such as nitrogen and carbon-containing molecules.
7.4.2..title.3.1	As the planets cooled and chemicals from their crusts dissolved in the water, simple chemical reactions would have taken place.
7.4.2..title.3.2	Some of these reactions might have led to life, but impacts by large comets and rocky meteorites released enough energy to heat the developing oceans almost to boiling, thus destroying any early life that might have existed.
7.4.2..title.3.3	On Earth, these large impacts eventually subsided, and around 3.8 billion years ago, life gained a foothold.
7.4.2..title.3.4	There has been life on Earth ever since.
7.4.2..title.4.1	Several models have been proposed to explain the origin of life on Earth.
7.4.2..title.4.2	The next sections will discuss two alternative theories: that life arose on Earth through chemical evolution, or that life came from outside Earth.
7.4.2.3.1.1	One theory for the origin of life on Earth, chemical evolution, holds that conditions on primitive Earth led to the formation of simple molecules such as monomers (see Key Concept 3.1), and that these molecules led to the formation of life forms.
7.4.2.3.1.2	Scientists have sought to reconstruct those primitive conditions, both physically (by varying temperature) and chemically (by re-creating the mixes of elements that may have been present).
7.4.2.13.1.1	In oxygenated water, some trace metals such as molybdenum and rhenium are soluble, and their presence in sediments under oceans and lakes is directly proportional to the amount of oxygen gas (O2) that was present in and above the water at the times the rocks were formed.
7.4.2.13.1.2	Measurements of dated sedimentary cores indicate that none of these rare metals was present prior to 2.5 billion years ago.
7.4.2.13.1.3	This and other lines of evidence suggest that there was little O2 in Earth   s early atmosphere.
7.4.2.13.1.4	Oxygen gas is thought to have accumulated about 2.5 billion years ago as the by-product of photosynthesis by single-celled life forms; today 21 percent of our atmosphere is O2.
7.4.2.13.2.1	In the 1950s Stanley Miller and Harold Urey at the University of Chicago set up an experimental &#x201C;atmosphere&#x201D; containing the  gases they thought were present in Earth   s early atmosphere: hydrogen gas, ammonia, methane gas, and water vapor.
7.4.2.13.2.2	They passed an electrical spark through these gases to simulate lightning, a source of energy to drive chemical reactions.
7.4.2.13.2.3	Then they cooled the system so the gases would condense and collect in a watery solution, or &#x201C;ocean&#x201D; (Figure 4.7).
7.4.2.13.2.4	After a week of continuous operation, the system contained numerous organic molecules, including a variety of amino acids   the building blocks of proteins.

7.4.2.13.8.1	HYPOTHESIS Organic chemical compounds can be generated under conditions similar to those that existed in the atmosphere of primitive Earth.
7.4.2.13.9.1	METHOD
7.4.2.13.10.1	RESULTS
7.4.2.13.11.1	CONCLUSION The chemical building blocks of life could have been generated in the probable atmosphere of early Earth.
7.4.2.14.1.1	Stanley Miller also performed a long-term experiment in which the electrical spark was not used.
7.4.2.14.1.2	In 1972 he filled test tubes with ammonia gas, water vapor, and cyanide (HCN), another molecule that is thought to have formed on primitive Earth.
7.4.2.14.1.3	After checking that there were no contaminating substances or organisms that might confound the results, he sealed the tubes and cooled them to    78  C, the temperature of the ice that covers Europa, one of Jupiter   s moons.
7.4.2.14.1.4	Opening the tubes 27 years later, Miller found amino acids and nucleotide bases.
7.4.2.14.1.5	Apparently, pockets of liquid water within the ice had allowed high concentrations of the starting materials to accumulate, thereby speeding up chemical reactions.
7.4.2.14.1.6	The important conclusion is that the cold water within ice on ancient Earth, and other celestial bodies such as Mars, Europa, and Enceladus (one of Saturn   s moons; satellite photos have revealed geysers of liquid water coming from its interior), may have provided environments for the prebiotic synthesis of molecules required for the subsequent formation of simple living systems.
7.4.2.14.2.1	The results of these experiments were profoundly important in giving weight to speculations about the chemical origin of life on Earth and elsewhere in the universe.
7.4.2.14.2.2	Decades of experimental work and critical evaluation followed Miller and Urey   s original experiments.
7.4.2.14.2.3	In science, an experiment and its results must be repeatable and be reinterpreted and refined as more knowledge accumulates.
7.4.2.14.2.4	For example, ideas about Earth   s original atmosphere have changed.
7.4.2.14.2.5	There is abundant evidence indicating that major volcanic eruptions occurred 4 billion years ago; these would have released carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the atmosphere.
7.4.2.14.2.6	Experiments using these gases in addition to the ones in the original Miller   Urey experiment have produced a more diverse list of organic products:
7.4.2.14.3.1	All five bases that are present in DNA and RNA (i. e. , A, T, C, G, and U)
7.4.2.14.4.1	All of the 20 amino acids used in protein synthesis
7.4.2.14.5.1	Many three- to six-carbon sugars
7.4.2.14.6.1	Certain fatty acids
7.4.2.14.7.1	Vitamin B6 (pantothenic acid, a component of coenzyme A)
7.4.2.14.8.1	Nicotinamide (part of NAD, which is involved in energy metabolism)
7.4.2.14.9.1	Carboxylic acids such as succinic and lactic acids (also involved in energy metabolism)
7.4.2.4.1.1	Figure 4.8  The Murchison Meteorite
7.4.2.4.2.1	In 1969 a remarkable event led to the discovery that a meteorite from space carried molecules that were characteristic of life on Earth.
7.4.2.4.2.2	On September 28 of that year, fragments of a meteorite fell around the town of Murchison, Australia.
7.4.2.4.2.3	Using gloves to avoid Earth-derived contamination, scientists immediately shaved off tiny pieces of the rock, put them in test tubes, and extracted them in water (Figure 4.8).
7.4.2.4.2.4	They found several of the molecules that are unique to life, including purines, pyrimidines, sugars, and ten amino acids.
7.4.2.4.3.1	Were these molecules truly brought from space as part of the meteorite, or did they get there after the rock landed on Earth?
7.4.2.4.3.2	There are a number of reasons to believe the molecules were not Earthly contaminants:
7.4.2.4.4.1	The scientists took great care to avoid contamination.
7.4.2.4.4.2	They used gloves and sterile instruments, took pieces from below the rock   s surface, and did their work very soon after the meteorite landed (they hoped before organisms from Earth could contaminate the samples).
7.4.2.4.5.1	Amino acids in most living organisms on Earth are L-amino acids; that is, the amino acids of living things are found in only one of the two possible optical isomeric forms (see Figure 3.2).
7.4.2.4.5.2	The amino acids in the meteorite, however, were a mixture of L- and D-isomers, with a slight majority of the L form.
7.4.2.4.5.3	Thus the amino acids in the meteorite were not likely to have come from a living organism on Earth.
7.4.2.4.6.1	In the story that opened Chapter 2, we described how the ratio of isotopes in a living organism reflects the ratio of the same isotopes in the environment where the organism lives.
7.4.2.4.6.2	The isotope ratios for carbon and hydrogen in the sugars from the meteorite were different from the ratios of those elements found on Earth.
7.4.2.4.7.1	More than 90 meteorites from Mars have been recovered on Earth.
7.4.2.4.7.2	Many show signs of water   for example, in minerals such as carbonates that are precipitated from aqueous solution.
7.4.2.4.7.3	Some also contain organic molecules that are the chemical signatures of life.
7.4.2.4.7.4	While the presence of such molecules suggests that these rocks once harbored life, it does not prove that there were living organisms in the rocks when they landed on Earth.
7.4.2.4.7.5	Many scientists find it hard to believe that an organism could survive thousands of years of traveling through space in a meteorite, followed by intense heat as the meteorite passed through Earth   s atmosphere.
7.4.2.4.7.6	But there is evidence that the heat at the centers of some meteorites may not have been extreme.
7.4.2.4.7.7	If this were the case, then a long interplanetary trip by living organisms might have been possible.
7.4.2.4.8.1	Life does not have to reach Earth from space to prove it exists elsewhere.
7.4.2.4.8.2	There is an ongoing search for life in celestial bodies.
7.4.2.4.8.3	For example, as mentioned in the opening story of this chapter, both orbiting satellites and vehicles probing the landscape of Mars search for conditions suitable for present or past life on Mars.
7.4.2.4.8.4	Perhaps the most dramatic attempt to discover life on Mars came in 1976, when NASA celebrated the 200th anniversary of the political independence of the United States by landing two stationary probes, or landers, called Viking 1 and Viking 2 on the planet.
7.4.2.4.8.5	Investigating Life: Can We Find Evidence of Life on Mars? describes how scientists on Earth directed onboard instruments to evaluate soil on Mars for signs of life.

7.4.2.4.20.1	While it   s challenging to design experiments in the lab here on Earth, imagine the challenge of designing experiments done remotely on Mars!
7.4.2.4.20.2	A team of biologists and chemists led by Levin and Straat sent instruments to Mars to test for the presence of life by measuring the emission of gases after nutrients were supplied to soils possibly containing Martian organisms.
7.4.2.4.20.3	A scoop was used to obtain a 0.2 mL sample of soil which was then placed in a sealed container.
7.4.2.4.20.4	The mixture was warmed to about 18oC (much higher than the surrounding Martian environment).
7.4.2.4.20.5	Radioactive nutrients (formate, glycolate, glycine, alanine, and lactate) with their carbon atoms labeled in 14C were added.
7.4.2.4.20.6	At intervals after nutrient injection, a radioactive detector was employed to test for the release of 14C radioactive gases.
7.4.2.4.21.1	QUESTIONS
7.4.2.4.22.1	Table A shows data from two of the experiments.
7.4.2.4.22.2	Plot the data as 14C radioactive gas versus Martian days after nutrient addition.
7.4.2.4.22.3	What can you conclude?
7.4.2.4.22.4	Laboratory experiments prior to the two Viking departures showed that the total radioactivity that could be released if all of the nutrients were completely converted to gases was 257,000 counts per minute (cpm).
7.4.2.4.22.5	Calculate the fraction of this that appeared in the Martian sample and comment on the result.
7.4.2.4.23.1	Table A shows data from Martian soil that had been heated for 3 h at 160  C before nutrient addition.
7.4.2.4.23.2	Plot these data on the same graph you made for Question 1.
7.4.2.4.23.3	What types of molecules are destroyed by heat, and how does this occur?
7.4.2.4.23.4	How do these data affect your conclusions from question 1?
7.4.2.4.24.1	Back on Earth, Ponnamperuma and colleagues simulated Martian soil by using a major component of Martian soil called hematite (Fe2O3) and added the nutrients in the same way as had been done in the Mars experiment.
7.4.2.4.24.2	Their results, including a preheated experiment, are shown in Table B. How do these results affect the conclusions you drew after considering Questions 1 and 2?

7.4.2.4.27.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.4.2.4.28.1	A distinctive aspect of living systems is their ability to use molecules from the environment to extract chemical energy for growth.
7.4.2.4.28.2	During this process, waste products are released.
7.4.2.4.28.3	You are familiar with this: you breathe in oxygen gas (O2), take in nutrients in food, and breathe out carbon dioxide (CO2).
7.4.2.4.28.4	Other organisms do not use O2 but take in other molecules.
7.4.2.4.28.5	In the Mars experiments, scientists directed the Viking landers to scoop up some Martian soil and then exposed it to seven organic molecules as nutrients, all of which can be formed in Miller   Urey experiments (e. g. , amino acids; see Figure 4.7).
7.4.2.4.28.6	The seven molecules were labeled with a radioisotope of carbon (14C).
7.4.2.4.28.7	After a period of exposure, a detector was used to measure any radioactive gases (possibly CO2) produced.
7.4.2.4.29.1	The results of some of the experiments were astonishing: radioactive gas was detected in some experiments, and some scientists concluded that there might be life on Mars.
7.4.2.4.29.2	The fact that there was little radioactive gas produced when the soil was preheated to 160  C to kill living organisms gave credence to this conclusion.
7.4.2.4.29.3	Later, simulations in the lab on Earth showed that radioactive gas could could be formed in this experiment with certain kinds of soils, without organisms.
7.4.2.4.29.4	So there is an alternative, nonbiological explanation for the Mars data.
7.4.2.4.29.5	Nevertheless, some biologists still adhere to the biological explanation for the Mars data, and the quest for life on Mars continues.
7.4.2.4.30.1	4.2 recap
7.4.2.4.31.1	Life does not arise repeatedly through spontaneous generation, but comes from preexisting life.
7.4.2.4.31.2	Water is an essential ingredient for the emergence of life.
7.4.2.4.31.3	Chemical synthesis experiments provide support for the idea that life   s simple molecules formed in the prebiotic environment on Earth.
7.4.2.4.31.4	Meteorites that have landed on Earth provide some evidence for an extraterrestrial origin of life, as do experiments with landers on Mars showing possible chemical interconversions that may reflect life.
7.4.2.4.32.1	learning outcomes
7.4.2.4.33.1	You should be able to:
7.4.2.4.34.1	Explain how Redi   s and Pasteur   s experiments disproved spontaneous generation.
7.4.2.4.35.1	Describe conditions on early Earth and theories about how these conditions affected the origin of life on Earth.
7.4.2.4.36.1	Justify the conditions used by Miller and Urey in their experiments.
7.4.2.4.37.1	What conditions existing on Earth today might preclude the origin of life from the prebiotic molecules Miller and Urey used?
7.4.2.4.38.1	The interpretation of Pasteur   s experiment (see Figure 4.6) depended on the inactivation of microorganisms by heat.
7.4.2.4.38.2	We now know of microorganisms that can survive extremely high temperatures (see Chapter 26).
7.4.2.4.38.3	Does this change the interpretation of Pasteur   s experiment?
7.4.2.4.38.4	What experiments would you do to inactivate such microbes?
7.4.2.4.39.1	The Miller   Urey experiment (see Figure 4.7) showed that it was possible for amino acids to be formed from gases that were hypothesized to have been in Earth   s early atmosphere.
7.4.2.4.39.2	These amino acids were dissolved in water.
7.4.2.4.39.3	Knowing what you do about the polymerization of amino acids into proteins (see Figure 3.6), how would you set up an experiment to show that proteins can form under the conditions of early Earth?
7.4.2.4.40.1	Chemistry experiments modeling the conditions of ancient Earth provide clues about the origins of the monomers (such as amino acids) that make up the polymers (such as proteins) that characterize life.

7.4.2.4.42.1	4.3  The Large Molecules of Life Originated from Small Molecules
7.4.3.1.1	Complex molecules could be formed from simpler ones on primitive Earth
7.4.3.2.1	RNA may have been the first biological catalyst
7.4.3.3.1	The Miller   Urey experiment and others that followed provide a plausible scenario for the formation of the building blocks of life under conditions that prevailed on primitive Earth.
7.4.3.3.2	The next step in forming and supporting a general theory on the origin of life would be an explanation for how polymers formed from these monomers.
7.4.3.4.1	focus your learning
7.4.3.5.1	Evidence from simulation experiments supports the theory that biological polymers formed from chemical reactions taking place in early Earth conditions.
7.4.3.6.1	Scientists hypothesize that the presence of catalysts would have been necessary during the evolution of biological polymers.
7.4.3.1.1.1	Scientists have used a number of model systems to try to simulate conditions under which the first biological polymers might have been made.
7.4.3.1.1.2	Each of these systems is based on several observations and speculations:
7.4.3.1.2.1	Solid mineral surfaces, such as powderlike clays, have large surface areas.
7.4.3.1.2.2	Scientists speculate that the silicates in clay may have catalyzed (sped up) the condensation reactions that resulted in organic polymers.
7.4.3.1.3.1	Hydrothermal vents deep in the ocean, where hot water emerges from beneath Earth   s crust, lack oxygen gas and contain metals such as iron and nickel.
7.4.3.1.3.2	In laboratory experiments, these metals have been shown to catalyze the polymerization of amino acids in the absence of oxygen.
7.4.3.1.4.1	In hot pools at the edges of oceans, evaporation may have concentrated monomers to the point where polymerization was favored (the &#x201C;primordial soup&#x201D; hypothesis).
7.4.3.1.5.1	In whatever ways the earliest stages of chemical evolution occurred, they resulted in the emergence of monomers and polymers that have probably remained unchanged in their general structures and functions for several billion years.
7.4.3.2.1.1	Many chemical changes occur in living organisms: an example is DNA replication, which we described earlier in this chapter as the process by which a molecule of DNA is duplicated (see Figure 4.5).
7.4.3.2.1.2	Many other chemical changes occur in living systems, often involving the hydrolysis or synthesis of macromolecules or conversions among small molecules.
7.4.3.2.1.3	As you will see in Chapter 8, these chemical changes can occur spontaneously in aqueous solutions like those that exist in biological systems, but most would occur extremely slowly.
7.4.3.2.1.4	Catalysts   molecules that speed up biochemical conversions   solve this problem.
7.4.3.2.1.5	So a key to the origin of life is the appearance of catalysts.
7.4.3.2.2.1	Today, the main catalysts in organisms are proteins called enzymes.
7.4.3.2.2.2	The many shapes of proteins allow them to bind to diverse substances in solution and speed up chemical reactions.
7.4.3.2.2.3	But we know that proteins are made based on information in nucleic acids.
7.4.3.2.2.4	So we have a chicken-or-egg problem: If proteins are needed for life, nucleic acids must have appeared first, so that the proteins could be made.
7.4.3.2.2.5	But if nucleic acids appeared before proteins, proteins could not have been the first catalysts.
7.4.3.2.2.6	Could nucleic acids be catalysts, in addition to their role as blueprints for protein synthesis?
7.4.3.2.2.7	The answer is yes.
7.4.3.2.3.1	Like a protein, the three-dimensional structure of a folded RNA molecule presents a unique surface to the external environment (see Figure 4.3).
7.4.3.2.3.2	The surfaces of RNA molecules can be every bit as specific as those of proteins.
7.4.3.2.3.3	The three-dimensional shapes and other chemical properties of certain RNA molecules allow them to function as catalysts.
7.4.3.2.3.4	Catalytic RNAs, called ribozymes, can speed up reactions involving their own nucleotides as well as other cellular substances.
7.4.3.2.3.5	Although in retrospect it is not too surprising, the discovery of catalytic RNAs was a surprise to a community of biologists who were convinced that all biological catalysts were proteins (enzymes).
7.4.3.2.3.6	It took almost a decade for the work of the scientists involved, Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman, to be fully accepted by other scientists, but when it was, the two were awarded the Nobel Prize.
7.4.3.2.3.7	Figure 4.9  The &#x201C;RNA World&#x201D; Hypothesis
7.4.3.2.4.1	Given that RNA can be both informational (in its nucleotide sequence) and catalytic (because of its ability to form unique threedimensional shapes), it has been hypothesized that early life consisted of an &#x201C;RNA world&#x201D;&#x2014;a world before DNA.
7.4.3.2.4.2	It is thought that when RNA was first made, it could have acted as a catalyst for its own replication as well as for the synthesis of proteins.
7.4.3.2.4.3	DNA could eventually have evolved from RNA (Figure 4.9).
7.4.3.2.4.4	Several lines of evidence support this scenario:
7.4.3.2.5.1	In living organisms today, the formation of peptide linkages (see Figure 3.6) is catalyzed by ribozymes.
7.4.3.2.6.1	In certain viruses called retroviruses, there is an enzyme called reverse transcriptase that catalyzes the synthesis of DNA from RNA.
7.4.3.2.7.1	When a short, naturally occurring RNA molecule is added to a mixture of nucleotides, RNA polymers are formed at a rate 7 million times greater than the formation of polymers without the added RNA.
7.4.3.2.7.2	This indicates that the added RNA is a catalyst, not just a template.
7.4.3.2.8.1	An artificial ribozyme has been developed that can catalyze the assembly of short RNAs into a longer molecule that is an exact copy of itself.
7.4.3.2.8.2	This may be how nucleic acid replication evolved.
7.4.3.2.9.1	An artificial ribozyme has been developed that can catalyze the assembly of short RNAs into a longer molecule that is an exact copy of itself.
7.4.3.2.9.2	This may be how nucleic acid replication evolved.
7.4.3.2.10.1	4.3 recap
7.4.3.2.11.1	The formation of the large polymers that are characteristic of life may have occurred on the surfaces of clay particles, near hydrothermal vents, or in hot pools at the edges of oceans.
7.4.3.2.11.2	RNA may have been the first genetic material and catalyst.
7.4.3.2.12.1	learning outcomes
7.4.3.2.13.1	You should be able to:
7.4.3.2.14.1	Justify the need for catalysts in the origin of life.
7.4.3.2.15.1	Describe the proposed role for RNA in the formation of long-chain polymers.
7.4.3.2.16.1	Provide evidence supporting RNA as a catalyst in prebiotic chemical reactions that gave rise to other biological polymers.
7.4.3.2.17.1	Why was the ability to both encode information and catalyze reactions important for the origin of life?
7.4.3.2.18.1	Why was the discovery of ribozymes important for the development of the &#x201C;RNA world&#x201D; hypothesis?
7.4.3.2.19.1	In living organisms, the catalyst for the formation of the peptide bond is an RNA that does not have an informational role.
7.4.3.2.19.2	How does this relate to the &#x201C;RNA world&#x201D; hypothesis?
7.4.3.2.20.1	The discovery of mechanisms for the formation of small and large molecules is essential to answering questions about the origin of life on Earth.
7.4.3.2.20.2	But we also need to understand how organized living systems formed.
7.4.3.2.20.3	Such systems display the characteristic properties of life, including reproduction, energy processing, and responsiveness to the environment.
7.4.3.2.20.4	These are properties of cells, whose origin we will explore in the next section.
7.4.3.2.21.1	Chapter 4 continues with
7.4.3.2.22.1	4.4  Cells Originated from Their Molecular Building Blocks
7.4.4.1.1	How did the first cells with membranes come into existence?
7.4.4.2.1	Some ancient cells left a fossil imprint
7.4.4.3.1	As you have seen from many of the theories on the origin of life, the evolution of biochemistry occurred under localized conditions.
7.4.4.3.2	That is, the chemical reactions of life could not occur in a dilute aqueous environment with the molecular participants far apart.
7.4.4.3.3	There had to be a compartment of some sort that brought together and concentrated the compounds involved in these events.
7.4.4.3.4	Biologists have proposed that initially this compartment may have simply been a tiny droplet of water on the surface of a rock.
7.4.4.3.5	But another major event in the origin of life was necessary: the evolution of the cell membrane.
7.4.4.4.1	focus your learning
7.4.4.5.1	Membrane development was critical for the evolution of the cell as the smallest unit of life.
7.4.4.6.1	Scientists have discovered fossils of structures that may have been early cells.
7.4.4.7.1	Life as we know it is separated from the environment within structurally defined units called cells.
7.4.4.7.2	The internal contents of a cell are separated from the nonbiological environment by a special barrier   a membrane.
7.4.4.7.3	The membrane is not just a barrier; it regulates what goes into and out of the cell, as we will describe in Chapter 6.
7.4.4.7.4	This role of the surface membrane is very important because it permits the interior of the cell to maintain a chemical composition that is different from that of its external environment.
7.4.4.1.1.1	Jack Szostak and his colleagues at Harvard University built a laboratory model that gives insights into the origin of cells.
7.4.4.1.1.2	To do this, they first put fatty acids (which can be made in prebiotic experiments) into water.
7.4.4.1.1.3	Recall from Chapter 3 that fatty acids are amphipathic: they have a hydrophilic polar head and a long, nonpolar tail that is hydrophobic (see Figure 3.22).
7.4.4.1.1.4	When placed in water, fatty acids will arrange themselves in a round    huddle  ? much like a football team: the hydrophilic heads point outward to interact with the aqueous environment, and the fatty acid tails point inward, away from the water molecules.
7.4.4.1.1.5	Figure 4.10 Protocells
7.4.4.1.2.1	What if some water becomes trapped in the interior of this    huddle  ??
7.4.4.1.2.2	Now the layer of hydrophobic fatty acid tails is in water, which is an unstable situation.
7.4.4.1.2.3	To stabilize this structure, a second layer of fatty acids forms.
7.4.4.1.2.4	This lipid bilayer has the polar heads of the fatty acids facing both outward and inward, because they are attracted to the polar water molecules present on each side of the double layer.
7.4.4.1.2.5	The nonpolar tails form the interior of the bilayer (Figure 4.10).
7.4.4.1.2.6	These prebiotic, water-filled structures, defined by a lipid bilayer membrane, very much resemble living cells.
7.4.4.1.2.7	Scientists refer to these compartments as protocells.
7.4.4.1.2.8	Examining their properties revealed that:
7.4.4.1.3.1	Large molecules such as DNA and RNA could not pass through the bilayer to enter the protocells, but small molecules such as sugars and individual nucleotides could.
7.4.4.1.4.1	Nucleic acids inside the protocells could replicate using the nucleotides from outside.
7.4.4.1.4.2	When the investigators placed a short nucleic acid strand capable of self-replication inside protocells and added nucleotides to the watery environment outside, the nucleotides crossed the barrier, entered the protocells, and became incorporated into new polynucleotide chains.
7.4.4.1.4.3	This replication, which can occur without protein catalysis, may have been the first step toward cell reproduction.
7.4.4.1.5.1	Were these protocells truly cells, and was the lipid bilayer produced in these experiments a true cell membrane?
7.4.4.1.5.2	Certainly not.
7.4.4.1.5.3	The protocells could not fully reproduce, nor could they carry out all the metabolic reactions that take place in modern cells.
7.4.4.1.5.4	The simple lipid bilayer had few of the sophisticated functions of modern cell membranes.
7.4.4.1.5.5	Nevertheless, the *protocell may be a reasonable facsimile of a cell as it evolved billions of years ago:
7.4.4.1.6.1	It can act as an organized system of parts, with substances interacting and reacting, in some cases catalytically.
7.4.4.1.7.1	It includes an interior that is distinct from the exterior environment.
7.4.4.1.8.1	It is capable of limited replication.
7.4.4.1.9.1	These are all fundamental characteristics of living cells.
7.4.4.1.10.1	*connect the concepts Protocells more closely resemble bacteria than plant or animal cells.
7.4.4.1.10.2	The evolution of the latter two cell types is believed to have occurred in a series of steps, as explained in Key Concept 26.1.
7.4.4.2.1.1	Figure 4.11 The Earliest Cells?
7.4.4.2.2.1	In the 1990s scientists made a rare find: a formation of ancient rocks in Australia that had remained relatively unchanged since the rocks first formed 3.5 billion years ago.
7.4.4.2.2.2	In one of these rock samples, geologist J. William Schopf of the University of California, Los Angeles, saw chains and clumps of what looked tantalizingly like contemporary cyanobacteria, or    blue-green  ? bacteria (Figure 4.11).
7.4.4.2.2.3	Cyanobacteria are believed to have been among the first organisms because they can perform photosynthesis, converting CO2 and water into carbohydrates.
7.4.4.2.2.4	Schopf needed to prove that the chains were once alive, not just the results of simple chemical reactions.
7.4.4.2.2.5	He and his colleagues looked for chemical evidence of photosynthesis in the rock samples.
7.4.4.2.3.1	The use of carbon dioxide in photosynthesis is a hallmark of life and leaves a unique chemical signature   a specific ratio of carbon isotopes (13C:12C) in the resulting carbohydrates.
7.4.4.2.3.2	Schopf showed that the Australian material had this isotope signature.
7.4.4.2.3.3	Furthermore, microscopic examination of the chains revealed internal substructures that are characteristic of living systems and were not likely to be the result of simple chemical reactions.
7.4.4.2.3.4	Schopf   s evidence suggests that the Australian sample is indeed the remains of a truly ancient living organism.
7.4.4.2.4.1	In 2011 a different team of scientists, working about 32 km from Schopf   s discovery, found similar-looking microfossil structures in sandstone rocks that were about 3.4 billion years old.
7.4.4.2.4.2	In this case, a chemical analysis of the rocks indicated that these cells used sulfur instead of oxygen in the series of cellular reactions that release chemical energy.
7.4.4.2.4.3	Figure 4.12 The Origin of Life
7.4.4.2.5.1	Taking geological, chemical, and biological evidence into account, it is plausible that it took about 500 million to a billion years from the formation of Earth until the appearance of the first cells (Figure 4.12).
7.4.4.2.5.2	Life has been cellular ever since.
7.4.4.2.5.3	In the next chapter we will begin our study of cell structure and function.
7.4.4.2.6.1	investigatinglife
7.4.4.2.7.1	Can we find evidence of life on Mars?
7.4.4.2.8.1	In 2014, NASA declared that finding evidence for current or past life on Mars is a primary goal.
7.4.4.2.8.2	At this writing, the Curiosity rover is still there, doing experiments and analyses.
7.4.4.2.8.3	Later rovers are planned for early in the coming decade.
7.4.4.2.8.4	In addition, the European Space Agency, collaborating with Russia, is planning to launch several    ExoMars  ? rovers in the middle of the decade, which will drill 2 m into the surface of Mars to get cores to analyze them for chemical traces of life below the surface.
7.4.4.2.8.5	Most exciting, although uncertain, is a Mars Sample Return Mission, in which soil samples will be brought back to Earth for careful experimentation and analysis in laboratories, just as samples from the moon were brought back more than 40 years ago.
7.4.4.2.8.6	If you had a Martian soil sample here on Earth, what analyses and experiments would you perform?
7.4.4.2.9.1	Future directions
7.4.4.2.10.1	A daring space mission is in the final planning stages that may provide key information on the origin of life on Earth.
7.4.4.2.10.2	There are more than 600,000 known asteroids, most of them rocks from the early solar system orbiting the sun between Mars and Jupiter.
7.4.4.2.10.3	But a few thousand have been kicked out of the typical location and are relatively near Earth, some getting closer than our moon.
7.4.4.2.10.4	One, called Bennu, was discovered in 1999 and has been well studied.
7.4.4.2.10.5	It is just the right size and composition to contain organic molecules.
7.4.4.2.10.6	In 2018, a probe called OSIRIS-REx will arrive at the asteroid, spend about a year near it, and collect a sample of material and then return it to Earth in 2023 for analysis.
7.4.4.2.10.7	This sample of the early solar system will provide scientists with a window onto not just what the asteroid is made of, but perhaps the earliest molecules that could have led to life.
7.4.4.2.11.1	4.4 recap
7.4.4.2.12.1	The chemical reactions that preceded living organisms probably occurred in specialized compartments, such as water droplets on the surfaces of minerals.
7.4.4.2.12.2	Life as we know it did not begin until the emergence of cells.
7.4.4.2.12.3	Protocells made in the laboratory have some of the properties of modern cells.
7.4.4.2.12.4	Cell-like structures fossilized in ancient rocks date early cells to about 3.5 billion years ago.

7.4.summary.2.1	Nucleic Acid Structures Reflect Their Function
7.4.summary.3.1	The unique functions of the nucleic acids   DNA and RNA   are information storage and transfer.
7.4.summary.3.2	DNA is the hereditary material that passes genetic information from one generation to the next, and RNA uses that information to specify the structures of proteins.
7.4.summary.4.1	Nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides.
7.4.summary.4.2	A nucleotide consists of a phosphate group, a pentose sugar (ribose in RNA and deoxyribose in DNA), and a nitrogen-containing base.
7.4.summary.4.3	Review Figure 4.1, Animation 4.1
7.4.summary.5.1	In DNA, the nucleotide bases are adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T).
7.4.summary.5.2	Uracil (U) replaces thymine in RNA.
7.4.summary.5.3	C, T, and U have single-ring structures and are pyrimidines.
7.4.summary.5.4	A and G have double-ring structures and are purines.
7.4.summary.6.1	The nucleotides in DNA and RNA are joined by phosphodiester linkages involving the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, forming a nucleic acid polymer.
7.4.summary.6.2	Review Figure 4.2, Activity 4.1
7.4.summary.7.1	Complementary base pairing due to hydrogen bonds between A and T, A and U, and G and C occurs in nucleic acids.
7.4.summary.7.2	In RNA, the hydrogen bonds result in a folded molecule.
7.4.summary.7.3	In DNA, the hydrogen bonds connect two strands into a double helix.
7.4.summary.7.4	Review Figure 4.3,  Focus: Key Figure 4.4,  Activity 4.2
7.4.summary.8.1	The information content of DNA and RNA resides in their base sequences.
7.4.summary.9.1	The information in DNA is expressed as RNA in transcription.
7.4.summary.9.2	RNA can then specify the amino acid sequence of a protein in translation.

7.4.summary.10.1	The Small Molecules of Life Originated on Primitive Earth
7.4.summary.11.1	The historical belief that life can originate repeatedly by spontaneous generation was disproven experimentally.
7.4.summary.11.2	Review Figure 4.6, Animation 4.2
7.4.summary.12.1	A prerequisite for life is the presence of water.
7.4.summary.13.1	One hypothesis for the origin of life on Earth is chemical evolution: the idea that organic molecules were formed on Earth before life began.
7.4.summary.14.1	Chemical experiments modeling the prebiotic conditions on Earth support the idea of chemical evolution.
7.4.summary.14.2	Review Figure 4.7, Animation 4.3
7.4.summary.15.1	Some meteorites that have landed on Earth contain organic molecules, suggesting that life might have originated extraterrestrially.

7.4.summary.17.1	The Large Molecules of Life Originated from Small Molecules
7.4.summary.18.1	Chemical evolution may have led to the polymerization of small molecules into polymers.
7.4.summary.18.2	This may have occurred on the surfaces of clay particles, in hydrothermal vents, or in hot pools at the edges of oceans.
7.4.summary.19.1	A catalyst speeds up a chemical reaction.
7.4.summary.19.2	Today most catalysts are proteins, but some RNA molecules can function as both catalysts and information molecules.
7.4.summary.19.3	A catalytic RNA is called a ribozyme.
7.4.summary.20.1	The existence of ribozymes supports the idea of an &#x201C;RNA world&#x201D;&#x2014;a world before DNA.
7.4.summary.20.2	On early Earth, RNA may have acted as a catalyst for its own replication as well as for the synthesis of proteins.
7.4.summary.20.3	DNA could eventually have evolved from RNA.
7.4.summary.20.4	Review Figure 4.9
7.4.summary.21.1	In support of the &#x201C;RNA world&#x201D; hypothesis, an artificial self-replicating ribozyme was developed in the laboratory.

7.5.3.1	Key Concepts:
7.5.4.1	Cells Are the Fundamental Units of Life
7.5.5.1	Prokaryotic Cells Are the Simplest Cells
7.5.6.1	Eukaryotic Cells Contain Organelles
7.5.7.1	Extracellular Structures Have Important Roles
7.5.8.1	Eukaryotic Cells Evolved in Several Steps

7.5.10.1	Natural Sunscreen
7.5.11.1	Sunlight plays a key role in life, providing the energy that is transformed into stored chemical energy in green plants through the process of photosynthesis.
7.5.11.2	When we eat food, the energy stored in its chemical bonds ultimately came from the sun.
7.5.11.3	But sunlight has a nasty side effect: part of it, the highly energetic ultraviolet light, damages the genetic material, DNA.
7.5.11.4	Even without knowing this chemistry, some people take measures to minimize exposure to excess sunlight, either by staying in the shade or using chemical sunscreens.
7.5.11.5	But there is also a biological mechanism that has evolved to reduce the sun   s damage to organisms.
7.5.11.6	In most animals, dark brown or black chemical pigments called melanins are made inside cells, the basic units of life.
7.5.11.7	Melanins absorb ultraviolet light, thereby protecting DNA.
7.5.12.1	In humans, melanin is made in certain skin cells called melanocytes.
7.5.12.2	Humans first evolved in Africa, and the intense sunlight near the equator acted as an evolutionary selective agent for the development of large numbers of melanocytes.
7.5.12.3	As some of these dark-skinned people migrated to more northern regions where the sun is not as intense, the selection pressure for melanocytes was reduced, and over millennia, genetic changes leading to fewer melanocytes persisted in offspring, resulting in lighter skin.
7.5.12.4	Exposure to intense sunlight in these people results in the production of more melanin, the familiar tanning response.
7.5.13.1	Melanocytes are specialized cells.
7.5.13.2	You find them in the skin but not typically in internal organs.
7.5.13.3	We will return to the process of how different cells have different functions in later chapters.
7.5.13.4	But even inside the melanocyte, there is specialization.
7.5.13.5	Melanin is made inside a special cell compartment called the melanosome.
7.5.13.6	These compartments can be expelled from melanocytes and transferred to other skin cells, so they too become loaded with pigment.
7.5.13.7	This occurs spontaneously in dark-skinned people, while in paler people it is stimulated by exposure to intense sunlight.
7.5.14.1	The observation that the chemistry of life takes place within cells, and in some cases within specialized compartments in them, is a key concept of biological science.
7.5.15.1	Are pigments compartmentalized in all types of cells?
7.5.16.1	Chapter 5 continues with
7.5.17.1	5.1 Cells Are the Fundamental Units of Life
7.5.1.1.1	What is the cell theory?
7.5.1.2.1	Cell size is limited by the surface area-to-volume ratio
7.5.1.3.1	Microscopes reveal the features of cells
7.5.1.4.1	The cell membrane forms an outer boundary of every cell
7.5.1.5.1	Cells may be classified as either prokaryotic or eukaryotic
7.5.1.6.1	Chapter 1 introduced some of the characteristics of life: chemical complexity, growth and reproduction, the ability to refashion substances from the environment, and the ability to move specific substances into and out of the organism.
7.5.1.6.2	Cells have all of these characteristics.
7.5.1.6.3	Just as atoms are the building blocks of chemistry, cells are the building blocks of life.
7.5.1.7.1	focus your learning
7.5.1.8.1	Cell theory states that the cell is the smallest unit of life, that cells make up all living organisms, and that cells come from existing cells.
7.5.1.9.1	Microscopy allows visual examination of cells.
7.5.1.10.1	Membranes provide a structural role in a cell and also allow the cell to maintain homeostasis and communicate with other cells.
7.5.0.0.1.1	The cell theory is an important unifying principle of biology.
7.5.0.0.1.2	There are three components of the cell theory:
7.5.0.0.2.1	Cells are the fundamental units of life.
7.5.0.0.3.1	All living organisms are composed of cells.
7.5.0.0.4.1	All cells come from preexisting cells.
7.5.0.0.5.1	To the original cell theory, first stated in 1838, should be added:
7.5.0.0.6.1	Modern cells evolved from a common ancestor.
7.5.0.0.7.1	Cells contain water and other small and large molecules, which we examined in Chapters 2   4.
7.5.0.0.7.2	Each cell contains at least 10,000 different types of molecules, most of them present in many copies.
7.5.0.0.7.3	Cells use these molecules to transform matter and energy, to respond to their environments, and to reproduce.
7.5.0.0.7.4	The cell theory has three important implications:
7.5.0.0.8.1	Studying cell biology is in some sense the same as studying life.
7.5.0.0.8.2	The principles that underlie the functions of the single cell of a bacterium are similar to those governing the approximately 60 trillion human cells of your body.
7.5.0.0.9.1	Life is continuous.
7.5.0.0.9.2	All the cells in your body came from a single cell, a fertilized egg (zygote).
7.5.0.0.9.3	That zygote came from the fusion of two cells, a sperm and an egg, from your parents.
7.5.0.0.9.4	The cells of your parents    bodies were all derived from their parents, and so on back through generations and evolution to the initial cell.
7.5.0.0.10.1	The origin of life on Earth was marked by the origin of the first cells (see Chapter 4).
7.5.0.0.11.1	Even the largest creatures on Earth are composed of cells, but the cells themselves are usually too small for the naked eye to see.
7.5.0.0.11.2	Why are cells so small?
7.5.0.0.1.1	Most cells are tiny.
7.5.0.0.1.2	In 1665 Robert Hooke estimated that in 1 square inch of cork, which he examined under his magnifying lens, there were 1,259,712,000 cells!
7.5.0.0.1.3	The diameters of cells range from about 1 to 100 micrometers (  m).
7.5.0.0.1.4	There are some exceptions: the eggs of birds are large single cells, and individual cells of several types of algae and bacteria are large enough to be viewed with the unaided eye (Figure 5.1).
7.5.0.0.2.1	Figure 5.1 The Scale of Life
7.5.0.0.3.1	This logarithmic scale shows the relative sizes of molecules, cells, and multicellular organisms.
7.5.0.0.3.2	Figure 5.2 Why Cells Are Small
7.5.0.0.4.1	Small cell size is a practical necessity arising from the change in the surface area-to-volume ratio of any object as it increases in size.
7.5.0.0.4.2	As an object increases in volume, its surface area also increases, but not at the same rate (Figure 5.2).
7.5.0.0.4.3	This phenomenon has great biological significance.
7.5.0.0.4.4	To appreciate this point, let   s assume that the amount of chemical activity carried out by a cell is proportional to its volume.
7.5.0.0.4.5	The surface area of the cell determines the amount of substances that can enter it from the outside environment, and the amount of waste products that can exit to the environment.
7.5.0.0.5.1	As a living cell grows larger, its chemical activities, and thus its need for resources and its rate of waste production, increase faster than its surface area.
7.5.0.0.5.2	(The surface area, being two-dimensional, increases in proportion to the square of the radius, whereas the volume, being three-dimensional, increases much more   in proportion to the cube of the radius. )
7.5.0.0.5.3	In addition, substances must move from one site to another within the cell; the smaller the cell, the more easily this is accomplished.
7.5.0.0.5.4	This explains why large organisms must consist of many small cells: cells must be small in volume in order to maintain a large enough surface area-to-volume ratio and an ideal internal volume.
7.5.0.0.5.5	The large surface area represented by the many small cells of a multicellular organism enables it to carry out the many different functions required for survival.
7.5.0.0.1.1	Most cells are too small to be seen with the unaided eye.
7.5.0.0.1.2	Microscopes allow cells and details within them to be seen.
7.5.0.0.1.3	The property that allows detail to be seen is called resolution.
7.5.0.0.1.4	Formally defined, resolution is the minimum distance two objects can be apart and still be seen as two objects.
7.5.0.0.1.5	Resolution for the human eye is about 0.2 mm (200   m).
7.5.0.0.1.6	Most cells are much smaller than 200   m and thus are invisible to the human eye.
7.5.0.0.1.7	Microscopes magnify and increase resolution so that cells and their internal structures can be seen clearly (Figure 5.3).
7.5.0.0.2.1	research tools
7.5.0.0.3.1	Figure 5.3 Looking at Cells
7.5.0.0.4.1	The six images on this page show some techniques used in light microscopy.
7.5.0.0.4.2	The three images on the following page were created using electron microscopes.
7.5.0.0.4.3	All of these images are of a particular type of cultured cell known as HeLa cells.
7.5.0.0.5.1	Note that the images in most cases are flat, two-dimensional views.
7.5.0.0.5.2	As you look at images of cells, keep in mind that they are three-dimensional structures.
7.5.0.0.6.1	There are two basic types of microscopes   light microscopes and electron microscopes   that use different forms of radiation (see Figure 5.3).
7.5.0.0.6.2	While the resolution is better in electron microscopy, only dead cells are visualized because they must be prepared in a vacuum.
7.5.0.0.6.3	Light microscopes, by contrast, can be used to visualize living cells (for example, by phase-contrast microscopy; see Figure 5.3).
7.5.0.0.7.1	Before we look at cell structure, it is useful to consider the many uses of microscopy.
7.5.0.0.7.2	Here is an example: an entire branch of medicine, pathology, makes use of many different methods of microscopy to aid in the analysis of cells and the diagnosis of diseases.
7.5.0.0.7.3	For instance, a surgeon might remove from a body some tissue suspected of being cancerous.
7.5.0.0.7.4	The pathologist might:
7.5.0.0.8.1	examine the tissue quickly by phase-contrast microscopy to determine the size, shape, and spread of the cells;
7.5.0.0.9.1	stain the tissue with a general dye and examine it by brightfield microscopy to bring out features such as the shapes of the nuclei, or cell division characteristics;
7.5.0.0.10.1	examine the tissue under the transmission electron microscope to observe internal structures such as the mitochondria or the chromatin (these are described in Key Concept 5.3);
7.5.0.0.11.1	stain the tissue with a specific dye and examine it by microscopy for the presence of proteins that are diagnostic of particular cancers.
7.5.0.0.11.2	The results can influence the choice of therapy.
7.5.0.0.1.1	While light microscopy shows many types of cells and even some structure inside them, the cell membrane is best observed with an electron microscope.
7.5.0.0.1.2	This very thin structure forms the outer boundary of the cytoplasm of every cell, and it has similar thickness and molecular structure in all cells.
7.5.0.0.1.3	You will learn about membranes in more detail in Chapter 6.
7.5.0.0.1.4	For now, keep in mind that (with the exception of some species of archaea discussed in Chapter 26) the cell membrane consists of a phospholipid bilayer (see Key Concept 3.4), and that a variety of proteins are embedded within the bilayer.
7.5.0.0.2.1	The membrane has several important roles:
7.5.0.0.3.1	The cell membrane acts as a selectively permeable barrier, preventing some substances from crossing it while permitting other substances to enter and leave the cell.
7.5.0.0.4.1	By regulating transport across it, the cell membrane allows the cell to maintain a more or less constant internal environment.
7.5.0.0.4.2	The maintenance of a constant internal environment (known as homeostasis) is a key characteristic of life and will be discussed in detail in Chapter 40.
7.5.0.0.5.1	As the cell   s boundary with the outside environment, the cell membrane is important in communicating with adjacent cells and receiving signals from the environment.
7.5.0.0.5.2	You will learn about this in Chapter 7.
7.5.0.0.6.1	The cell membrane often has proteins protruding from it that are responsible for binding and adhering to adjacent cells.
7.5.0.0.6.2	Thus the cell membrane plays an important structural role and contributes to cell shape.
7.5.0.0.1.1	As you saw in Key Concept 1.1, biologists classify all living things into three domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya.
7.5.0.0.1.2	The organisms in Archaea and Bacteria are collectively called prokaryotes, and they have in common a prokaryotic cell organization.
7.5.0.0.1.3	A prokaryotic cell does not typically have membrane-enclosed internal compartments; in particular, it does not have a nucleus.
7.5.0.0.1.4	The first cells were probably similar in organization to those of modern prokaryotes.
7.5.0.0.2.1	Eukaryotic cell organization is found in members of the domain Eukarya (eukaryotes), which includes the protists, plants, fungi, and animals.
7.5.0.0.2.2	In contrast to prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells contain membrane-enclosed compartments called organelles.
7.5.0.0.2.3	The most noticeable organelle is the cell nucleus, where most of the cell   s DNA is located and where gene expression begins:
7.5.0.0.3.1	Just as a cell is an enclosed compartment, separating its contents from the surrounding environment, so each organelle provides a compartment that separates molecules and biochemical reactions from the rest of the cell.
7.5.0.0.3.2	This    division of labor  ? provides possibilities for regulation and efficiency that were important in the evolution of complex organisms and helps explain the complexity of eukaryotic cells relative to prokaryotic cells.
7.5.0.0.4.1	5.1 recap
7.5.0.0.5.1	The cell theory is a unifying principle of biology.
7.5.0.0.5.2	Cell size is limited in order to maintain a high surface area-to-volume ratio.
7.5.0.0.5.3	Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are enclosed within a cell membrane, but prokaryotic cells lack the membrane-enclosed organelles that are found in eukaryotic cells.
7.5.0.0.6.1	learning outcomes
7.5.0.0.7.1	&#160;&#160;You should be able to:
7.5.0.0.8.1	List the three tenets of the original cell theory.
7.5.0.0.9.1	Explain the importance of membranes in cell function.
7.5.0.0.10.1	How does cell biology embody all the principles of life?
7.5.0.0.11.1	What is the importance of the cell membrane and the membranes that surround organelles?
7.5.0.0.12.1	As we mentioned in this section, there are two structural themes in cell architecture: prokaryotic and eukaryotic.
7.5.0.0.12.2	We will now turn to the organization of prokaryotic cells.
7.5.0.0.13.1	Chapter 5 continues with
7.5.0.0.14.1	5.2 Prokaryotic Cells Are the Simplest Cells
7.5.2.1.1	What are the features of prokaryotic cells?
7.5.2.2.1	Specialized features are found in some prokaryotes
7.5.2.3.1	Cell walls
7.5.2.4.1	Internal membranes
7.5.2.5.1	Flagella and Pili
7.5.2.6.1	Cytoskeleton
7.5.2.7.1	With diameters or lengths in the range of 1   10   m, prokaryotic cells are generally smaller than eukaryotic cells, whose diameters are usually in the range of 10   100   m. Each individual prokaryote is a single cell, but many types of prokaryotes form chains or small clusters of cells, and some occur in large clusters containing hundreds of cells.
7.5.2.7.2	In this section we will first consider the features shared by cells in the domains Bacteria and Archaea.
7.5.2.7.3	Then we will examine structural features that are found in some, but not all, prokaryotes.
7.5.2.8.1	focus your learning
7.5.2.9.1	All prokaryotic cells contain a cell membrane, nucleoid with DNA, cytoplasm, and ribosomes.
7.5.0.0.1.1	All *prokaryotic cells have the same basic structure (Figure 5.4):
7.5.0.0.2.1	The cell membrane encloses the cell, regulating the traffic of materials into and out of the cell, and separating its interior from the external environment.
7.5.0.0.3.1	The nucleoid is a region in the cell where the DNA is located.
7.5.0.0.3.2	As we described in Key Concept 4.1, DNA is the hereditary material that controls cell growth, maintenance, and reproduction.
7.5.0.0.4.1	The rest of the material enclosed in the cell membrane is called the cytoplasm (cytosol).
7.5.0.0.5.1	Ribosomes are complexes of RNA and proteins in the cytoplasm that are about 25 nanometers (nm) in diameter.
7.5.0.0.5.2	They can be visualized only with the electron microscope.
7.5.0.0.5.3	They are the sites of protein synthesis, where information coded for in nucleic acids directs the sequential linking of amino acids to form proteins.
7.5.0.0.6.1	*connect the concepts In terms of sheer numbers, prokaryotes are the most successful organisms on Earth.
7.5.0.0.6.2	As we examine prokaryotic cells in this section, bear in mind that there are vast numbers of prokaryotic species, and that bacteria and archaea are distinguished in numerous ways.
7.5.0.0.6.3	These differences, and the vast diversity of organisms in these two domains, will be the subject of Chapter 26.
7.5.0.0.7.1	The cytoplasm is not static.
7.5.0.0.7.2	Rather, the substances in this environment are in constant motion.
7.5.0.0.7.3	For example, a typical protein moves around the entire cell within a minute, and it collides with many other molecules along the way.
7.5.0.0.7.4	This motion helps ensure that biochemical reactions proceed at rates sufficient to meet the needs of the cell.
7.5.0.0.7.5	Although they are structurally less complex than eukaryotic cells, prokaryotic cells are functionally complex, carrying out thousands of biochemical reactions.
7.5.0.0.7.6	Figure 5.4 A Prokaryotic Cell
7.5.0.0.8.1	This electron micrograph and drawing of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa illustrate the typical structures shared by all prokaryotic cells.
7.5.0.0.8.2	In addition, this bacterium has a protective outer membrane that is not present in all prokaryotes.
7.5.0.0.8.3	The flagellum and capsule are also structures found in some, but not all, prokaryotic cells.
7.5.0.0.1.1	As they evolved, some prokaryotes developed specialized structures that gave them a selective advantage: cells with these structures were better able to survive and reproduce in particular environments than cells lacking them.
7.5.0.0.1.1	Most prokaryotes have a cell wall located outside the cell membrane.
7.5.0.0.1.2	The rigid wall supports the cell and determines its shape.
7.5.0.0.1.3	The cell walls of most bacteria, but not archaea, contain peptidoglycan, a polymer of amino sugars that is linked at regular intervals to short peptides.
7.5.0.0.1.4	Cross-linking among these peptides results in a single giant molecule around the entire cell.
7.5.0.0.1.5	In some bacteria, another layer, the outer membrane (a polysacchariderich phospholipid membrane), encloses the peptidoglycan layer (see Figure 5.4).
7.5.0.0.1.6	Unlike the cell membrane, this outer membrane is not a major barrier to the movement of molecules across it.
7.5.0.0.2.1	Enclosing the cell wall in some bacteria is a slimy layer composed mostly of polysaccharides and referred to as a capsule.
7.5.0.0.2.2	In some cases these capsules protect the bacteria from attack by white blood cells in the animals they infect.
7.5.0.0.2.3	Capsules also help keep the cells from drying out, and sometimes they help bacteria attach to other cells.
7.5.0.0.1.1	Some groups of bacteria   including the cyanobacteria   carry out photosynthesis: they use energy from the sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates.
7.5.0.0.1.2	These bacteria have an internal membrane system that contains molecules needed for photosynthesis.
7.5.0.0.1.3	The development of photosynthesis, which requires membranes, was an important event in the early evolution of life on Earth.
7.5.0.0.1.4	Other prokaryotes have internal membrane folds that are attached to the cell membrane.
7.5.0.0.1.5	These folds may function in cell division or in various energy-releasing reactions.
7.5.0.0.1.1	Some prokaryotes swim by using appendages called flagella, which sometimes look like tiny corkscrews (Figure 5.5A).
7.5.0.0.1.2	In bacteria, the filament of the flagellum is made of a protein called flagellin.
7.5.0.0.1.3	(As you will see in Key Concept 5.3, the flagella of eukaryotes are quite different in structure, but similar in function. )
7.5.0.0.1.4	A complex motor protein spins the bacterial flagellum on its axis like a propeller, driving the cell along.
7.5.0.0.1.5	The motor protein is anchored to the cell membrane and, in some bacteria, to the outer membrane of the cell wall (Figure 5.5B).
7.5.0.0.1.6	We know that the flagella cause the motion of cells because if they are removed, the cells do not move.
7.5.0.0.1.7	Figure 5.5 Prokaryotic Flagella
7.5.0.0.2.1	(A) Flagella contribute to the movement and adhesion of prokaryotic cells.
7.5.0.0.2.2	(B) Complex protein ring structures anchored in the cell membrane form a motor unit that rotates the flagellum and propels the cell.
7.5.0.0.3.1	Pili are structures made of protein that project from the surfaces of some types of bacterial cells.
7.5.0.0.3.2	These hairlike structures are shorter than flagella and are used for adherence.
7.5.0.0.3.3	Conjugative pili (sex pili) help bacteria join to one another to exchange genetic material.
7.5.0.0.3.4	Fimbriae are composed of the same proteins as pili but are shorter, and help cells adhere to surfaces such as animal cells, for food and protection.
7.5.0.0.1.1	The cytoskeleton is the collective name for protein filaments that play roles in cell division, cell movement, and in maintaining the shapes of cells.
7.5.0.0.1.2	One such protein forms a ring structure that constricts during cell division, whereas another forms helical structures that extend down the lengths of rod-shaped cells, helping maintain their shapes.
7.5.0.0.1.3	In the past it was thought that only eukaryotic cells had cytoskeletons (see Key Concept 5.3), but more recently, biologists have recognized that cytoskeletal components are also widely distributed among prokaryotes.
7.5.0.0.2.1	5.2 recap
7.5.0.0.3.1	Prokaryotic cells share basic features, including the cell membrane and a region called the nucleoid.
7.5.0.0.3.2	The rest of the material enclosed by the cell membrane, including the ribosomes, is called the cytoplasm.
7.5.0.0.3.3	Other features, such as cell walls, internal membranes, and flagella, are present in some but not all prokaryotes.

7.5.0.0.9.1	What are the chemical compositions of the nucleoid and cytoplasm in a prokaryotic cell?
7.5.0.0.10.1	As we have already noted, the prokaryotic cell is one of two types of cell recognized in cell biology.
7.5.0.0.10.2	The other is the eukaryotic cell.
7.5.0.0.10.3	Eukaryotic cells are more structurally and functionally complex than prokaryotic cells.

7.5.3.17.2	While these cells have distinctive structures and functions, they and other eukaryotic cells share many features, and it is these common features that we will discuss in this section.
7.5.3.18.1	focus your learning
7.5.3.19.1	Eukaryotic cells differ from prokaryotic cells in that they contain membrane-bound structures known as organelles.
7.5.3.20.1	Each organelle carries out a different specific function that, when combined with others, allows the cell to function as a whole.
7.5.3.21.1	Eukaryotic cells generally have lengths or diameters about ten times greater than those of prokaryotes.
7.5.3.21.2	Like prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells have a cell membrane, cytoplasm, and ribosomes.
7.5.3.21.3	Other structures in eukaryotic cells analogous to those in prokaryotes include a cytoskeleton composed of protein fibers and, outside the cell membrane, an extracellular matrix.
7.5.3.21.4	But as you learned earlier in this chapter, eukaryotic cells also have compartments within the cytoplasm that are separated by membranes.
7.5.0.0.1.1	The membranous compartments of eukaryotic cells are called organelles.
7.5.0.0.1.2	All eukaryotic cells have many organelles and structures in common; the most obvious is the cell nucleus.
7.5.0.0.1.3	But they also have some differences.
7.5.0.0.1.4	For example, many plant cells have chloroplasts that perform photosynthesis.
7.5.0.0.1.5	Each type of organelle has a specific role: some organelles have been characterized as factories that make specific products, whereas others are like power plants that take in energy in one form and convert it to a more useful form.
7.5.0.0.1.6	These functional roles are defined by the chemical reactions that occur within the organelles.
7.5.0.0.1.7	Ion concentrations differ from one organelle to another.
7.5.0.0.1.8	For instance, the pH (a reflection of the concentration on H+) is 7.4 inside the nucleus, but 4.5 (a concentration 1,000 times higher) inside another organelle, the lysosome.
7.5.0.0.1.1	Cell organelles and structures were first detected by light and then by electron microscopy.
7.5.0.0.1.2	The functions of the organelles could sometimes be inferred by observations and experiments, leading, for example, to the hypothesis (later confirmed) that the nucleus contained the genetic material.
7.5.0.0.1.3	Later, the use of stains targeted to specific macromolecules allowed cell biologists to determine the chemical compositions of organelles.
7.5.0.0.2.1	Another way to analyze cells is to take them apart in a process called differential centrifugation, or cell fractionation.
7.5.0.0.2.2	This process permits cell organelles and other cytoplasmic structures to be separated from each other and examined using chemical methods.
7.5.0.0.2.3	Cell fractionation begins with the destruction of the cell membrane, which allows the cytoplasmic components to flow out into a test tube.
7.5.0.0.2.4	The various organelles can then be separated from one another on the basis of size or density (Figure 5.6).
7.5.0.0.2.5	Biochemical analyses can then be done on the isolated organelles.
7.5.0.0.2.6	Microscopy and cell fractionation have complemented each other, giving us a more complete picture of the composition and function of each organelle and structure.
7.5.0.0.3.1	research tools
7.5.0.0.4.1	Figure 5.6 Cell Fractionation
7.5.0.0.5.1	Organelles can be separated from one another after cells are broken open and their contents suspended in an aqueous medium.
7.5.0.0.5.2	The medium is placed in a tube and spun in a centrifuge, which rotates about an axis at high speed.
7.5.0.0.5.3	Centrifugal forces (measured in multiples of gravity, &#x00D7; g) cause particles to sediment (form a pellet) at the bottom of the tube, which may be collected for biochemical study.
7.5.0.0.5.4	Heavier particles sediment at lower speeds (lower centrifugal forces) than lighter particles.
7.5.0.0.5.5	By adjusting the speed of centrifugation, researchers can separate and partially purify cellular organelles and large particles such as ribosomes.
7.5.0.0.6.1	Microscopy of eukaryotic cells has revealed that many of the organelles are similar in appearance in each cell type (Figure 5.7).
7.5.0.0.6.2	By comparing Figures 5.7 and 5.4 you can see some of the prominent differences between eukaryotic cells and prokaryotic cells.
7.5.0.0.6.3	Figure 5.7 Eukaryotic Cells
7.5.0.0.7.1	In electron micrographs, many plant cell organelles are nearly identical in form to those observed in animal cells.
7.5.0.0.7.2	Cellular structures found in plant but not animal cells include the cell wall and the chloroplasts.
7.5.0.0.7.3	Note that the images are two-dimensional    slices,  ? whereas cells are three-dimensional structures.
7.5.0.0.1.1	The *ribosomes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes are similar in that both types consist of two different-sized subunits.
7.5.0.0.1.2	Eukaryotic ribosomes are somewhat larger than those of prokaryotes, but the structure of prokaryotic ribosomes is better understood.
7.5.0.0.1.3	Chemically, ribosomes consist of a special type of RNA called ribosomal RNA (rRNA).
7.5.0.0.1.4	Ribosomes also contain more than 50 different protein molecules, which fit together noncovalently, employing forces for protein interaction such as hydrophobic interactions (see Figure 3.12).
7.5.0.0.1.5	Additionally, some of the proteins bind noncovalently to the rRNA.
7.5.0.0.2.1	*connect the concepts As discussed in Key Concept 14.5, the ribosome is the molecular workbench where mRNA is translated into protein.
7.5.0.0.3.1	In prokaryotic cells, ribosomes generally float freely in the cytoplasm.
7.5.0.0.3.2	In eukaryotic cells they are found in multiple places: floating freely in the cytoplasm or attached to the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (a membrane-bound organelle; see below), inside the mitochondria, and inside the chloroplasts in plant cells.
7.5.0.0.3.3	In each of these locations, the ribosomes are molecular factories where proteins are synthesized.
7.5.0.0.3.4	Although they seem small in comparison with the cells that contain them, by molecular standards ribosomes are huge complexes (about 25 nm in diameter), made up of several dozen different molecules.
7.5.0.0.4.1	Because they lack membranes and are not a compartment, ribosomes are not classified as organelles.
7.5.0.0.4.2	Rather, like the cytoskeleton (see below) they are called cell structures.
7.5.0.0.1.1	As we discussed in Chapter 4, hereditary information is stored in the sequence of nucleotides in DNA molecules.
7.5.0.0.1.2	Most of the DNA in eukaryotic cells resides in the nucleus (see Figure 5.7).
7.5.0.0.1.3	Information encoded in the DNA is translated into proteins at the ribosomes (a process we will describe in detail in Chapter 14).
7.5.0.0.2.1	Most cells have a single nucleus, which is usually the most prominent organelle.
7.5.0.0.2.2	The nucleus of a typical animal cell is approximately 5   m in diameter   substantially larger than many entire prokaryotic cells (Figure 5.8A).
7.5.0.0.2.3	The nucleus has several functions in the cell:
7.5.0.0.3.1	Figure 5.8 The Nucleus, Chromatin, and Chromosomes
7.5.0.0.4.1	(A) Chromatin consists of nuclear DNA and the proteins associated with it.
7.5.0.0.4.2	When the cell is not dividing, the chromatin is dispersed throughout the nucleus.
7.5.0.0.4.3	This two-dimensional image was made using a transmission electron microscope.
7.5.0.0.4.4	(B) The nuclear envelope has many pores that regulate traffic of large molecules such as RNA and proteins in and out of the nucleus.
7.5.0.0.4.5	(C) The chromatin in dividing cells becomes highly condensed, so that the individual chromosomes can be seen.
7.5.0.0.4.6	This three-dimensional image of isolated metaphase chromosomes was produced using a scanning electron microscope.
7.5.0.0.5.1	It is the location of most of the cell   s DNA and the site of DNA replication.
7.5.0.0.6.1	It is the site where gene transcription is turned on or off.
7.5.0.0.7.1	A region within the nucleus, the nucleolus, is where ribosomes begin to be assembled from RNA and proteins.
7.5.0.0.8.1	The contents of the nucleus, aside from the nucleolus, are referred to as the nucleoplasm.
7.5.0.0.8.2	Similar to the cytoplasm, the nucleoplasm consists of the liquid content of the nucleus and the insoluble molecules suspended within it.
7.5.0.0.9.1	The nucleus is surrounded by an integrated structure composed of two membranes, called the nuclear envelope.
7.5.0.0.9.2	This structure separates the genetic material from the cytoplasm.
7.5.0.0.9.3	Functionally, it separates DNA transcription (which occurs in the nucleus) from translation (which occurs in the cytoplasm) (see Key Concept 4.1).
7.5.0.0.9.4	The two membranes of the nuclear envelope are perforated by thousands of nuclear pores (Figure 5.8B), each measuring approximately 9 nm in diameter, which connect the nucleoplasm with the cytoplasm.
7.5.0.0.10.1	The pores act as    traffic cops,  ? allowing some molecules to pass into and out of the nucleus and blocking others.
7.5.0.0.10.2	This allows the nucleus to regulate its information-processing functions.
7.5.0.0.10.3	Small substances, including ions and other molecules with molecular weights of less than 10,000 daltons, move through the pores.
7.5.0.0.10.4	But larger molecules, such as most proteins that are made in the cytoplasm, can   t get through.
7.5.0.0.10.5	In some cases, however, there is a special transport mechanism to get such proteins into the nucleus; you   ll learn about this in Chapter 14.
7.5.0.0.11.1	Inside the nucleus, DNA is combined with proteins to form a fibrous complex called chromatin.
7.5.0.0.11.2	Chromatin occurs in the form of exceedingly long, thin threads called chromosomes.
7.5.0.0.11.3	Different eukaryotic organisms have different numbers of chromosomes (ranging from two in one kind of Australian ant to hundreds in some plants).
7.5.0.0.11.4	Prior to cell division, the chromatin becomes tightly compacted and condensed so that the individual chromosomes are visible under a light microscope.
7.5.0.0.11.5	This facilitates distribution of the DNA during cell division (Figure 5.8C).
7.5.0.0.12.1	At the inside edge of the nucleus, the chromatin is attached to a protein meshwork, called the nuclear lamina, which is formed by the polymerization of proteins called lamins into long, thin structures called intermediate filaments (see below).
7.5.0.0.12.2	The nuclear lamina maintains the shape of the nucleus by its attachment to both the chromatin and the nuclear envelope.
7.5.0.0.12.3	On the outside of the nucleus, the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope folds outward into the cytoplasm and is continuous with the membrane of another organelle, the endoplasmic reticulum, which we will discuss next.
7.5.0.0.1.1	Much of the volume of some eukaryotic cells is taken up by an extensive endomembrane system.
7.5.0.0.1.2	This is an interconnected system of membrane-enclosed compartments that are sometimes flattened into sheets and sometimes have other characteristic shapes (see Figure 5.7).
7.5.0.0.1.3	The endomembrane system includes the cell membrane, the nuclear envelope, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes, which are derived from the Golgi apparatus.
7.5.0.0.1.4	Tiny, membrane-surrounded droplets called vesicles shuttle substances between the various components of the endomembrane system (Focus: Key Figure 5.9).
7.5.0.0.1.5	In drawings and electron microscope pictures, this system appears static, fixed in space and time.
7.5.0.0.1.6	But these depictions are just snapshots; in the living cell, the membranes and the materials they contain are in constant motion.
7.5.0.0.1.7	Membrane components have been observed to shift from one organelle to another within the endomembrane system.
7.5.0.0.1.8	Thus all these membranes must be functionally related.
7.5.0.0.2.1	focus: key figure
7.5.0.0.3.1	Figure 5.9 The Endomembrane System
7.5.0.0.4.1	Membranes of the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus form a network connected by vesicles.
7.5.0.0.5.1	Q: What processes in the endomembrane system are mediated by vesicles?
7.5.0.0.1.1	Electron micrographs of eukaryotic cells reveal networks of interconnected membranes branching throughout the cytoplasm, forming tubes and flattened sacs.
7.5.0.0.1.2	These membranes are collectively called the endoplasmic reticulum, or ER.
7.5.0.0.1.3	The interior compartment of the ER, referred to as the lumen, is separate and distinct from the surrounding cytoplasm (see Figure 5.9).
7.5.0.0.1.4	The ER can enclose up to 10 percent of the interior volume of the cell, and its folds result in a surface area many times greater than that of the cell membrane.
7.5.0.0.1.5	There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum, the so-called rough and smooth.
7.5.0.0.1.1	is called    rough  ? because of the many ribosomes attached to the outer surface of the membrane, giving it a    rough  ? appearance in electron microscopy (see Figure 5.7).
7.5.0.0.1.2	The bound ribosomes are actively involved in protein synthesis, but that is not the entire story:
7.5.0.0.2.1	The RER receives into its lumen certain newly synthesized proteins (including proteins destined for lysosomes, the cell membrane, and export from the cell), segregating them away from the cytoplasm.
7.5.0.0.2.2	The RER also participates in transporting these proteins to other locations in the cell.
7.5.0.0.3.1	While inside the RER, proteins can be chemically modified to alter their functions and to    tag  ? them for delivery to specific cellular destinations.
7.5.0.0.4.1	Proteins are shipped to destinations elsewhere in the cell enclosed within vesicles that pinch off from the RER.
7.5.0.0.5.1	Most membrane-bound proteins are made in the RER.
7.5.0.0.6.1	A protein enters the lumen of the RER through a pore as it is synthesized.
7.5.0.0.6.2	As with a protein passing through a nuclear pore, there is a special transport mechanism to get proteins into the ER, which you   ll learn about in Chapter 14.
7.5.0.0.6.3	Once in the lumen of the RER, proteins undergo several changes, including the formation of disulfide bridges and folding into their tertiary structures (see Figure 3.5).
7.5.0.0.7.1	Some proteins are covalently linked to carbohydrate groups in the RER, thus becoming glycoproteins.
7.5.0.0.7.2	In the case of proteins directed to the lysosomes, the carbohydrate groups are part of an    addressing  ? system that ensures that the right proteins are directed to those organelles.
7.5.0.0.7.3	This addressing system is very important because the enzymes within the lysosomes are some of the most destructive the cell makes.
7.5.0.0.7.4	Were they not properly addressed and contained, they could destroy the cell.
7.5.0.0.1.1	lacks ribosomes and is more tubular (and less like flattened sacs) than the RER, but it shows continuity with portions of the RER (see Figure 5.9).
7.5.0.0.1.2	Certain proteins that are synthesized in the RER are chemically modified within the lumen of the *SER.
7.5.0.0.1.3	The SER has four other important roles:
7.5.0.0.2.1	It is responsible for the chemical modification of small molecules taken in by the cell that may be toxic to the cell.
7.5.0.0.2.2	These modifications make the targeted molecules more polar, so they are more water-soluble and easily removed.
7.5.0.0.3.1	It is the site for glycogen degradation in animal cells.
7.5.0.0.3.2	We will discuss this important process in Chapter 9.
7.5.0.0.4.1	It is the site where lipids and steroids are synthesized, as well as some polysaccharides in plant cells.
7.5.0.0.5.1	It stores calcium ions, which when released trigger a number of cell responses.
7.5.0.0.6.1	*connect the concepts Regulating muscle contraction is one of the important roles played by the calcium ions stored by the SER.
7.5.0.0.6.2	See Key Concept 48.1.
7.5.0.0.7.1	Cells that synthesize a lot of protein for export are usually packed with RER.
7.5.0.0.7.2	Examples include glandular cells that secrete digestive enzymes and white blood cells that secrete antibodies.
7.5.0.0.7.3	In contrast, cells that carry out less protein synthesis (such as storage cells) contain less RER.
7.5.0.0.7.4	Liver cells, which modify molecules (including toxins) that enter the body from the digestive system, have abundant SER.
7.5.0.0.1.1	The Golgi apparatus (or Golgi complex, or just Golgi) is another part of the diverse, dynamic, and extensive endomembrane system (see Figure 5.9).
7.5.0.0.1.2	This structure was named after its discoverer, Camillo Golgi.
7.5.0.0.1.3	Its appearance varies, but it almost always consists of two components: flattened membranous sacs called cisternae (singular cisterna) that are piled up like saucers, and small membrane-enclosed vesicles.
7.5.0.0.1.4	The entire apparatus is about 1   m long.
7.5.0.0.2.1	The Golgi apparatus has several roles:
7.5.0.0.3.1	It receives protein-containing vesicles from the RER.
7.5.0.0.4.1	It modifies, concentrates, packages, and sorts proteins before they are sent to their cellular or extracellular destinations.
7.5.0.0.5.1	It adds carbohydrates to proteins and modifies other carbohydrates that were attached to proteins in the RER.
7.5.0.0.6.1	It is where some polysaccharides for the plant cell wall are synthesized.
7.5.0.0.7.1	The cisternae of the Golgi apparatus have three functionally distinct regions:
7.5.0.0.8.1	The cis region lies nearest to the nucleus or a patch of RER.
7.5.0.0.9.1	The trans region lies closest to the cell membrane.
7.5.0.0.10.1	The medial region lies in between (see Figure 5.9).
7.5.0.0.11.1	The terms cis, trans, and medial derive from Latin words meaning, respectively,    on the same side,  ?    on the opposite side,  ? and    in the middle.  ?
7.5.0.0.11.2	These three parts of the Golgi apparatus contain different enzymes and perform different functions.
7.5.0.0.12.1	Protein-containing vesicles from the RER fuse with the cis membrane of the Golgi apparatus, releasing their cargo into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus cisterna.
7.5.0.0.12.2	Other vesicles may move between the cisternae, transporting proteins, and it appears that some proteins move from one cisterna to the next through tiny channels.
7.5.0.0.12.3	Vesicles budding off from the trans region carry their contents away from the Golgi apparatus.
7.5.0.0.12.4	These vesicles go to the cell membrane or to the lysosome, another organelle in the endomembrane system.
7.5.0.0.13.1	How do the vesicles in this system recognize their targets for fusion?
7.5.0.0.13.2	In other words, when a vesicle buds off from the ER, how does it    know  ? to fuse with the cis-Golgi membrane?
7.5.0.0.13.3	The answer lies in proteins on both membranes appropriately called SNARES.
7.5.0.0.13.4	Pairs of SNARES are complementary   that is, they bind to one another like a lock and key.
7.5.0.0.13.5	So the SNARE on the ER surface that forms a vesicle can bind to a SNARE on the cis-Golgi.
7.5.0.0.1.1	The primary lysosomes originate from the Golgi apparatus.
7.5.0.0.1.2	They contain digestive enzymes and are the sites where macromolecules   proteins, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and lipids   are hydrolyzed into their monomers (see Figure 3.4).
7.5.0.0.1.3	R1   R2 (linked monomers) + H2O     R1   OH + R2   H
7.5.0.0.2.1	Lysosomes are about 1&#x03BC;m in diameter, are surrounded by a single membrane, and have a densely staining, featureless interior (Figure 5.10).
7.5.0.0.2.2	There may be dozens of lysosomes in a cell, depending on its needs.
7.5.0.0.3.1	Figure 5.10 Lysosomes Isolate Digestive Enzymes from the Cytoplasm
7.5.0.0.4.1	Lysosomes are cellular    disposals,  ? compartments for the breakdown of food, other cells, or foreign objects that are taken up by the cell.
7.5.0.0.4.2	These materials enter the cell by a process called phagocytosis (phago,    eat,  ? + cytosis,    cellular  ?).
7.5.0.0.4.3	In this process, a pocket forms in the cell membrane and then deepens and encloses material from outside the cell.
7.5.0.0.4.4	The pocket becomes a small vesicle called a phagosome, containing food or other material, which breaks free of the cell membrane to move into the cytoplasm.
7.5.0.0.4.5	The phagosome fuses with a primary lysosome to form a secondary lysosome, where digestion occurs.
7.5.0.0.5.1	The effect of this fusion is rather like children devouring Halloween candy: the enzymes in the secondary lysosome quickly hydrolyze the food particles.
7.5.0.0.5.2	These reactions are enhanced by the acidity of the lysosome   s interior, where the pH is lower than in the surrounding cytoplasm.
7.5.0.0.5.3	The products of digestion pass through the membrane of the lysosome, providing energy and raw materials for other cellular processes.
7.5.0.0.5.4	For example, a protease might hydrolyze proteins to amino acids, which are released to the cytoplasm for reassembly into other proteins.
7.5.0.0.5.5	The    used  ? secondary lysosome, now containing undigested particles, then moves to the cell membrane, fuses with it, and releases the undigested contents to the environment, a process called exocytosis.
7.5.0.0.6.1	Phagocytes (see Key Concept 41.2) are specialized cells that have an essential role in taking up and breaking down materials; they are found in nearly all animals and many protists.
7.5.0.0.6.2	You will encounter them and their activities again at many places in this book, but at this point one example suffices: in the human liver and spleen, phagocytes digest approximately 10 billion aged or damaged blood cells each day!
7.5.0.0.6.3	The digestion products are then used to make new cells to replace those that are digested.
7.5.0.0.7.1	Lysosomes are active even in cells that do not perform phagocytosis.
7.5.0.0.7.2	Cells are dynamic systems; some cell components are continually being broken down and replaced by new ones.
7.5.0.0.7.3	The programmed destruction of cell components is called autophagy, and lysosomes are where the cell breaks down its own materials.
7.5.0.0.7.4	With the proper signal, lysosomes can engulf entire organelles, hydrolyzing their constituents.
7.5.0.0.8.1	How important is autophagy?
7.5.0.0.8.2	An entire class of human diseases called lysosomal storage diseases are caused by the failure of lysosomes to digest specific cellular components; these diseases are invariably harmful or fatal.
7.5.0.0.8.3	An example is Tay-Sachs disease, in which a particular lipid called a ganglioside is not broken down in the lysosomes and instead accumulates in brain cells.
7.5.0.0.8.4	In the most common form of this disease, a baby starts exhibiting neurological symptoms and becomes blind, deaf, and unable to swallow after 6 months of age.
7.5.0.0.8.5	Death occurs before age 4.
7.5.0.0.9.1	Plant cells do not appear to contain lysosomes, but the vacuole of a plant cell (which we will describe below) may function in an equivalent capacity because it, like lysosomes, contains many digestive enzymes.
7.5.0.0.1.1	A cell requires energy to make the molecules it needs for activities such as growth, reproduction, responsiveness, and movement.
7.5.0.0.1.2	Energy is harvested from fuel molecules in the mitochondria (found in all eukaryotic cells) and from sunlight in the chloroplasts of plant cells.
7.5.0.0.1.3	In contrast, energy transformations in prokaryotic cells are associated with enzymes attached to the inner surface of the cell membrane or to extensions of the cell membrane that protrude into the cytoplasm.
7.5.0.5.13a.1.1	In eukaryotic cells, the breakdown of energy-rich molecules such as glucose begins in the cytoplasm.
7.5.0.5.13a.1.2	The molecules that result from this partial degradation enter the mitochondria (singular mitochondrion), whose primary function is to harvest the chemical energy of those molecules in a form that the cell can use, namely the energy-rich molecule ATP (adenosine triphosphate) (see Key Concept 8.2).
7.5.0.5.13a.1.3	The production of ATP in the mitochondria, using fuel molecules and molecular oxygen (O2), is called cellular respiration.
7.5.0.5.13a.2.1	Typical mitochondria are somewhat less than 1.5   m in diameter and are 2   8   m in length   about the size of many bacteria.
7.5.0.5.13a.2.2	They can reproduce and divide independently of the central nucleus.
7.5.0.5.13a.2.3	The number of mitochondria per cell ranges from one large organelle in some unicellular protists to a few hundred thousand in large egg cells.
7.5.0.5.13a.2.4	An average human liver cell contains more than 1,000 mitochondria.
7.5.0.5.13a.2.5	Cells that are active in movement and growth require the most chemical energy, and these tend to have the most mitochondria per unit of volume.
7.5.0.5.13a.2.6	Figure 5.11 A Mitochondrion Converts Energy from Fuel Molecules into ATP
7.5.0.5.13a.3.1	Q: What kinds of human cells would you expect to have a lot of mitochondria?
7.5.0.5.13a.4.1	Mitochondria have two membranes.
7.5.0.5.13a.4.2	The outer membrane is smooth and protective, and it offers little resistance to the movement of substances into and out of the organelle.
7.5.0.5.13a.4.3	Immediately inside the outer membrane is an inner membrane, which folds inward in many places and thus has a surface area much greater than that of the outer membrane (Figure 5.11).
7.5.0.5.13a.4.4	The folds tend to be quite regular, giving rise to shelflike structures called cristae.
7.5.0.5.13a.4.5	The inner membrane exerts much more control over what enters and leaves the space it encloses than does the outer membrane.
7.5.0.5.13a.4.6	Embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane are many large protein complexes that participate in cellular respiration.
7.5.0.5.13a.5.1	The space enclosed by the inner membrane is referred to as the mitochondrial matrix.
7.5.0.5.13a.5.2	In addition to many enzymes, the matrix contains ribosomes and DNA that are used to make some of the proteins needed for cellular respiration.
7.5.0.5.13a.5.3	As we will discuss later in this chapter, it is likely that this DNA is the remnant of a larger, complete chromosome from a prokaryote that may have been the mitochondrion   s progenitor.
7.5.0.5.13a.5.4	In Chapter 9 we will discuss how the different parts of the mitochondrion work together in cellular respiration.
7.5.0.0.1.1	One class of organelles   the plastids   is present only in the cells of plants and certain protists.
7.5.0.0.1.2	Like mitochondria, plastids can divide independently of the cell nucleus and probably evolved from independent prokaryotes.
7.5.0.0.1.3	There are several types of plastids, with different functions.
7.5.0.0.2.1	Just as melanosomes are a compartment for pigment in animal cells (see the chapter opening), so are chloroplasts, which contain the green pigment chlorophyll and are the sites of photosynthesis (Figure 5.12).
7.5.0.0.2.2	In photosynthesis, light energy is converted into the chemical energy of bonds between atoms.
7.5.0.0.2.3	The molecules formed by photosynthesis provide food for the photosynthetic organism and for other organisms that eat it.
7.5.0.0.2.4	Directly or indirectly, photosynthesis is the energy source for most of the living world.
7.5.0.0.2.5	Figure 5.12 Chloroplasts Feed the World
7.5.0.0.3.1	The electron micrographs show chloroplasts from a leaf of corn.
7.5.0.0.3.2	Chloroplasts are large compared with mitochondria and contain extensive networks of thylakoid membranes.
7.5.0.0.3.3	These membranes contain the green pigment chlorophyll, and are the sites where light energy is converted into chemical energy for the synthesis of carbohydrates from CO2 and H2O.
7.5.0.0.4.1	Like a mitochondrion, a chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes.
7.5.0.0.4.2	In addition, there is a series of internal membranes whose structure and arrangement vary from one group of photosynthetic organisms to another.
7.5.0.0.4.3	Here we concentrate on the chloroplasts of the flowering plants.
7.5.0.0.5.1	The internal membranes of chloroplasts look like stacks of flat, hollow pita bread.
7.5.0.0.5.2	Each stack is called a granum (plural grana) and the pita bread   like compartments are called thylakoids (see Figure 5.12).
7.5.0.0.5.3	Thylakoid lipids are distinctive: only 10 percent are phospholipids, whereas the rest are galactose-substituted diglycerides and sulfolipids.
7.5.0.0.5.4	Because of the abundance of chloroplasts, these are the most abundant lipids in the biosphere.
7.5.0.0.6.1	In addition to lipids and proteins, the membranes of the thylakoids contain chlorophyll and other pigments that harvest light energy for photosynthesis (we will see how they do this in Key Concept 10.2).
7.5.0.0.6.2	The thylakoids of one granum may be connected to those of other grana, making the interior of the chloroplast a highly developed network of membranes, much like the ER.
7.5.0.0.7.1	The fluid in which the grana are suspended is called the stroma.
7.5.0.0.7.2	Like the mitochondrial matrix, the chloroplast stroma contains ribosomes and DNA, which are used to synthesize some, but not all, of the proteins that make up the chloroplast.
7.5.0.0.8.1	Other types of plastids, such as chromoplasts and leucoplasts, have functions different from those of chloroplasts.
7.5.0.0.8.2	Chromoplasts make and store red, yellow, and orange pigments, especially in flowers and fruits   again, just as the melanocytes in the opening story store pigment.
7.5.0.0.9.1	Leucoplasts are storage organelles that do not contain pigments.
7.5.0.0.9.2	An amyloplast is a leucoplast that stores starch.
7.5.0.0.1.1	There are several other organelles whose boundary membranes separate their specialized chemical reactions and contents from the rest of the cytoplasm: peroxisomes, glyoxysomes, and vacuoles.
7.5.0.0.1.1	are organelles that accumulate toxic peroxides, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), that occur as by-products of some biochemical reactions.
7.5.0.0.1.2	These peroxides are safely broken down inside the peroxisomes without mixing with other parts of the cell.
7.5.0.0.1.3	RH2 + O2     R + H2O2 (cellular reactions) 2 H2O2     2 H2O + O2 (inside peroxisome)
7.5.0.0.2.1	Peroxisomes are small organelles, about 0.2   1.7   m in diameter.
7.5.0.0.2.2	They have a single membrane and a granular interior containing specialized enzymes.
7.5.0.0.2.3	Peroxisomes are found in at least some of the cells of almost every eukaryotic species.
7.5.0.0.3.1	As with lysosomes, there are rare inherited diseases in humans that involve peroxisomes.
7.5.0.0.3.2	In Zellweger syndrome there is a defect in peroxisome assembly, and affected infants are born without peroxisomes.
7.5.0.0.3.3	As you can imagine, a consequence of this is the accumulation of toxic peroxides, and the infants seldom live beyond 1 year of age.
7.5.0.0.4.1	Glyoxysomes are similar to peroxisomes and are found only in plants.
7.5.0.0.4.2	They are most abundant in young plants and are the locations where stored lipids are converted into carbohydrates for transport to growing cells.
7.5.0.0.5.1	Vacuoles occur in many eukaryotic cells but particularly those of plants, fungi, and protists.
7.5.0.0.5.2	They arise from the ER or Golgi apparatus.
7.5.0.0.5.3	Plant vacuoles (Figure 5.13) have several functions: Figure 5.13 Vacuoles in Plant Cells Are Usually Large
7.5.0.0.6.1	Structure: In many plant cells, vacuoles take up more than 90 percent of the cell volume and grow as the cell grows.
7.5.0.0.6.2	The presence of dissolved substances in the vacuole causes water to enter it from the cytoplasm, making the vacuole swell like a balloon.
7.5.0.0.6.3	A mature plant cell does not swell when the vacuole fills with water, since it has a rigid cell wall.
7.5.0.0.6.4	Instead, it stiffens from the increase in water pressure (called turgor), and this supports the plant body (see Figure 6.10).
7.5.0.0.7.1	Reproduction: Vacuoles contain some of the pigments (especially blue and pink ones) in the petals and fruits of flowering plants.
7.5.0.0.7.2	These pigments   the anthocyanins   are visual cues that help attract animals that assist in pollination or seed dispersal.
7.5.0.0.8.1	Digestion: In some plants, the vacuoles in seeds contain enzymes that hydrolyze stored proteins into monomers.
7.5.0.0.8.2	During seed germination, the monomers are used as food by the developing plant seedlings.
7.5.0.0.9.1	Storage: In addition to storing water, vacuoles store toxic molecules and waste products.
7.5.0.0.9.2	Because they are poisonous or distasteful, these stored materials deter some animals from eating the plants and may thus contribute to plant defense and survival.
7.5.0.0.9.3	An example is tannins, a class of polyphenols that are made in many plants and may be familiar to you as the aftertaste in tea and red wine.
7.5.0.0.9.4	Their bitter taste deters predators, and their dark color acts like animal melanin to protect the plant from ultraviolet light damage.
7.5.0.0.9.5	Tannins are made in the chloroplast and end up in the vacuole.
7.5.0.0.9.6	A newly discovered organelle, appropriately named the tannosome, contains tannins (Investigating Life: Discovering a New Organelle, the Tannosome).
7.5.0.0.10.1	So far we have discussed numerous membrane-enclosed organelles.
7.5.0.0.10.2	Now we will turn to a group of cytoplasmic structures without membranes.
7.5.0.0.1.1	Cell shapes can sometimes change, and there appear to be rapid movements of structures inside cells.
7.5.0.0.1.2	These phenomena involve a meshwork of rods within cells that can be seen in electron microscopy.
7.5.0.0.1.3	Experimentation showed that this meshwork   called the cytoskeleton   fills several important roles:
7.5.0.0.2.1	It supports the cell and maintains its shape.
7.5.0.0.3.1	It holds cell organelles and other particles in position within the cell.
7.5.0.0.4.1	It moves organelles and other particles around in the cell.
7.5.0.0.5.1	It is involved with movements of the cytoplasm, called cytoplasmic streaming.
7.5.0.0.6.1	It interacts with extracellular structures, helping anchor the cell in place.
7.5.0.0.7.1	There are three components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton: microfilaments (smallest diameter), intermediate filaments, and microtubules (largest diameter).
7.5.0.0.7.2	These filaments have very different functions.

7.5.0.0.11.1	Original Paper: Brillouet, J.-M. et al. 2013.
7.5.0.0.11.2	The tannosome is an organelle forming condensed tannins in the chlorophyllous organs of Tracheophyta.
7.5.0.0.11.3	Annals of Botany 112: 1003&#x2014;1014.
7.5.0.0.12.1	Through a series of investigations involving microscopy, cell fractionation, and chemical analysis, biologists discovered that plant tannins are compartmentalized in a heretofore undiscovered structure, the tannosome.
7.5.0.0.13.1	QUESTION Are pigments compartmentalized in all types of cells?
7.5.0.0.14.1	CONCULATION Tannins are present in an organelle that begins in the chloroplast
7.5.0.0.15.1	work with the data
7.5.0.0.16.1	The team of biologists and chemists (Brillouet et al. , 2013) at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research, led by Genevi&#232;ve Conejero, sought to investigate the cellular basis of tannin formation.
7.5.0.0.16.2	It was well known from electron micrographs that these pigments accumulate in vacuoles, but how they got there was not established.
7.5.0.0.16.3	The team used a combination of microscopy (light and electron) (see Figure 5.3), cell fractionation (see Figure 5.6), and chemical analysis to show that tannins are formed in discrete vesicles, which the researchers named tannosomes.
7.5.0.0.17.1	QUESTIONS
7.5.0.0.18.1	Plant organs rich in tannins were examined by electron microscopy.
7.5.0.0.18.2	Representative photographs are shown in Figure A. What do these images indicate about the origin and final resting spot of tannins in the cell?
7.5.0.0.18.3	Based on what you know of vesicle trafficking in the cell, how do you think the tannins get from the chloroplast to the vacuole?
7.5.0.0.19.1	Figure A
7.5.0.0.20.1	The scientists used specific dyes targeted to chlorophyll and tannins and examined slices of plant tissues by light microscopy.
7.5.0.0.20.2	Figure B shows the results.

7.5.0.0.22.1	Cell fractionation was used to try to isolate tannin-containing structures separate from chloroplasts.
7.5.0.0.22.2	In a very dense (72%), syrupy sucrose medium, fractionated cell contents showed two membrane-bound fractions (see the experiment).
7.5.0.0.22.3	Both were examined by microscopy for tannin staining, and the contents were analyzed for chlorophyll and tannins.
7.5.0.0.22.4	The results are shown in the table.
7.5.0.0.22.5	What can you conclude about the tannin compartment? &#160; Upper fraction Lower fraction Staining for tannins No Yes Staining for chlorophyll Yes Yes Chemical analysis for tannins No Yes A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.5.0.0.1.1	Microfilaments can exist as single filaments, in bundles, or in networks.
7.5.0.0.1.2	They are about 7 nm in diameter and up to several micrometers long.
7.5.0.0.1.3	Microfilaments have two major roles:
7.5.0.0.2.1	They help the entire cell or parts of the cell move.
7.5.0.0.3.1	They determine and stabilize cell shape.
7.5.0.0.4.1	Microfilaments are assembled from monomers of actin, a protein that exists in several forms and has many functions, especially in animals.
7.5.0.0.4.2	The actin found in microfilaments (which are also known as *actin filaments) has distinct ends, designated    plus  ? and    minus.  ?
7.5.0.0.4.3	These ends permit actin monomers to interact with one another to form long, double helical chains (Figure 5.14A).
7.5.0.0.4.4	Within cells, the polymerization of actin into microfilaments is reversible, and the microfilaments can disappear from cells by breaking down into monomers of free actin.
7.5.0.0.4.5	Special actin-binding proteins mediate these processes.
7.5.0.0.5.1	Figure 5.14 The Cytoskeleton
7.5.0.0.6.1	Three highly visible and important structural components of the cytoskeleton are shown here in detail.
7.5.0.0.6.2	The photographs are all of the same cell, treated with different fluorescent antibodies that detect microfilaments (A), intermediate filaments (B), or microtubules (C).
7.5.0.0.6.3	These structures maintain and reinforce cell shape and contribute to cell movement.
7.5.0.0.6.4	The position of the cell   s nucleus is near the center of the photos.
7.5.0.0.7.1	*connect the concepts In animal muscle cells, actin filaments are associated with another protein, the    motor protein  ? myosin, and the interactions of these two proteins account for the contraction of muscles, as described in Key Concept 48.2.
7.5.0.0.7.2	Figure 5.15 Microfilaments and Cell Movements
7.5.0.0.8.1	In non-muscle cells, actin filaments are associated with localized changes in cell shape.
7.5.0.0.8.2	For example, microfilaments are involved in the flowing movement of the cytoplasm called cytoplasmic streaming, in amoeboid movement, and in the    pinching  ? contractions that divide an animal cell into two daughter cells.
7.5.0.0.8.3	Microfilaments are also involved in the formation of cellular extensions called pseudopodia (pseudo,    false,  ? + podia,    feet  ?) that enable some cells to move (Figure 5.15).
7.5.0.0.8.4	As you will see in Chapter 41. x, cells of the immune system must move toward other cells during the immune response.
7.5.0.0.8.5	Figure 5.16 Microfilaments for Support
7.5.0.0.9.1	In some cell types, microfilaments form a meshwork just inside the cell membrane.
7.5.0.0.9.2	Actin-binding proteins then cross-link the microfilaments to form a rigid netlike structure that supports the cell.
7.5.0.0.9.3	For example, microfilaments support the tiny microvilli that line the human intestine, giving it a larger surface area through which to absorb nutrients (Figure 5.16).
7.5.0.0.1.1	There are at least 50 different kinds of intermediate filaments, many of them specific to a few cell types.
7.5.0.0.1.2	They generally fall into six molecular classes (based on amino acid sequence) that share the same general structure.
7.5.0.0.1.3	One of these classes consists of fibrous proteins of the keratin family, which also includes the proteins that make up hair and fingernails.
7.5.0.0.1.4	Intermediate filaments are tough, ropelike protein structures 8   12 nm in diameter (Figure 5.14B).
7.5.0.0.1.5	They are more permanent than the other two types in that they do not continually form and re-form, as the microtubules and microfilaments do.
7.5.0.0.2.1	Intermediate filaments have two major structural functions:
7.5.0.0.3.1	They anchor cell structures in place.
7.5.0.0.3.2	In some cells, intermediate filaments radiate from the nuclear envelope and help maintain the positions of the nucleus and other organelles in the cell.
7.5.0.0.3.3	The lamins of the nuclear lamina are intermediate filaments.
7.5.0.0.3.4	Other kinds of intermediate filaments help hold in place the complex apparatus of microfilaments in the microvilli of intestinal cells (see Figure 5.16).
7.5.0.0.4.1	They resist tension.
7.5.0.0.4.2	For example, they maintain rigidity in body surface tissues by stretching through the cytoplasm and connecting specialized membrane structures called desmosomes (see Figure 6.7).
7.5.0.0.1.1	The largest-diameter components of the cytoskeletal system, microtubules, are long, hollow, unbranched cylinders about 25 nm in diameter and up to several micrometers long.
7.5.0.0.1.2	Microtubules have two roles in the cell:
7.5.0.0.2.1	They form a rigid internal skeleton for some cells.
7.5.0.0.3.1	They act as a framework along which motor proteins can move structures within the cell.
7.5.0.0.4.1	Microtubules are assembled from dimers   two similar molecules in a complex   of the protein tubulin, called   -tubulin and   -tubulin.
7.5.0.0.4.2	Thirteen chains of tubulin doublets surround the central cavity of the microtubule (Figure 5.14C; see also Figure 5.17B). -tubulin +   -tubulin     doublet ~ polymer of doublets (microtubule)
7.5.0.0.5.1	Figure 5.17 Cilia
7.5.0.0.6.1	(A) This unicellular eukaryotic organism (a ciliate protist) can coordinate the beating of its cilia, allowing rapid movement.
7.5.0.0.6.2	(B) A cross section of a single cilium shows the arrangement of microtubules and other proteins.
7.5.0.0.7.1	As in microfilaments, the two ends of a microtubule are different: one is designated the    plus  ? end and the other the    minus  ? end.
7.5.0.0.7.2	Tubulin dimers can be rapidly added or subtracted, mainly at the plus end, lengthening or shortening the microtubule.
7.5.0.0.8.1	Many microtubules appear to radiate from a region of the cell called the microtubule organizing center.
7.5.0.0.8.2	Tubulin polymerization results in a rigid structure, and tubulin depolymerization leads to its collapse.
7.5.0.0.8.3	Microtubule     tubulin doublets
7.5.0.0.9.1	The capacity to change length rapidly makes microtubules dynamic structures: they are readily adapted for new purposes in the cell.
7.5.0.0.9.2	For example, by disassembly and reassembly, microtubules can move to new parts of the cell and assemble new structures needed for cell division.
7.5.0.0.9.3	Microtubules from all eukaryotes have this dynamic property, indicating that it is evolutionarily advantageous over a static, unchanging structure.
7.5.0.0.10.1	In plants, microtubules act as a framework for the assembly of cellulose and help orient the cellulose fibers of the cell wall (see Figure 3.18).
7.5.0.0.10.2	Electron micrographs of plants frequently show microtubules lying just inside the cell membranes of cells that are forming or extending their cell walls.
7.5.0.0.10.3	If the orientation of these microtubules is altered experimentally, it leads to a similar change in the cell wall and a new shape for the cell.
7.5.0.0.11.1	Microtubules serve as tracks for motor proteins, specialized molecules that use cellular energy to change their shapes and move.
7.5.0.0.11.2	Motor proteins bind to and move along the microtubules, carrying materials from one part of the cell to another.
7.5.0.0.11.3	Microtubules are also essential in distributing chromosomes to daughter cells during cell division.
7.5.0.0.11.4	Because of this, drugs such as vincristine and taxol, which disrupt microtubule dynamics, also disrupt cell division.
7.5.0.0.11.5	These drugs are useful for treating cancer, where cell division is excessive.
7.5.0.0.1.1	Microtubules and their associated proteins line the interior of certain movable appendages on eukaryotic cells: the cilia (Figure 5.17A) and flagella.
7.5.0.0.1.2	Many cells have one or the other of these appendages, which form from projections of the cell membrane:
7.5.0.0.2.1	Cilia are only 0.25   m in length.
7.5.0.0.2.2	They occur by the hundreds on individual cells and move stiffly to either propel the cell (for example, in protists) or to move fluid over a stationary cell (as in the human respiratory system).
7.5.0.0.3.1	Flagella are longer   100 to 200   m   and occur singly or in pairs.
7.5.0.0.3.2	They can push or pull a cell through its aqueous environment.
7.5.0.0.4.1	In cross section, a typical cilium or eukaryotic flagellum is surrounded by the cell membrane and contains a    9 + 2  ? array of microtubules.
7.5.0.0.4.2	As Figure 5.17B shows, nine fused pairs of microtubules form an outer cylinder, and one pair of unfused microtubules runs up the center.
7.5.0.0.4.3	Each doublet is connected to the center of the structure by a radial spoke.
7.5.0.0.4.4	This structure is essential to the bending motion of both cilia and flagella.
7.5.0.0.4.5	How does this bending occur?
7.5.0.0.5.1	The motion of cilia and flagella results from the sliding of the microtubule doublets past one another.
7.5.0.0.5.2	This sliding is driven by the motor protein dynein, which, like other motor proteins, works by undergoing reversible shape changes that require chemical energy.
7.5.0.0.5.3	Dynein molecules bind between two neighboring microtubule pairs, and as the dynein molecules change shape, the pairs move past one another (Figure 5.18).
7.5.0.0.5.4	Another protein, nexin, cross-links the pairs and appears to limit how far the doublets can slide.
7.5.0.0.5.5	This causes the cilium or flagellum to bend.
7.5.0.0.6.1	Figure 5.18 Motor Protein Moves Microtubules in Cilia and Flagella
7.5.0.0.7.1	A motor protein, dynein, causes microtubule doublets to slide past one another.
7.5.0.0.7.2	In a flagellum or cilium, anchorage of the microtubule doublets to one another results in bending.
7.5.0.0.8.1	Q: In some people, the nexin links are absent and microtubule doublets are not attached to one another.
7.5.0.0.8.2	What do you think the consequences of this would be?
7.5.0.0.9.1	Other motor proteins, including kinesin, carry protein-laden vesicles or other organelles from one part of the cell to another (Figure 5.19).
7.5.0.0.9.2	These proteins bind to the organelle and    walk  ? it along a microtubule by a repeated series of shape changes.
7.5.0.0.9.3	Recall that *microtubules are directional, with a plus end where there is a net addition of tubulin and a minus end where there is removal.
7.5.0.0.9.4	Cytoplasmic dynein (which has a different role than the one found in cilia and flagella) moves organelles attached to it toward the minus end, whereas kinesin moves them toward the plus end (see Figure 5.14).
7.5.0.0.9.5	The ability of microtubules to carry vesicles is used by some fish and amphibians to avoid predators.
7.5.0.0.9.6	Motor proteins carrying pigment vesicles aggregate them in the center of the cell in response to environmental or nervous system stimuli.
7.5.0.0.9.7	This makes the animal appear lighter.
7.5.0.0.9.8	When the stimuli are removed, other motor proteins move the vesicles along microtubules to a more even distribution, restoring a darker hue.
7.5.0.0.10.1	Figure 5.19 A Motor Protein Pulls Vesicles along Microtubules
7.5.0.0.11.1	(A) Kinesin delivers vesicles to various parts of the cell by moving along microtubule    railroad tracks.  ?
7.5.0.0.11.2	(B) A vesicle is pulled by kinesin along a microtubule in the protist Dictyostelium.
7.5.0.0.11.3	The time sequence, with half-second intervals, is shown by the color changes from purple to blue.
7.5.0.0.12.1	*connect the concepts Perhaps the most dramatic role of microtubules is in the process of chromosome movement during cell division.
7.5.0.0.12.2	See Key Concept 11.3.
7.5.0.5.0-5.1.1	How do we know that the structural fibers of the cytoskeleton can achieve all these dynamic functions?
7.5.0.5.0-5.1.2	We can observe an individual structure under the microscope, and we can observe the functions of living cells that contain that structure.
7.5.0.5.0-5.1.3	These observations may suggest that the structure carries out a particular function, but mere correlation does not show cause and effect.
7.5.0.5.0-5.1.4	For example, light microscopy of living cells reveals that the cytoplasm is actively streaming around the cell, and that cytoplasm flows into an extended portion of an amoeboid cell during movement.
7.5.0.5.0-5.1.5	The observed presence of cytoskeletal components suggests, but does not prove, their role in this process.
7.5.0.5.0-5.1.6	Science seeks to show the specific links that relate one process, A, to a function, B. In cell biology, two approaches are often used to show that a structure or process A causes function B:
7.5.0.5.0-5.2.1	Inhibition: Use a drug that inhibits A and see if B still occurs.
7.5.0.5.0-5.2.2	If it does not, then A is probably a causative factor for B. Figure 5.20 shows an experiment with such a drug (an inhibitor) that demonstrates cause and effect in the case of the cytoskeleton and cell movement.
7.5.0.5.0-5.3.1	Mutation: Examine a cell that lacks the gene (or genes) for A and see if B still occurs.
7.5.0.5.0-5.3.2	If it does not, then A is probably a causative factor for B. Part Four of this book will describe many experiments using this genetic approach.
7.5.0.5.0-5.4.1	Mutation: Examine a cell that lacks the gene (or genes) for A and see if B still occurs.
7.5.0.5.0-5.4.2	If it does not, then A is probably a causative factor for B. Part Four of this book will describe many experiments using this genetic approach.

7.5.0.5.0-5.14.1	Original Paper: Pollard, T. D. and R. R. Weihing. 1974.
7.5.0.5.0-5.15.1	In a search for natural molecules that have effects on cells&#x2014;particularly cancer cells&#x2014;a team of chemists and biologists at Imperial Chemical Industries examined extracts of the fungus Helminthosporium dematiodeium.
7.5.0.5.0-5.15.2	When the extracts appeared to inhibit cell division, the scientists purified the active ingredient and called it cytochalasin B (from the Greek cyto, &#x201C;cell&#x201D; and chalasis, &#x201C;dislocation&#x201D;).
7.5.0.5.0-5.15.3	Remarkably, application of cytochalasin B to dividing cells blocked the division of the cytoplasm but not division of the nucleus, so the result was a binucleate cell.
7.5.0.5.0-5.15.4	In addition, the drug inhibited cell movement and phagocytosis.

7.5.0.5.0-5.29.1	The drug vincristine is used to treat many cancers.
7.5.0.5.0-5.29.2	It appears to work by causing microtubules to depolymerize.

7.5.0.5.0-5.31.2	Many eukaryotic cells are parts of multicellular organisms and must closely coordinate their activities with other cells.

7.5.0.5.0-5.33.1	5.4 Extracellular Structures Have Important Roles
7.5.4.1.1	What is the plant cell wall?
7.5.4.2.1	The extracellular matrix supports tissue functions in animals
7.5.4.3.1	Although the cell membrane is the functional barrier between the inside and the outside of a cell, many structures are produced by cells and secreted to the outside of the cell membrane, where they play essential roles in protecting, supporting, or attaching cells to each other.
7.5.4.3.2	Because they are outside the cell membrane, these structures are said to be extracellular.
7.5.4.3.3	The peptidoglycan cell wall of bacteria is an example of an extracellular structure (see Figure 5.4).
7.5.4.3.4	In eukaryotes, other extracellular structures   the cell walls of plants and the extracellular matrices found between the cells of animals   play similar roles.
7.5.4.3.5	Each of these structures is made up of two main components: a prominent fibrous macromolecule and a gel-like medium in which the fibers are embedded.
7.5.4.4.1	focus your learning
7.5.4.5.1	Extracellular structures are important for protection, support, and interacting with other cells.
7.5.0.0.1.1	Figure 5.21 The Plant Cell Wall
7.5.0.0.2.1	The plant cell wall is a semirigid structure outside the cell membrane (Figure 5.21).
7.5.0.0.2.2	We will consider the structure and role of the cell wall in more detail in Chapter 33.
7.5.0.0.2.3	For now, we note that it consists of cellulose fibers (see Figure 3.18) embedded in other complex polysaccharides and proteins.
7.5.0.0.2.4	The plant cell wall has three major roles:
7.5.0.0.3.1	It provides support for the cell and plant by remaining rigid.
7.5.0.0.3.2	Yet it is flexible enough that it can allow the plant to bend in the wind, for example.
7.5.0.0.4.1	It acts as a barrier to infection by fungi and other organisms that can cause plant diseases.
7.5.0.0.5.1	It contributes to plant form by growing as the plant cells expand.
7.5.0.0.6.1	In some cells, such as those in a leaf, the cell wall is porous to allow the passage of molecules into and out of the cell.
7.5.0.0.6.2	In other cells, such as those of the plant   s vascular system (which transports water and small molecules between organs), the wall is not porous.
7.5.0.0.7.1	Because of their thick cell walls, plant cells viewed under a light microscope appear to be entirely isolated from one another.
7.5.0.0.7.2	But electron microscopy reveals that this is not the case.
7.5.0.0.7.3	The cytoplasms of adjacent plant cells are connected by numerous cell membrane   lined channels called plasmodesmata, which are about 20   40 nm in diameter and extend through the cell walls (see Figure 5.7).
7.5.0.0.7.4	Plasmodesmata permit the diffusion of water, ions, small molecules, RNA, and proteins between connected cells, allowing for the use of these substances far from their sites of synthesis.
7.5.0.0.7.5	Plasmodesmata also enable communication between adjacent cells.
7.5.0.0.1.1	Animal cells lack the semirigid wall that is characteristic of plant cells, but many animal cells are surrounded by, or in contact with, an extracellular matrix.
7.5.0.0.1.2	This matrix is composed of three types of molecules: fibrous proteins such as collagen (the most abundant protein in mammals, constituting over 25 percent of the protein in the human body); a matrix of glycoproteins termed proteoglycans, consisting primarily of sugars; and a third group of proteins that link the fibrous proteins and the gel-like proteoglycan matrix together (Figure 5.22).
7.5.0.0.1.3	These proteins and proteoglycans are secreted, along with other substances that are specific to certain body tissues, by cells that are present in or near the matrix.
7.5.0.0.2.1	Figure 5.22 An Extracellular Matrix
7.5.0.0.3.1	Cells in the kidney secrete a basal lamina, which is an extracellular matrix that separates the kidney cells from a nearby blood vessel.
7.5.0.0.3.2	The basal lamina filters materials that pass between the kidney and the blood.
7.5.0.0.4.1	The functions of the extracellular matrix are many:
7.5.0.0.5.1	It holds cells together in tissues.
7.5.0.0.5.2	In Chapter 6 we will see how there is an intercellular    glue  ? that is involved in both cell recognition and adhesion.
7.5.0.0.6.1	It contributes to the physical properties of cartilage, skin, and other tissues.
7.5.0.0.6.2	For example, the mineral component of bone is laid down on an organized extracellular matrix.
7.5.0.0.7.1	It helps filter materials passing between different tissues.
7.5.0.0.7.2	This is especially important in the kidney.
7.5.0.0.8.1	It helps orient cell movements during embryonic development and during tissue repair.
7.5.0.0.9.1	It plays a role in chemical signaling from one cell to another.
7.5.0.0.9.2	Proteins connect the cell   s cell membrane to the extracellular matrix.
7.5.0.0.9.3	These proteins (for example, integrin) span the cell membrane and are involved with transmitting signals to the interior of the cell.
7.5.0.0.9.4	This allows communication between the extracellular matrix and the cytoplasm of the cell.
7.5.0.0.10.1	5.4 recap
7.5.0.0.11.1	Extracellular structures are produced by cells and secreted outside the cell membrane.
7.5.0.0.11.2	Most consist of a fibrous component in a gel-like medium.

7.5.0.0.16.1	Analyze changes to cells involving extracellular components.
7.5.0.0.17.1	When a cancer spreads from the initial site to another location in the body, initial events are the detachment of the cancer cells from its surrounding extra cellular matrix and digestion of the matrix as the cell migrates.
7.5.0.0.17.2	How might these events occur?
7.5.0.0.18.1	How does the structure of a cell wall contribute to its function?
7.5.0.0.19.1	How could a biologist use chemical analysis to differentiate between a plant cell and an animal cell?
7.5.0.0.20.1	We have now discussed the structures and some functions of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.
7.5.0.0.20.2	Both exemplify the cell theory, showing that cells are the basic units of life and of biological continuity.
7.5.0.0.20.3	Much of the rest of this part of the book will deal with these two aspects of cells.
7.5.0.0.20.4	There is abundant evidence that the simpler prokaryotic cells are more ancient than eukaryotic cells, and that the first cells were probably prokaryotic.
7.5.0.0.20.5	We will now turn to the next step in cellular evolution, the origin of eukaryotic cells.
7.5.0.0.21.1	Chapter 5 continues with
7.5.0.0.22.1	5.5 Eukaryotic Cells Evolved in Several Steps
7.5.5.1.1	Internal membranes and the nuclear envelope probably came from the cell membrane
7.5.5.2.1	Some organelles arose by endosymbiosis
7.5.5.3.1	Life on Earth was entirely prokaryotic for about 2 billion years   from the time when prokaryotic cells first appeared until about 1.5 billion years ago, when evidence of eukaryotic cells appears in ancient rocks.
7.5.5.3.2	The advent of compartmentalization   the hallmark of eukaryotes   was a major event in the history of life.
7.5.5.3.3	It permitted many more biochemical functions to exist in the same cell than had previously been possible.
7.5.5.3.4	Compared with a typical eukaryote, a single prokaryotic cell is often biochemically specialized, limited in the resources it can use and the functions it can perform.
7.5.5.4.1	focus your learning
7.5.5.5.1	Biologists theorize that the endomembrane system and the cell nucleus originated as the result of infoldings of the cell membrane.
7.5.5.6.1	The theory of endosymbiosis proposes that organelles arose when cells engulfed other cells, and this arrangement led to symbiotic relationships.
7.5.5.7.1	What is the origin of compartmentalization?
7.5.5.7.2	We will describe the evolution of eukaryotic organelles in more detail in Key Concept 26.1.
7.5.5.7.3	Here we outline two major themes in this process.
7.5.0.0.1.1	We noted earlier in this chapter that some bacteria contain internal membranes.
7.5.0.0.1.2	How could these arise?
7.5.0.0.1.3	In electron micrographs, the internal membranes of prokaryotes often appear to be inward folds of the cell membrane.
7.5.0.0.1.4	This observation has led to a theory that the endomembrane system and the cell nucleus originated by related processes (Figure 5.23A).
7.5.0.0.1.5	The close relationship between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the nuclear envelope in today   s eukaryotes is consistent with this theory.
7.5.0.0.2.1	Figure 5.23 The Origins of Organelles
7.5.0.0.3.1	(A) The endomembrane system and nuclear envelope may have been formed by infolding and then fusion of the cell membrane.
7.5.0.0.3.2	(B) The endosymbiosis theory proposes that some organelles may be descended from prokaryotes that were engulfed by other, larger cells.
7.5.0.0.4.1	A bacterium with enclosed compartments would have several evolutionary advantages.
7.5.0.0.4.2	Chemicals could be concentrated in particular regions of the cell, allowing chemical reactions to proceed more efficiently.
7.5.0.0.4.3	A biochemical process could be segregated within an organelle with, for example, a different pH from the rest of the cell, creating more favorable conditions for that process.
7.5.0.0.4.4	Finally, gene transcription could be separated from translation, providing more opportunities for separate control of these steps in gene expression.
7.5.0.0.1.1	Symbiosis means    living together,  ? and often refers to two organisms that coexist, each one supplying something that the other needs.
7.5.0.0.1.2	With the theory of endosymbiosis biologists have proposed that some organelles   the mitochondria and the plastids   arose not by an infolding of the cell membrane but by one cell ingesting (but not digesting) another cell, giving rise to a symbiotic relationship.
7.5.0.0.1.3	Eventually, the ingested cell lost its autonomy and some of its functions.
7.5.0.0.1.4	In addition, many of the ingested cell   s genes were transferred to the host   s DNA.
7.5.0.0.1.5	Mitochondria and plastids in today   s eukaryotic cells are the remnants of these symbionts, retaining some specialized functions that benefit their host cells.
7.5.0.0.2.1	Consider the case of the plastid.
7.5.0.0.2.2	About 2.5 billion years ago some prokaryotes (the cyanobacteria) developed photosynthesis.
7.5.0.0.2.3	The emergence of these prokaryotes was a key event in the evolution of complex organisms because they increased the O2 concentration in Earth   s atmosphere (see Key Concept 25.2).
7.5.0.0.3.1	According to the endosymbiosis theory, photosynthetic prokaryotes also provided the precursor of the modern-day plastid.
7.5.0.0.3.2	Cells without cell walls can engulf relatively large particles by phagocytosis (see Figure 5.10).
7.5.0.0.3.3	In some cases, such as that of phagocytes in the human immune system, the engulfed particle can be an entire cell, such as a bacterium.
7.5.0.0.3.4	Plastids may have arisen by a similar event involving an ancestral eukaryote and a cyanobacterium (Figure 5.23B).
7.5.0.0.4.1	investigatinglife
7.5.0.0.5.1	Are pigments compartmentalized in all types of cells?
7.5.0.0.6.1	In this chapter, you learned of several situations in which pigments are concentrated in discrete organelles: in humans, melanin is packaged in melanosomes in human skin cells; in plants, tannins are packaged in tannosomes, chlorophyll is packaged in thylakoids, other pigments are contained in chromoplasts, and anthocyanins that may attract pollinators and seed dispersers are packaged in the vacuoles in petals and fruits.
7.5.0.0.6.2	You learned, too, of the remarkable ability of motor proteins to move pigment granules into the center of cells in fish and amphibians, to lighten their skin color as a defensive mechanism.
7.5.0.0.7.1	Many biological traits and adaptations are linked to pigments in organelles.
7.5.0.0.7.2	For example, the distribution of melanosomes is related to eye color, genetically determined errors in the formation of melanosomes can lead to albinism, and a lack of protection against ultraviolet light.
7.5.0.0.7.3	In plants, the formation of tannosomes is associated with plant defenses (see Chapter 38).
7.5.0.0.7.4	Understanding the pathway by which tannosomes are formed could have beneficial applications in agriculture.
7.5.0.0.7.5	For example, tannins are important to the taste of red wine and manipulating tannin concentrations can result in new flavors.
7.5.0.0.8.1	Future directions
7.5.0.0.9.1	The most common form of human cancer is skin cancer.
7.5.0.0.9.2	Most skin cancers are easily treated, but a rare type, melanoma, can be lethal.
7.5.0.0.9.3	As its name implies, melanoma occurs when melanocytes in the skin multiply excessively.
7.5.0.0.9.4	This can happen if melanocytes are exposed to ultraviolet light from the sun in excess of the ability of their melanin pigment to absorb it.
7.5.0.0.9.5	As the tumor develops, it often becomes resistant to the drugs used to treat it.
7.5.0.0.9.6	Recent research indicates that one way that drug resistance develops is that the drugs get sucked up by melanosomes and stay in the compartments, preventing them from getting to their targets elsewhere in the cell.
7.5.0.0.9.7	Biologists are trying to develop drugs that target melanosomes to prevent this drug sequestration.
7.5.0.0.10.1	5.5 recap
7.5.0.0.11.1	Eukaryotic cells arose long after prokaryotic cells.

7.5.0.0.16.1	How could membrane infolding in a prokaryotic cell lead to the formation of the endomembrane system?
7.5.0.0.17.1	When they are removed from a cell, organelles such as mitochondria no longer function as they did inside the cell.
7.5.0.0.17.2	What aspect of endosymbiotic theory explains this observation?
7.5.0.0.18.1	In this chapter we presented an overview of the components of cells, with some ideas about their structures, functions, and origins.
7.5.0.0.18.2	As you now embark on the study of major cellular processes, keep in mind that cellular components do not exist in isolation: they are part of a dynamic, interacting system.
7.5.0.0.18.3	In Chapter 6 you will see that the cell membrane is far from a passive barrier, but instead is a multifunctional system that connects the inside of the cell with its extracellular environment.

7.5.summary.36.6	Expression of these fused genes produces    fusion proteins  ? that retain their normal biological functions but have fluorescent tags that allow the proteins to be tracked.
7.5.summary.37.1	Researchers followed such a fusion protein through a mammalian cell using microscopy.
7.5.summary.37.2	They fused genetic sequences from green fluorescent protein to the gene encoding a protein from a virus.
7.5.summary.37.3	When this virus infects a cell, it directs the cell to make this protein and insert it into the cell membrane.
7.5.summary.37.4	The membrane is used to package new viruses.
7.5.summary.37.5	By choosing this protein, the researchers identified a nice system for following a protein   s movements through a cell.

7.6.9.1	Sweating and Membranes
7.6.10.1	During World War II, Winston Churchill told the British Parliament,    I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.  ?
7.6.10.2	He may not have known that the last two, tears and sweat, are transported across cell membranes inside vesicles.
7.6.10.3	As you saw in Chapter 2, sweating is a way to reduce body heat by using excess heat to evaporate water.
7.6.10.4	At peak activity, we may lose as much as 2 liters of water an hour, and if you know about the German air attacks on London during the war, you know that the people indeed toiled hard and must have sweated a lot.
7.6.11.1	The sweat glands lie just below the surface of the skin.
7.6.11.2	They are essentially cell-lined tubes surrounded by extracellular fluid.
7.6.11.3	When sweating is triggered, these tubes fill with water and dissolved substances.
7.6.11.4	To get from the extracellular fluid into the tube, water must go through the cells that line the tube.
7.6.12.1	A hallmark of living cells is the ability to regulate what enters and leaves the cytoplasm.
7.6.12.2	This is a function of the cell membrane, a hydrophobic lipid bilayer with associated proteins.
7.6.12.3	Because it is insoluble in the aqueous environment both inside and outside cells, the membrane is a physical barrier.
7.6.12.4	But it is also a functional barrier.
7.6.12.5	Whereas water is polar, the interior of the membrane is nonpolar   so water has a natural tendency to avoid the membrane.
7.6.12.6	The rate of movement of water across a lipid bilayer is modest.
7.6.12.7	When you engage in normal activities such as reading this book, the cell membranes enclosing the cells lining the sweat glands do not allow much water to enter or leave.
7.6.12.8	But when you exercise vigorously, tiny membrane-enclosed vesicles inside the cells fill with water and some dissolved salts.
7.6.12.9	In a process called exocytosis, these vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and release their watery contents (sweat) into the tubes.
7.6.12.10	From there the sweat flows to the surface of the skin and evaporates.
7.6.13.1	Vesicles are not the only way to get polar water across a nonpolar membrane.
7.6.13.2	In the mammalian kidney, and in plant roots, stems, and leaves, special pores called aquaporins occur in the cell membrane.
7.6.13.3	Water can flow through them readily because the proteins lining the channel have a hydrophilic inner surface.
7.6.14.1	What is the importance of aquaporin membrane channels?
7.6.15.1	Chapter 6 continues with
7.6.16.1	6.1  Biological Membranes Are Lipid   Protein Bilayers
7.6.1.1.1	Lipids form the hydrophobic core of the membrane
7.6.1.2.1	Membrane proteins are asymmetrically distributed
7.6.1.3.1	Membranes are constantly changing
7.6.1.4.1	Cell membrane carbohydrates are recognition sites
7.6.1.5.1	The physical organization and functioning of all biological membranes depend on their constituents: lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates.
7.6.1.5.2	You are already familiar with these molecules from Chapter 3 and with membranes that enclose cells and organelles from Chapter 5.
7.6.1.5.3	Lipids establish the physical integrity of the membrane and create a barrier to the rapid passage of hydrophilic materials such as water and ions.
7.6.1.5.4	In addition, the phospholipid bilayer serves as a lipid    lake  ? in which a variety of proteins    float  ?
7.6.1.5.5	(Focus: Key Figure 6.1).
7.6.1.5.6	This general design is known as the fluid mosaic model.
7.6.1.5.7	It is mosaic because it is made up of many discrete components, and fluid because the components can move freely.
7.6.1.6.1	focus: key figure
7.6.1.7.1	Figure 6.1 The Fluid Mosaic Model
7.6.1.8.1	The general molecular structure of a biological membrane is a continuous phospholipid bilayer that has proteins embedded in it or associated with it.
7.6.1.9.1	Q: What kinds of chemical interactions hold some membrane proteins embedded in the membrane and others on the membrane surface?
7.6.1.10.1	focus your learning
7.6.1.11.1	A lipid bilayer forms as the result of two kinds of inter-actions: hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar tails of phospholipids, and hydrophilic interactions between polar heads of phospholipids and water molecules.
7.6.1.12.1	Proteins associated with membranes may be embedded in the lipid bilayer or associated with exposed parts of the membrane.
7.6.1.13.1	Membranes are dynamic structures that undergo constant change.
7.6.1.14.1	The degree of a membrane   s fluidity is influenced by lipid composition and temperature.
7.6.1.15.1	The fluid mosaic model depicts proteins as noncovalently embedded in the phospholipid bilayer by their hydrophobic regions (or domains) or tethered to lipids inserted into the membrane.
7.6.1.15.2	Proteins may span the membrane or may be bound on the surface.
7.6.1.15.3	Their hydrophilic regions are exposed to the watery conditions on either side of the bilayer.
7.6.1.15.4	Membrane proteins have several functions, including moving materials through the membrane and receiving chemical signals from the cell   s external environment.
7.6.1.15.5	Each membrane has a set of proteins suitable for the specialized functions of the cell or organelle it surrounds.
7.6.1.16.1	The carbohydrates associated with membranes are attached either to the lipids or to protein molecules.
7.6.1.16.2	In cell membranes, carbohydrates are located on the outside of the cell, where they may interact with substances in the external environment.
7.6.1.16.3	Like some of the membrane proteins, carbohydrates are crucial in recognizing specific molecules, such as those on the surfaces of adjacent cells.
7.6.1.17.1	Although the fluid mosaic model is largely valid for membrane structure, it does not say much about membrane composition.
7.6.1.17.2	As you read about the various molecules in membranes in the next sections, keep in mind that some membranes have more protein than lipids, others are lipid-rich, others have significant amounts of cholesterol or other sterols, and still others are rich in carbohydrates.
7.6.1.1.1.1	The lipids in biological membranes are usually *phospholipids.
7.6.1.1.1.2	Recall from Key Concept 2.2 that some compounds are hydrophilic (   water-loving  ?) and others are hydrophobic (   water-hating  ?), and from Key Concept 3.4 that a phospholipid molecule has regions of both kinds:
7.6.1.1.2.1	Hydrophilic regions: The phosphate-containing    head  ? of the phospholipid is electrically charged and therefore associates with polar water molecules.
7.6.1.1.3.1	Hydrophobic regions: The long, nonpolar fatty acid    tails  ? of the phospholipid associate with other nonpolar materials; they do not dissolve in water or associate with hydrophilic substances.
7.6.1.1.4.1	*connect the concepts The straight chains of fatty acids allow phospholipids to pack closely together.
7.6.1.1.4.2	Review the molecular structure and properties of phospholipids in Key Concept 3.4.
7.6.1.1.5.1	The chemical properties of phospholipids are such that when phospholipids coexist with water, they form a bilayer, with the fatty acid    tails  ? of the two layers interacting with each other and the polar    heads  ? facing the outside aqueous environment (Figure 6.2).
7.6.1.1.5.2	The thickness of a biological membrane is about 8 nanometers (0.008   m), which is twice the length of a typical phospholipid   another indication that the membrane consists of a lipid bilayer.
7.6.1.1.5.3	To give you an idea of the scale, a typical sheet of paper is about 8,000 times thicker than this.
7.6.1.1.5.4	Figure 6.2  Phospholipid Bilayer
7.6.1.1.6.1	All biological membranes have a similar structure, but they differ in the kinds of proteins and lipids they contain.
7.6.1.1.6.2	Membranes from different cells or organelles may differ greatly in their lipid composition.
7.6.1.1.6.3	Phospholipids can differ in terms of fatty acid chain length (number of carbon atoms), degree of unsaturation (number of double bonds) in the fatty acids, and the polar groups present (see Chapter 3).
7.6.1.1.6.4	The saturated chains allow close packing of fatty acids in the bilayer, whereas the    kinks  ? in unsaturated fatty acids (see Figure 3.21) make for a less dense, more fluid packing.
7.6.1.1.7.1	Up to 25 percent of the lipid content of an animal cell   s cell membrane may be the steroid cholesterol (see Key Concept 3.4).
7.6.1.1.7.2	Cholesterol preferentially associates with saturated fatty acids.
7.6.1.1.7.3	When present, cholesterol is important for membrane integrity; the cholesterol in your membranes is not hazardous to your health.
7.6.1.1.8.1	The fatty acids of the phospholipids make the hydrophobic interior of the membrane somewhat fluid   about as fluid as lightweight olive oil.
7.6.1.1.8.2	This fluidity permits some molecules to move laterally within the plane of the membrane.
7.6.1.1.9.1	A given phospholipid molecule in the cell membrane can travel from one end of the cell to the other in a little more than a second!
7.6.1.1.9.2	However, a phospholipid molecule in one half of the bilayer is unlikely to spontaneously flip over to the other side.
7.6.1.1.9.3	For that to happen, the polar part of the molecule would have to move through the hydrophobic interior of the membrane.
7.6.1.1.9.4	Since spontaneous phospholipid flip-flops are rare, the inner and outer halves of the bilayer may be quite different in the kinds of phospholipids they contain.
7.6.1.1.10.1	Membrane fluidity is affected by several factors, two of which are particularly important:
7.6.1.1.11.1	Lipid composition: Cholesterol and long-chain, saturated fatty acids pack tightly beside one another, with little room for movement.
7.6.1.1.11.2	This close packing results in less-fluid membranes.
7.6.1.1.11.3	A membrane with shorter-chain fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids, or less cholesterol is more fluid.
7.6.1.1.12.1	Temperature: Because molecules move more slowly and fluidity decreases at reduced temperatures, cellular processes that take place within the membrane may slow down or stop under cold conditions in organisms that cannot keep their bodies warm.
7.6.1.1.12.2	To address this problem, in some organisms the lipid composition of their membranes changes when they get cold, replacing saturated with unsaturated fatty acids and using fatty acids with shorter tails.
7.6.1.1.12.3	These changes play a role in the survival of plants, bacteria, and hibernating animals during the winter.
7.6.1.2.0.1.1	All biological membranes contain proteins.
7.6.1.2.0.1.2	Typically, cell membranes have 1 protein molecule for every 25 lipid molecules.
7.6.1.2.0.1.3	This ratio varies depending on membrane function.
7.6.1.2.0.1.4	In the inner membrane of the mitochondrion, which is specialized for energy processing, there is 1 protein for every 15 lipids.
7.6.1.2.0.1.5	However, myelin   a modified cell membrane that encloses portions of some neurons (nerve cells) and acts as an electrical insulator   has only 1 protein for every 70 lipids.
7.6.1.2.0.2.1	Membrane proteins are very diverse.
7.6.1.2.0.2.2	In fact, about one-fourth of the protein-coding genes in the eukaryotic genome encode membrane proteins.
7.6.1.2.0.2.3	There are two general types of membrane proteins: integral proteins and peripheral proteins.
7.6.1.2.0.3.1	Integral membrane proteins are at least partly embedded in the phospholipid bilayer (see Figure 6.1).
7.6.1.2.0.3.2	Like phospholipids, these proteins have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions (domains) (Figure 6.3).
7.6.1.2.0.3.3	Figure 6.3  Interactions of Integral Membrane Proteins
7.6.1.2.0.4.1	Hydrophilic domains: Stretches of amino acids with hydrophilic side chains (R groups; see Table 3.2) give certain regions of the protein a polar character.
7.6.1.2.0.4.2	These hydrophilic domains interact with water and stick out into the aqueous environment inside or outside the cell.
7.6.1.2.0.5.1	Hydrophobic domains: Stretches of amino acids with hydrophobic side chains give other regions of the protein a nonpolar character.
7.6.1.2.0.5.2	These domains interact with the fatty acids in the interior of the phospholipid bilayer, away from water.
7.6.1.2.0.5.3	Some proteins contain covalently linked lipids such as fatty acid chains that do the job of inserting into the membrane (instead of the protein having hydrophobic amino acid regions).
7.6.1.2.0.6.1	Peripheral membrane proteins lack exposed hydrophobic groups and are not embedded in the bilayer.
7.6.1.2.0.6.2	Instead, they have polar or charged regions that interact with exposed parts of integral membrane proteins, or with the polar heads of phospholipid molecules (see Figure 6.1).
7.6.1.2.0.7.1	A special preparation method for electron microscopy, called freeze-fracturing, reveals proteins that are embedded in the phospholipid bilayers of cellular membranes (Figure 6.4).
7.6.1.2.0.7.2	When the two lipid leaflets (or layers) that make up the bilayer are separated, the proteins can be seen as bumps that protrude from the interior of each membrane.
7.6.1.2.0.7.3	The bumps are not observed when artificial bilayers of pure lipid are freeze-fractured.
7.6.1.2.0.8.1	research tools
7.6.1.2.0.9.1	Figure 6.4 Membrane Proteins Revealed by the Freeze-Fracture Technique
7.6.1.2.0.10.1	This HeLa cell (a human cell) membrane was first frozen to immobilize the lipids and proteins, and then fractured so that the bilayer was split open.
7.6.1.2.0.11.1	Membrane proteins and lipids generally interact only noncovalently.
7.6.1.2.0.11.2	The polar ends of proteins can interact with the polar ends of lipids, and the nonpolar regions of both molecules can interact hydrophobically.
7.6.1.2.0.11.3	As mentioned above, however, some membrane proteins have hydrophobic lipid components covalently attached to them that allow these proteins to tether themselves to the phospholipid bilayer.
7.6.1.2.0.12.1	Proteins are asymmetrically distributed on the inner and outer surfaces of membranes.
7.6.1.2.0.12.2	An integral protein that extends all the way through the phospholipid bilayer and protrudes on both sides is known as a transmembrane protein.
7.6.1.2.0.12.3	In addition to one or more transmembrane domains that extend through the bilayer, such a protein may have domains with other specific functions on the inner and outer sides of the membrane.
7.6.1.2.0.12.4	Peripheral membrane proteins, by contrast, are located on one side of the membrane or the other.
7.6.1.2.0.12.5	This asymmetrical arrangement of membrane proteins gives the two surfaces of the membrane different properties.
7.6.1.2.0.12.6	As you will soon see, these differences have great functional significance.
7.6.1.2.0.13.1	Like lipids, some membrane proteins move around relatively freely within the phospholipid bilayer.
7.6.1.2.0.13.2	Experiments that involve the technique of cell fusion illustrate this migration dramatically.
7.6.1.2.0.13.3	When two cells are fused, a single continuous membrane forms and surrounds both cells, and some proteins from each cell distribute themselves uniformly around this membrane (Figure 6.5).

7.6.1.2.0.17.1	Two animal cells can be fused together in the laboratory, forming a single large cell (heterokaryon).
7.6.1.2.0.17.2	This phenomenon was used to test whether membrane proteins can diffuse independently in the plane of the cell membrane.
7.6.1.2.0.18.1	HYPOTHESIS Proteins embedded in a membrane can diffuse freely within the membrane.
7.6.1.2.0.19.1	METHOD
7.6.1.2.0.20.1	CONCLUSION Membrane proteins can diffuse rapidly in the plane of the membrane.
7.6.1.2.0.21.1	Although some proteins are free to migrate in the membrane, others are not, but rather appear to be    anchored  ? to a specific region of the membrane.
7.6.1.2.0.21.2	These membrane regions are like an enclosure of animals at the zoo: the animals are free to move around within the fenced area but not outside it.
7.6.1.2.0.21.3	An example is the protein in the cell membrane of a muscle cell that recognizes a chemical signal from a neuron.
7.6.1.2.0.21.4	This protein is normally found only at the specific region where the neuron meets the muscle cell.
7.6.1.2.0.21.5	Proteins inside the cell can restrict the movement of proteins within a membrane.
7.6.1.2.0.21.6	The cytoskeleton has components just below the inner face of the membrane that are attached to membrane proteins protruding into the cytoplasm.
7.6.1.2.0.21.7	The stability of the cytoskeletal components may thus restrict movement of attached membrane proteins.
7.6.1.3.1.1	Membranes in eukaryotic cells are constantly forming, transforming from one type to another, fusing with one another, and breaking down.
7.6.1.3.1.2	As we discussed in Chapter 5, fragments of membrane move, in the form of vesicles, from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus, and from the Golgi apparatus to the cell membrane (see Figure 5.9).
7.6.1.3.1.3	Secondary lysosomes form when primary lysosomes from the Golgi apparatus fuse with phagosomes from the cell membrane (see Figure 5.10).
7.6.1.3.2.1	Because all membranes appear similar under the electron microscope, and because they interconvert readily, we might expect all subcellular membranes to be chemically identical.
7.6.1.3.2.2	However, that is not the case: there are major chemical differences among the membranes of even a single eukaryotic cell.
7.6.1.3.2.3	Membranes are changed chemically when they form parts of certain organelles.
7.6.1.3.2.4	In the Golgi apparatus, for example, the membranes of the cis face closely resemble those of the ER in chemical composition, but those of the trans face are more similar to the cell membrane.
7.6.1.4.1.1	In addition to lipids and proteins, the cell membrane contains carbohydrates (see Figure 6.1).
7.6.1.4.1.2	The carbohydrates are located on the outer surface of the cell membrane and serve as recognition sites for other cells and molecules, as you will see in Key Concept 6.2.
7.6.1.4.2.1	Membrane-associated carbohydrates may be covalently bonded to lipids or to proteins:
7.6.1.4.3.1	A glycolipid consists of a carbohydrate covalently bonded to a lipid.
7.6.1.4.3.2	Extending out from the cell surface, the carbohydrate may serve as a recognition signal for interactions between cells.
7.6.1.4.3.3	For example, the carbohydrates on some glycolipids change when cells become cancerous.
7.6.1.4.3.4	This change may allow white blood cells to target cancer cells for destruction.
7.6.1.4.4.1	A glycoprotein consists of one or more short carbohydrate chains covalently bonded to a protein.
7.6.1.4.4.2	The bound carbohydrates are oligosaccharides, usually not exceeding 15 monosaccharide units in length (see Key Concept 3.3).
7.6.1.4.4.3	A proteoglycan (see Key Concept 5.4) is a more heavily glycosylated protein: it has more carbohydrate molecules attached to it, and the carbohydrate chains are often longer than they are in glycoproteins.
7.6.1.4.4.4	The carbohydrates of glycoproteins and proteoglycans often function in cell recognition and adhesion.
7.6.1.4.5.1	The    alphabet  ? of monosaccharides on the outer surfaces of membranes can generate a large diversity of messages.
7.6.1.4.5.2	Recall from Key Concept 3.3 that monosaccharides are simple carbohydrates, often containing five or six carbons in a ring structure, which can bond with one another in various configurations.
7.6.1.4.5.3	They may form linear or branched oligosaccharides with many different three-dimensional shapes.
7.6.1.4.5.4	An oligosaccharide of a specific shape on one cell can bind to a complementary shape on an adjacent cell.
7.6.1.4.5.5	This binding is the basis of cell   cell adhesion.
7.6.1.4.6.1	6.1 recap
7.6.1.4.7.1	The fluid mosaic model applies to the cell membrane and the membranes of organelles.
7.6.1.4.7.2	In the aqueous environment of the cell, phospholipids spontaneously assemble into a bilayer.
7.6.1.4.7.3	The cell membrane is considered fluid because the phospholipids and some of the proteins that compose it can move within their monolayer.
7.6.1.4.7.4	An integral membrane protein has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains, which affect its position and function in the membrane.
7.6.1.4.7.5	Peripheral membrane proteins are bound to one side or the other of the membrane.
7.6.1.4.7.6	Carbohydrates that attach to lipids and proteins on the outside of the membrane serve as recognition and adhesion sites for adjacent cells.

7.6.1.4.17.2	How would you investigate the observation that the cancer cell membrane is more fluid, with more rapid diffusion in the plane of the membrane of both lipids and proteins?
7.6.1.4.18.1	Now that you understand the structure of biological membranes, let   s see how their components function.
7.6.1.4.18.2	In the next section we   ll focus on the membrane that surrounds individual cells: the cell membrane.
7.6.1.4.18.3	We   ll then look at how the cell membrane allows individual cells to be grouped together into multicellular systems of tissues.

7.6.2.5.1	Cell recognition, in which one cell specifically recognizes and binds to another cell of a certain type
7.6.2.6.1	Cell adhesion, in which the connection between the two cells is strengthened
7.6.2.7.1	Both processes involve the cell membrane.
7.6.2.7.2	One way to study these processes is to break down a tissue into its individual cells and then allow them to adhere to one another again.
7.6.2.7.3	This type of experiment is most easily done in relatively simple organisms, such as sponges, which provide good models for studying processes that also occur in the complex tissues of larger species.
7.6.2.8.1	focus your learning
7.6.2.9.1	Cell adhesion and cell recognition are specific and depend on protein and carbohydrate molecules present on the cell membrane.
7.6.2.10.1	After two cells recognize and bind to one another, they can contribute additional material to form stable cell junctions that enhance protective, structural, or communication functions in the organism.
7.6.2.11.1	Sponges are multicellular marine animals that have only a few distinct cell layers (see Key Concept 30.5).
7.6.2.11.2	The cells of a sponge adhere to one another but can be separated mechanically by passing the animal several times through a fine wire screen (Figure 6.6).
7.6.2.11.3	Through this process, what was a single animal becomes hundreds of individual cells suspended in seawater.
7.6.2.11.4	If such cells are stirred gently for a few hours, cell recognition occurs: the cells bump into and recognize one another, sticking together in the same shape and tissue organization as the original sponge.
7.6.2.11.5	This recognition is species-specific; if disaggregated sponge cells from two different species are placed in the same container and shaken, individual cells will stick only to other cells of the same species.
7.6.2.11.6	Two different sponges form, just like the ones at the start of the experiment.
7.6.2.11.7	Figure 6.6 Cell Recognition and Adhesion
7.6.2.12.1	Such tissue-specific and species-specific cell recognition and cell adhesion are essential to the formation and maintenance of tissues in multicellular organisms.
7.6.2.12.2	Think of your own body.
7.6.2.12.3	What keeps muscle cells bound to muscle cells and skin to skin?
7.6.2.12.4	Specific cell adhesion is so obvious a characteristic of complex organisms that it is easy to overlook.
7.6.2.12.5	You will see many examples of specific cell adhesion throughout this book; here we describe its general principles.
7.6.2.12.6	As you will see, cell recognition and cell adhesion depend on cell membrane proteins.
7.6.2.1.1.1	The molecules responsible for cell recognition and adhesion in sponges are proteoglycans (often 80% carbohydrate by molecular weight) that carry two kinds of carbohydrates.
7.6.2.1.1.2	One kind is relatively small and binds to membrane components, keeping the proteoglycan attached to the cell.
7.6.2.1.1.3	The other kind of carbohydrate is a larger, sulfated polysaccharide.
7.6.2.1.1.4	If the sulfated polysaccharide from a particular species of sponge is purified and attached to cellulose beads, the beads will aggregate together or with sponge cells   but only with cells of the same species from which the polysaccharide was purified.
7.6.2.1.1.5	This demonstrates that the sulfated polysaccharide is responsible for both the specific recognition and adhesion of the sponge cells.
7.6.2.1.2.1	Cell adhesion can result from interactions between the carbohydrates that are parts of glycolipids, glycoproteins, or proteoglycans   as is the case in sponge cells.
7.6.2.1.2.2	In other cases, a carbohydrate on one cell interacts with a membrane protein on another cell.
7.6.2.1.2.3	Or two proteins can interact directly.
7.6.2.1.2.4	As we described in Key Concept 3.2, a protein not only has a specific shape, it also has specific chemical groups exposed on its surface where they can interact with other substances, including other proteins.
7.6.2.1.2.5	Both of these features allow binding to other specific molecules.
7.6.2.1.2.6	Cell adhesion occurs in all kinds of multicellular organisms.
7.6.2.1.2.7	In plants, cell adhesion may be mediated by both integral membrane proteins and specific carbohydrates in the cell walls.
7.6.2.1.3.1	In most cases, the binding of cells in a tissue is homotypic; that is, the same molecule sticks out of both cells, and the exposed surfaces fit together and bind to each other.
7.6.2.1.3.2	This is a factor that keeps skin cells together in a sheet of cells.
7.6.2.1.3.3	But heterotypic binding (between different molecules on different cells) also occurs.
7.6.2.1.3.4	In this case, chemical groups on different surface molecules have an affinity for one another.
7.6.2.1.3.5	For example, when the mammalian sperm meets the egg, different proteins on the two types of cells have complementary binding surfaces.
7.6.2.1.3.6	Similarly, some algae form male and female reproductive cells (analogous to sperm and eggs) that have flagella to propel them toward each other.
7.6.2.1.3.7	Male and female cells can recognize each other by heterotypic glycoproteins on their flagella.
7.6.2..title.1.1	In a complex multicellular organism, cell recognition molecules allow specific types of cells to bind to one another.
7.6.2..title.1.2	Often, after the initial binding, both cells contribute material to form additional membrane structures that connect them to one another.
7.6.2..title.1.3	These specialized structures, called cell junctions, are most evident in electron micrographs of epithelial tissues, which are layers of cells that line body cavities or cover body surfaces.
7.6.2..title.1.4	These surfaces often receive stresses or must retain their contents under pressure, so it is particularly important that their cells adhere tightly.
7.6.2..title.1.5	We will examine three types of cell junctions that enable animal cells to seal intercellular spaces, reinforce attachments to one another, and communicate with each other.
7.6.2..title.1.6	Tight junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions, respectively, perform these three functions (Figure 6.7).
7.6.2..title.1.7	Figure 6.7 Junctions Link Animal Cells Together
7.6.2..title.2.1	Tight junctions prevent substances from moving through the spaces between cells.
7.6.2..title.2.2	For example, cells lining the bladder have tight junctions so urine cannot leak out into the body cavity.
7.6.2..title.2.3	Another important function of tight junctions is to maintain distinct faces of a cell within a tissue by restricting the migration of membrane proteins over the cell surface from one face to the other.
7.6.2..title.2.4	This may result in a certain function (e. g. , endocytosis) being confined to one region of the cell surface.
7.6.2..title.3.1	Desmosomes hold neighboring cells firmly together, acting like spot welds or rivets.
7.6.2..title.3.2	Materials can still move around in the extracellular matrix.
7.6.2..title.3.3	This provides mechanical stability for tissues such as skin that receive physical stress.
7.6.2..title.4.1	Gap junctions are channels that run between membrane pores in adjacent cells, allowing substances to pass between cells.
7.6.2..title.4.2	In the heart, for example, gap junctions allow the rapid spread of electric current (mediated by ions) so the heart muscle cells beat in unison.
7.6.2.3.1.1	In Key Concept 5.4 you learned about the extracellular matrix of animal cells, which is composed of collagen protein arranged in fibers in a gelatinous matrix of proteoglycans.
7.6.2.3.1.2	The attachment of a cell to the extracellular matrix is important in maintaining the integrity of a tissue.
7.6.2.3.1.3	In addition, some cells can detach from their neighbors, move, and attach to other cells; this is often mediated by interactions with the extracellular matrix.
7.6.2.3.2.1	A transmembrane protein called integrin often mediates the attachment of epithelial cells to the extracellular matrix (Figure 6.8A).
7.6.2.3.2.2	More than 24 different integrins have been described in human cells.
7.6.2.3.2.3	All of them bind to a protein in the extracellular matrix outside the cell, and to actin filaments, which are part of the cytoskeleton, inside the cell.
7.6.2.3.2.4	So in addition to adhesion, integrin has a role in maintaining cell structure via its interaction with the cytoskeleton.
7.6.2.3.2.5	Figure 6.8 Integrins and the Extracellular Matrix
7.6.2.3.3.1	(A) Integrins mediate the attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix.
7.6.2.3.3.2	(B) Cell movements are mediated by integrin attachment.
7.6.2.3.4.1	The binding of integrin to the extracellular matrix is noncovalent and reversible.
7.6.2.3.4.2	When a cell moves its location within a tissue or organism, one side of the cell detaches from the extracellular matrix while the other side extends in the direction of movement, forming new attachments in that direction (Figure 6.8B).
7.6.2.3.4.3	The integrin at the    back  ? of the cell (away from the direction of movement) is brought into the cytoplasm by endocytosis (see Key Concept 6.5) so that it can be recycled and used for new attachments at the    front  ? of the cell.
7.6.2.3.4.4	These events are important for cell movement within the developing embryo and for the spread of cancer cells.
7.6.2.3.5.1	6.2 recap
7.6.2.3.6.1	In multicellular organisms, cells arrange themselves into tissues via the processes of cell recognition and cell adhesion.
7.6.2.3.6.2	These processes are mediated by membrane-associated proteins and carbohydrates.
7.6.2.3.6.3	Cell membrane proteins also interact with the extracellular matrix.
7.6.2.3.6.4	Cell junctions assist in strengthening tissues and allow cells to communicate with one another.
7.6.2.3.7.1	learning outcomes
7.6.2.3.8.1	You should be able to:
7.6.2.3.9.1	Design investigations to analyze the function of proteins and carbohydrates in cell adhesion and cell recognition.
7.6.2.3.10.1	Compare and contrast the three types of cell junctions found in animals.
7.6.2.3.11.1	Describe an experiment showing a role for carbohydrates in cell recognition and adhesion.
7.6.2.3.12.1	To which of the three types of cell junctions are plasmodesmata most similar (see Figure 5.7B)?
7.6.2.3.13.1	You have seen how the cell membrane and molecules associated with it facilitate binding between cells and the maintenance of cell adhesion.
7.6.2.3.13.2	We   ll turn now to another major function of membranes: regulating the substances that enter or leave a cell or organelle.
7.6.2.3.14.1	Chapter 6 continues with
7.6.2.3.15.1	6.3 Substances Can Cross Membranes by Passive Processes
7.6.3.1.1	Diffusion is the process of random movement toward a state of equilibrium
7.6.3.2.1	Diffusion within Cells and Tissues
7.6.3.3.1	Diffusion Across Membranes
7.6.3.4.1	Simple diffusion takes place through the phospholipid bilayer
7.6.3.5.1	Osmosis is the diffusion of water across membranes
7.6.3.6.1	Diffusion may be aided by channel proteins

7.6.3.8.1	Aquaporins for Water
7.6.3.9.1	Carrier proteins aid diffusion by binding substances
7.6.3.10.1	As you have already learned, cellular membranes have many functions, and control of the cell   s internal composition is one of the most important.
7.6.3.10.2	Biological membranes allow some substances, but not others, to pass through them.
7.6.3.10.3	This characteristic of membranes is called selective permeability.
7.6.3.10.4	Selective permeability allows the membrane to determine what substances enter or leave a cell or organelle.
7.6.3.11.1	focus your learning
7.6.3.12.1	The rate of diffusion of a substance across a membrane is influenced by the size and mass of the diffusing particles, the temperature and the density of the solution, and the size of the concentration gradient.
7.6.3.13.1	Osmosis is diffusion of water across a biological membrane.
7.6.3.14.1	Proteins that act as channels facilitate diffusion across membranes.
7.6.3.15.1	There are two fundamentally different processes by which substances cross biological membranes:
7.6.3.16.1	The processes of passive transport do not require the input of chemical energy to drive them.
7.6.3.17.1	The processes of active transport are driven by chemical energy (metabolic energy).
7.6.3.18.1	This section focuses on the passive processes by which substances cross membranes.
7.6.3.18.2	The energy for the passive transport of a substance comes from the difference between its concentration on one side of the membrane and its concentration on the other   its concentration gradient.
7.6.3.18.3	Passive transport can involve either of two types of diffusion: simple diffusion through the phospholipid bilayer, or facilitated diffusion via channel proteins or carrier proteins.
7.6.3.1.1.1	In a solution, there is a tendency for all of the components to be evenly distributed.
7.6.3.1.1.2	You can see this when a drop of food coloring falls into a glass of water.
7.6.3.1.1.3	Initially the pigment molecules are very concentrated, but they will move about at random, slowly spreading until the intensity of the color is eventually the same throughout the glass.
7.6.3.1.2.1	A solution in which the solute particles are uniformly distributed is said to be at equilibrium because there will be no future net change in their concentration.
7.6.3.1.2.2	Being at equilibrium does not mean that the particles have stopped moving; it just means that they are moving in such a way that their overall distribution does not change.
7.6.3.1.3.1	Diffusion is the process of random movement toward a state of equilibrium.
7.6.3.1.3.2	Although the motion of each individual particle is absolutely random, the net movement of particles is directional until equilibrium is reached.
7.6.3.1.3.3	Diffusion is thus a net movement from regions of greater concentration to regions of lesser concentration.
7.6.3.1.3.4	In a solution with many different substances dissolved in it (solutes), the diffusion of each solute is independent of those of the others.
7.6.3.1.3.5	How fast a substance diffuses depends on four factors:
7.6.3.1.4.1	The size and mass of the molecules or ions: smaller molecules diffuse faster.
7.6.3.1.5.1	The temperature of the solution: higher temperatures lead to faster diffusion because ions or molecules have more energy, and thus move more rapidly, at higher temperatures.
7.6.3.1.6.1	The density of the solution: As the density of the solution through which a substance is diffusing increases, the diffusion rate decreases.
7.6.3.1.7.1	The concentration gradient in the system   that is, the change in solute concentration with distance in a given direction: the greater the concentration gradient, the more rapidly a substance diffuses.
7.6.3.1.8.1	In our example shown above, the gradient is the concentration of food coloring in the droplet when first dropped into the water as compared with the concentration of food coloring in the water on the edge of the glass.
7.6.3.1.8.2	When the food coloring is first dropped into the water, there is a high (or steep) concentration gradient.
7.6.3.1.8.3	As time passes and the coloring diffuses through the solution, the concentration gradient slowly decreases.
7.6.3.1.1.1.1	In a small volume such as that inside a cell, solutes distribute themselves rapidly by diffusion.
7.6.3.1.1.1.2	Small molecules and ions may move from one end of a cell to another in a millisecond (10   3 s, or one-thousandth of a second).
7.6.3.1.1.1.3	However, the usefulness of diffusion as a transport mechanism declines drastically as distances become greater.
7.6.3.1.1.1.4	In the absence of mechanical stirring, diffusion across more than a centimeter may take an hour or more, and diffusion across meters may take years!
7.6.3.1.1.1.5	Diffusion would not be adequate to distribute materials over the length of a human body, much less that of a larger organism.
7.6.3.1.1.1.6	But within our cells or across layers of one or two cells, diffusion is rapid enough to distribute small molecules and ions almost instantaneously.
7.6.3.1.1.1.7	This is not so when dehydration occurs and the cytoplasm becomes denser as water is lost.
7.6.3.1.1.1.8	Nerve cells in humans are very sensitive to this; when the body becomes dehydrated, unconsciousness may occur because substances important to nerve-cell function diffuse more slowly.
7.6.3.1.2.1.1	In a solution without barriers, all the solutes diffuse at rates determined by temperature, their physical properties, their concentration gradients, and the density of the solution.
7.6.3.1.2.1.2	If a biological membrane divides the solution into separate compartments, then the movement of the different solutes can be affected by the properties of the membrane.
7.6.3.1.2.1.3	The membrane is said to be permeable to solutes that can cross it more or less easily, but impermeable to substances that cannot move across it.
7.6.3.1.2.2.1	Molecules to which the membrane is impermeable remain in separate compartments, and their concentrations may be different on the two sides of the membrane.
7.6.3.1.2.2.2	Molecules to which the membrane is permeable diffuse from one compartment to the other until their concentrations are equal on both sides of the membrane, and equilibrium is reached.
7.6.3.1.2.2.3	After that point, individual molecules will continue to pass through the membrane, but there will be no net change in concentration.
7.6.3.2.1.1	In simple diffusion, small molecules pass through the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane.
7.6.3.2.1.2	A molecule that is itself hydrophobic, and is therefore soluble in lipids, enters the membrane readily and is able to pass through it.
7.6.3.2.1.3	The more lipid-soluble the molecule is, the more rapidly it diffuses through the membrane bilayer.
7.6.3.2.1.4	This statement holds true over a wide range of molecular weights.
7.6.3.2.1.5	Figure 6.9 Permeability of Phospholipid Bilayers
7.6.3.2.2.1	By contrast, electrically charged or polar molecules, such as amino acids, sugars, and ions, do not pass readily through a membrane, for two reasons.
7.6.3.2.2.2	First, such charged or polar molecules are not very soluble in the hydrophobic interior of the bilayer.
7.6.3.2.2.3	Second, such substances form many hydrogen bonds with water and ions in the aqueous environment, be it the cytoplasm or the cell exterior.
7.6.3.2.2.4	The multiplicity of these hydrogen bonds prevents the substances from moving into the hydrophobic interior of the membrane.
7.6.3.2.2.5	Figure 6.9 summarizes these phenomena.
7.6.3..title.1.1	Water molecules pass through specialized channels in membranes (see the opening story) by a diffusion process called *osmosis.
7.6.3..title.1.2	This completely passive process uses no metabolic energy and depends on the relative concentrations of the water molecules on each side of the membrane.
7.6.3..title.1.3	It is important that you remember that in a particular solution, the higher the total solute concentration, the lower the concentration of water molecules.
7.6.3..title.1.4	A membrane may allow water but not solutes to pass across it, and in that case, water will diffuse across the membrane toward the side with the higher solute (lower water) concentration.
7.6.3..title.2.1	*connect the concepts Osmosis plays key roles in plant physiology (e. g. , in the root; see Key Concept 34.1) and in animal physiology (e. g. , in the kidney; see Key Concept 51.1).
7.6.3..title.3.1	Three terms are used to compare the solute concentrations of two solutions separated by a membrane:
7.6.3..title.4.1	Isotonic solutions have equal solute concentrations (Figure 6.10A).
7.6.3..title.5.1	A hypotonic solution has a lower solute concentration than the other solution with which it is being compared (Figure 6.10B).
7.6.3..title.6.1	A hypertonic solution has a higher solute concentration than the other solution with which it is being compared (Figure 6.10C).
7.6.3..title.7.1	Figure 6.10 Osmosis Can Modify the Shapes of Cells
7.6.3..title.8.1	In a solution that is isotonic with the cytoplasm (A), a plant or animal cell maintains a consistent, characteristic shape because there is no net movement of water into or out of the cell.
7.6.3..title.8.2	In these models, it is assumed that the solutes do not move across the membrane.
7.6.3..title.8.3	In a solution that is hypotonic to the cytoplasm (B), water enters the cell.
7.6.3..title.8.4	An environment that is hypertonic to the cytoplasm (C) results in water leaving the cell.
7.6.3..title.9.1	Q: If you overfertilize the soil of a potted plant, the plant often wilts.
7.6.3..title.9.2	Why?
7.6.3..title.10.1	In general, when we discuss tonicity in cells, we refer to the outside solution in comparison to the inside of the cell.
7.6.3..title.10.2	Therefore a solution that has a higher concentration of solutes than the concentration inside the cell is hypertonic.
7.6.3..title.10.3	To reach equilibrium, water would move out of the cell into the surrounding solution.
7.6.3..title.10.4	Water moves from a hypotonic solution across a membrane to a hypertonic solution.
7.6.3..title.11.1	When we say that    water moves,  ? bear in mind that we are referring to the net movement of water.
7.6.3..title.11.2	Since it is so abundant, water is constantly moving through protein channels across the cell membrane into and out of cells.
7.6.3..title.11.3	What concerns us here is whether the overall movement is greater in one direction or the other.
7.6.3..title.12.1	The concentration of solutes in the environment determines the direction of osmosis in all animal cells.
7.6.3..title.12.2	A red blood cell takes up water from a solution that is hypotonic to the cell   s contents.
7.6.3..title.12.3	The cell bursts because its cell membrane cannot withstand the pressure created by the water entry and the resultant swelling.
7.6.3..title.12.4	Conversely, the cell shrinks if the solution surrounding it is hypertonic to its contents.
7.6.3..title.12.5	The integrity of red and white blood cells is absolutely dependent on the maintenance of a constant solute concentration in the blood plasma: the plasma must be isotonic to the blood cells if the cells are not to burst or shrink.
7.6.3..title.12.6	Regulation of the solute concentration of body fluids is thus an important process for organisms without cell walls.
7.6.3..title.12.7	Aquatic invertebrates usually have internal solute concentrations that match those of their aqueous environment.
7.6.3..title.12.8	However, fish often have a very different internal environment: for example, the environment around a fish living in a freshwater stream is hypotonic to the body fluids inside the fish.
7.6.3..title.12.9	Considerable chemical energy must be used to maintain this imbalance.
7.6.3..title.13.1	Unlike animal cells, the cells of plants, archaea, bacteria, fungi, and some protists have cell walls outside of their cell membrane that limit their volumes and keep them from bursting.
7.6.3..title.13.2	Cells with sturdy walls take up a limited amount of water, and in so doing they build up internal pressure against the cell wall, which prevents further water from entering.
7.6.3..title.13.3	This pressure within the cell is called turgor pressure.
7.6.3..title.13.4	Turgor pressure keeps plants upright (and lettuce crisp) and is the driving force for the enlargement of plant cells.
7.6.3..title.13.5	It is a normal and essential component of plant growth.
7.6.3..title.13.6	If enough water leaves the cells, turgor pressure drops and the plant wilts.
7.6.3..title.13.7	Turgor pressure reaches about 100 pounds per square inch (0.7 kg/cm2)   several times greater than the pressure in automobile tires.
7.6.3..title.13.8	This pressure is so great that the cells would change shape and detach from one another were it not for adhesive molecules in the plant cell walls and the plasmodesmata linking the cell cytoplasms (see Key Concept 5.4).
7.6.3.4.1.1	As we saw earlier, polar or charged substances such as water, amino acids, sugars, and ions do not readily diffuse across membranes.
7.6.3.4.1.2	But they can cross the hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer passively (that is, without the input of energy) in one of two ways, depending on the substance:
7.6.3.4.2.1	Channel proteins are integral membrane proteins that form channels across the membrane through which certain substances can pass.
7.6.3.4.2.2	Note that these are not channels in the widely used sense of the word (meaning open to the environment like a canal) but tunnels (surrounded by the membrane protein).
7.6.3.4.3.1	Carrier proteins bind substances and speed up their diffusion through the phospholipid bilayer.
7.6.3.4.4.1	Diffusion that is aided by channel proteins or carrier proteins is called facilitated diffusion.
7.6.3.4.4.2	The substances diffuse according to their concentration gradients, but their diffusion is facilitated by protein channels or carriers.
7.6.3.4.4.3	Although these proteins enhance the rate of diffusion, facilitated diffusion, like simple diffusion, does not require any input of energy.
7.6.3.4.1.1.1	The best-studied channel proteins are the ion channels.
7.6.3.4.1.1.2	As you will see in later chapters, the movement of ions across membranes is important in many biological processes such as respiration within the mitochondria, the electrical activity of the nervous system, and the opening of pores in leaves to allow gas exchange with the environment.
7.6.3.4.1.1.3	Several types of *ion channel have been identified   each specific for a particular ion.
7.6.3.4.1.1.4	All show the same basic structure of a hydrophilic pore that allows a particular ion to move through its center.
7.6.3.4.1.2.1	*connect the concepts Ion channels play an important role in the excitability of nervous tissues.
7.6.3.4.1.2.2	See Key Concept 45.2.
7.6.3.4.1.2.3	Figure 6.11 A Gated Channel Protein Opens in Response to a Stimulus
7.6.3.4.1.3.1	Just as a fence may have a gate that can be opened or closed, most ion channels are gated: they can be opened or closed to ion passage (Figure 6.11).
7.6.3.4.1.3.2	A gated channel opens when a stimulus causes a change in the three-dimensional shape of the channel.
7.6.3.4.1.3.3	In some cases, this stimulus is the binding of a chemical signal, or ligand (see Figure 6.11).
7.6.3.4.1.3.4	Channels controlled in this way are called ligand-gated channels.
7.6.3.4.1.3.5	Other channels are mechanically gated and open in response to physical stimuli such as sound waves in the ear.
7.6.3.4.1.3.6	A voltage-gated channel is stimulated to open or close by a change in the voltage (electric charge difference) across the membrane.
7.6.3.4.2.1.1	As you saw in the opening story of this chapter, water can cross membranes through protein channels called aquaporins.
7.6.3.4.2.1.2	These channels function as a cellular plumbing system for moving water.
7.6.3.4.2.1.3	The aquaporin channel is highly specific.
7.6.3.4.2.1.4	Water molecules move in single file through the channel, which excludes ions so that the electrical properties of the cell are maintained.
7.6.3.4.2.1.5	Aquaporins were first identified when a protein from red blood cell membranes was inserted into frog oocytes (immature egg cells).
7.6.3.4.2.1.6	The membranes of these cells are normally impermeable to water, but the membranes of the cells treated with aquaporins became much more permeable (Investigating Life: Aquaporins Increase Membrane Permeability to Water).
7.6.3.5.1.1	As we mentioned earlier, another type of facilitated diffusion involves the binding of the transported substance to a membrane protein called a carrier protein.
7.6.3.5.1.2	Like channel proteins, carrier proteins facilitate the passive diffusion of substances into or out of cells or organelles.
7.6.3.5.1.3	Carrier proteins transport polar molecules such as sugars and amino acids.
7.6.3.5.2.1	Glucose is the major energy source for most cells, and living systems require a great deal of it.
7.6.3.5.2.2	Glucose is polar and cannot readily diffuse across membranes.
7.6.3.5.2.3	Eukaryotic cell membranes contain a carrier protein   the glucose transporter   that facilitates glucose uptake into the cell.
7.6.3.5.2.4	Binding of glucose to a specific three-dimensional site on one side of the transporter protein causes the protein to change its shape and release glucose on the other side of the membrane (Figure 6.12A).
7.6.3.5.2.5	Since glucose is either broken down or otherwise removed almost as soon as it enters a cell, there is almost always a strong concentration gradient favoring glucose entry (that is, a higher concentration outside the cell than inside).
7.6.3.5.3.1	Figure 6.12 A Carrier Protein Facilitates Diffusion The glucose transporter is a carrier protein that allows glucose to enter the cell at a faster rate than would be possible by simple diffusion.
7.6.3.5.3.2	(A) The transporter binds to glucose, brings it into the membrane interior, then changes shape, releasing glucose into the cell cytoplasm.
7.6.3.5.3.3	(B) The graph shows the rate of glucose entry via a carrier versus the concentration of glucose outside the cell.
7.6.3.5.3.4	As the glucose concentration increases, the rate of diffusion increases until the point at which all the available transporters are being used (the system is saturated).
7.6.3.5.4.1	Transport by carrier proteins is different from simple diffusion.
7.6.3.5.4.2	In simple diffusion, the rate of movement depends on the concentration gradient across the membrane.
7.6.3.5.4.3	This is also true for carrier-mediated transport, up to a point.
7.6.3.5.4.4	In carrier-mediated transport, as the concentration gradient increases, the diffusion rate also increases, but its rate of increase slows, and a point is reached at which the diffusion rate becomes constant.
7.6.3.5.4.5	At this point, the facilitated diffusion system is said to be saturated (Figure 6.12B).
7.6.3.5.4.6	This is explained by the fact that a particular cell has a specific number of carrier protein molecules in its cell membrane.
7.6.3.5.5.1	The rate of diffusion reaches a maximum when all the carrier molecules are fully loaded with solute molecules.
7.6.3.5.5.2	Think of waiting for the elevator on the ground floor of a hotel with 50 other people.
7.6.3.5.5.3	You can   t all get in the elevator (carrier) at once, so the rate of transport (say, ten people at a time) is at its maximum, and the transport system is    saturated.  ?
7.6.3.5.5.4	As a consequence, cells that require large amounts of energy, such as muscle cells, have high concentrations of glucose transporters in their membranes so that the maximum rate of facilitated diffusion is greater.
7.6.3.5.5.5	Likewise, the human brain has high glucose needs, and the blood vessels that nourish it have high concentrations of glucose transporters.

7.6.3.5.10.1	A protein was isolated from the membranes of cells in which water diffuses rapidly across the membranes.
7.6.3.5.10.2	When the protein was inserted into oocytes, which do not normally have it, the water permeability of the oocytes was greatly increased.

7.6.3.5.12.1	CONCLUSION Aquaporin increases the rate of water diffusion across the cell membrane.
7.6.3.5.13.1	work with the data
7.6.3.5.14.1	Although diffusion can account for limited water movement across cell membranes, simple diffusion seemed unlikely to explain the considerable water movement in kidney and red blood cells.
7.6.3.5.14.2	By chance, Peter Agre and his colleagues found a major membrane protein, CHIP28, shared by these two cell types, and hypothesized that it was responsible for cell membrane water transport.
7.6.3.5.14.3	So they did a    what if  ? experiment, taking the mRNA for CHIP28 and injecting it into frog oocytes that do not normally make the protein.
7.6.3.5.15.1	QUESTIONS
7.6.3.5.16.1	Frog oocytes in isotonic liquid were injected with either a small amount of water (control) or with CHIP28 mRNA in a small amount of water.
7.6.3.5.16.2	The oocytes were then transferred to a hypotonic medium, and changes in relative cell volume were measured by microscopy.

7.6.3.5.24.1	To further investigate the role of CHIP28 in water transport, oocytes were given a known inhibitor of protein-mediated water transport, mercuric chloride, and then tested for water permeability with CHIP28 mRNA.
7.6.3.5.24.2	Some of the eggs were also treated with mercaptoethanol, a molecule that overcomes the inhibition of water transport by mercuric chloride.
7.6.3.5.24.3	The question was, would the inhibitor actually block water transport mediated by CHIP28, and would mercaptoethanol restore transport?

7.6.3.5.36.2	What is the role of the cell membrane in maintaining this imbalance?
7.6.3.5.36.3	How can K+ membrane channels eliminate this imbalance?
7.6.3.5.37.1	The process of diffusion tends to equalize the concentrations of substances outside and inside cells.
7.6.3.5.37.2	However, one hallmark of a living cell is that it can have an internal composition quite different from that of its environment.
7.6.3.5.37.3	To achieve this, a cell must sometimes move substances against their concentration gradients.
7.6.3.5.37.4	This process requires an input of energy and is known as active transport.
7.6.3.5.38.1	Chapter 6 continues with
7.6.3.5.39.1	6.4  Active Transport across Membranes Requires Energy
7.6.4.1.1	Active transport is directional
7.6.4.2.1	Different energy sources distinguish different active transport systems
7.6.4.3.1	In many biological situations, the concentration of a particular ion or small molecule inside the cell differs from that outside the cell.
7.6.4.3.2	Such imbalances are maintained by a protein in the cell membrane that moves the substance against its concentration and/or electrical gradient.
7.6.4.3.3	Movement of molecules or ions against a gradient is called active transport because it requires an input of energy.
7.6.4.3.4	Often the energy source is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which has chemical energy stored in its terminal phosphate bond.
7.6.4.3.5	In eukaryotes, ATP is produced in the mitochondria.
7.6.4.3.6	Energy is released in a hydrolysis reaction that breaks the terminal phosphate bond of ATP, converting it to adenosine diphosphate (ADP).
7.6.4.3.7	We will detail how ATP provides energy to cells in Key Concept 8.2.
7.6.4.4.1	The differences between diffusion and active transport are summarized in Table 6.1.

7.6.4.6.1	focus your learning
7.6.4.7.1	Active transport requires energy to move a substance against its concentration gradient.
7.6.4.8.1	Three kinds of membrane proteins are involved in active transport: uniporters, symporters, and antiporters.
7.6.4.9.1	Primary active transport uses ATP hydrolysis directly to provide the energy for transport, whereas secondary active transport uses an ion concentration gradient that was established by ATP hydrolysis.
7.6.4.1.1.1	In diffusion, ions or molecules can move down their concentration gradients in either direction across the cell membrane.
7.6.4.1.1.2	In contrast, active transport is directional, and moves a substance either into or out of the cell or organelle, depending on need.
7.6.4.1.1.3	There are three kinds of membrane proteins that carry out active transport (Figure 6.13): Figure 6.13 Three Types of Proteins for Active Transport
7.6.4.1.2.1	A uniporter moves a single substance in one direction.
7.6.4.1.2.2	For example, a calcium-binding protein found in the cell membrane and the ER membranes of many cells actively transports Ca2+ to locations where it is more highly concentrated, either outside the cell or inside the lumen of the ER.
7.6.4.1.3.1	A symporter moves two substances in the same direction.
7.6.4.1.3.2	For example, a symporter in the cells that line the intestine must bind Na+ in addition to an amino acid in order to absorb amino acids from the intestine.
7.6.4.1.4.1	An antiporter moves two substances in opposite directions, one into the cell (or organelle) and the other out of the cell (or organelle).
7.6.4.1.4.2	For example, many cells have a sodium   potassium pump that moves Na+ out of the cell and K+ into it.
7.6.4.1.5.1	Symporters and antiporters are also known as coupled transporters because they move two substances at once.
7.6.4.2.1.1	There are two basic types of active transport:
7.6.4.2.2.1	Primary active transport involves the direct hydrolysis of ATP, which provides the energy required for transport.
7.6.4.2.3.1	Secondary active transport does not use ATP directly.
7.6.4.2.3.2	Instead, its energy is supplied by an ion concentration gradient established by primary (ATP-driven) active transport.
7.6.4.2.4.1	In primary active transport, energy released by the hydrolysis of ATP drives the movement of specific ions against their concentration gradients.
7.6.4.2.4.2	For example, we mentioned earlier that concentrations of potassium ions (K+) inside a cell are often much higher than in the fluid bathing the cell.
7.6.4.2.4.3	However, the concentration of sodium ions (Na+) is often much higher outside the cell.
7.6.4.2.4.4	A protein in the cell membrane pumps Na+ out of the cell and K+ into the cell against these concentration gradients, ensuring that the gradients are maintained (Figure 6.14).
7.6.4.2.4.5	This sodium   potassium (Na+   K+) pump is found in all animal cells.
7.6.4.2.4.6	The pump is an integral membrane glycoprotein.
7.6.4.2.4.7	It breaks down a molecule of ATP to ADP and a free phosphate ion (Pi) and uses the energy released to bring two K+ ions into the cell and export three Na+ ions.
7.6.4.2.4.8	The Na+   K+ pump is thus an antiporter because it moves two substances in different directions.
7.6.4.2.4.9	Figure 6.14 Primary Active Transport: The Sodium   Potassium Pump
7.6.4.2.5.1	In active transport, energy is used to move a solute against its concentration gradient.
7.6.4.2.5.2	Here, energy from ATP is used to move Na+ and K+ against their concentration gradients.
7.6.4.2.6.1	An important drug used to treat a weak heart inhibits the Na+   K+ pump.
7.6.4.2.6.2	Digitalis, purified from the foxglove plant, blocks the release of phosphate ions (Pi) from the protein (see Figure 6.14, step 4).
7.6.4.2.6.3	This    freezes  ? the shape of the pump, and it can no longer bind Na+.
7.6.4.2.6.4	So Na+ accumulates inside heart cells.
7.6.4.2.6.5	This ultimately leads to a greater force of contraction of heart muscle, which aids a patient whose heart is not pumping well.
7.6.4.2.7.1	In secondary active transport, the movement of a substance against its concentration gradient is accomplished using energy    regained  ? by letting ions move across the membrane with their concentration gradients.
7.6.4.2.7.2	Think of it this way: A large dam may prevent a river from flowing.
7.6.4.2.7.3	The accumulated water represents energy, and when the water is allowed to flow past the dam, the energy it releases can be used to drive turbines that make electricity.
7.6.4.2.7.4	It   s similar for secondary active transport.
7.6.4.2.7.5	Consider, for example, the absorption of glucose into the bloodstream from the digestive tract.
7.6.4.2.7.6	Once the Na+   K+ pump establishes a concentration gradient of sodium ions, the passive diffusion of some Na+ back into the cell can provide energy for the secondary active transport of glucose into the cell (Figure 6.15).
7.6.4.2.7.7	Secondary active transport aids in the uptake of amino acids and sugars, which are essential raw materials for cell maintenance and growth.
7.6.4.2.7.8	Both types of coupled transport proteins   symporters and antiporters   are used for secondary active transport.
7.6.4.2.8.1	Figure 6.15 Secondary Active Transport
7.6.4.2.9.1	The Na+ concentration gradient established by primary active transport by the sodium-potassium pump (left) powers the secondary active transport of glucose (right).
7.6.4.2.9.2	A symporter protein couples the movement of glucose across the membrane against its concentration gradient to the passive movement of Na+ into the cell.
7.6.4.2.10.1	Q: If the Na+-K+ pump is blocked by a drug, how will intercellular concentrations of Na+ and glucose be affected?
7.6.4.2.11.1	6.4 recap
7.6.4.2.12.1	Active transport across a membrane is directional and requires an input of energy to move substances against their concentration gradients.
7.6.4.2.12.2	Active transport allows a cell to maintain small molecules and ions at concentrations very different from those in the surrounding environment.

7.6.4.2.21.1	What are the differences between primary active transport and secondary active transport?
7.6.4.2.22.1	What are the similarities and differences between active transport and facilitated diffusion?
7.6.4.2.23.1	We have examined a number of passive and active ways in which ions and small molecules can enter and leave cells.
7.6.4.2.23.2	But what about large molecules such as proteins?
7.6.4.2.23.3	Many proteins are so large that they diffuse very slowly, and their bulk makes it difficult for them to pass through the phospholipid bilayer.
7.6.4.2.23.4	A completely different mechanism is needed to move intact large molecules across membranes.
7.6.4.2.24.1	Chapter 6 continues with
7.6.4.2.25.1	6.5  Large Molecules Enter and Leave a Cell through Vesicles
7.6.5.1.1	Macromolecules and particles enter the cell by endocytosis
7.6.5.2.1	Receptor-mediated endocytosis is highly specific
7.6.5.3.1	Exocytosis moves materials out of the cell
7.6.5.4.1	Macromolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids are simply too large and too charged or polar to pass through biological membranes.
7.6.5.4.2	This is actually fortunate   think of the consequences if such molecules diffused out of cells: A red blood cell would not retain its hemoglobin!
7.6.5.4.3	As you saw in Chapter 5, the development of a selectively permeable membrane was essential for the functioning of the first cells when life on Earth began.
7.6.5.4.4	The interior of a cell can be maintained as a separate compartment with a different composition from that of the exterior environment, which is subject to abrupt changes.
7.6.5.4.5	However, cells must sometimes take up or secrete (release to the external environment) intact large molecules.
7.6.5.4.6	In Key Concept 5.3 we described phagocytosis, the mechanism by which solid particles can be brought into the cell by means of vesicles that pinch off from the cell membrane.
7.6.5.4.7	The general terms for the mechanisms by which substances enter and leave the cell via membrane vesicles are endocytosis and exocytosis.
7.6.5.5.1	focus your learning
7.6.5.6.1	Three types of endocytosis occur in cells.
7.6.5.7.1	Cells take in specific molecules from the environment through receptor-mediated endocytosis.
7.6.5.8.1	Exocytosis is the process by which substances are secreted by a cell.
7.6.5.1.1.1	Endocytosis is a general term for a group of processes that bring small molecules, macromolecules, large particles, and even small cells into the eukaryotic cell (Figure 6.16A).
7.6.5.1.1.2	We described an example of endocytosis earlier in the chapter, involving integrins (see Figure 6.8).
7.6.5.1.1.3	Generally, there are three types of endocytosis: phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis.
7.6.5.1.1.4	In all three, the cell membrane invaginates (folds inward), forming a small pocket around materials from the environment.
7.6.5.1.1.5	The pocket deepens, forming a vesicle.
7.6.5.1.1.6	This vesicle separates from the cell membrane and migrates with its contents to the cell   s interior.
7.6.5.1.2.1	Figure 6.16 Endocytosis and Exocytosis
7.6.5.1.3.1	Endocytosis (A) and exocytosis (B) are used by eukaryotic cells to take up and release fluids, large molecules, and particles.
7.6.5.1.3.2	Smaller cells, such as invading bacteria, can be taken up by endocytosis.
7.6.5.1.4.1	In phagocytosis (   cellular eating  ?), part of the cell membrane engulfs large particles or even entire cells.
7.6.5.1.4.2	Unicellular protists use phagocytosis for feeding, and some white blood cells use phagocytosis to defend the body by engulfing foreign cells and substances.
7.6.5.1.4.3	The food vacuole or phagosome that forms usually fuses with a lysosome, where its contents are digested (see Figure 5.10).
7.6.5.1.5.1	In pinocytosis (   cellular drinking  ?), vesicles also form.
7.6.5.1.5.2	However, these vesicles are smaller, and the process operates to bring fluids and dissolved substances into the cell.
7.6.5.1.5.3	Like phagocytosis, pinocytosis can be relatively nonspecific regarding what it brings into the cell.
7.6.5.1.5.4	For example, pinocytosis occurs constantly in the endothelium, the single layer of cells that separates a tiny blood capillary from the surrounding tissue.
7.6.5.1.5.5	Pinocytosis allows cells of the endothelium to rapidly acquire fluids and dissolved solutes from the blood.
7.6.5.1.6.1	In receptor-mediated endocytosis, molecules at the cell surface recognize and trigger the uptake of specific materials.
7.6.5.1.7.1	Let   s take a closer look at this last process.
7.6.5.2.1.1	Receptor-mediated endocytosis is used by animal cells to capture specific macromolecules from the cell   s environment.
7.6.5.2.1.2	This process depends on receptor proteins, which are proteins that can bind to specific molecules within the cell or in the cell   s external environment.
7.6.5.2.1.3	In receptor-mediated endocytosis, the receptors are integral membrane proteins located at particular regions on the extracellular surface of the cell membrane.
7.6.5.2.1.4	These membrane regions are called coated pits because they form slight depressions in the cell membrane and their cytoplasmic surfaces are coated by other proteins, such as clathrin.
7.6.5.2.1.5	The uptake process is similar to that in phagocytosis.
7.6.5.2.2.1	When a receptor protein binds to its specific ligand (in this case, the macromolecule to be taken into the cell), its coated pit invaginates and forms a coated vesicle around the bound macromolecule.
7.6.5.2.2.2	The clathrin molecules strengthen and stabilize the vesicle, which carries the macromolecule away from the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm (Figure 6.17).
7.6.5.2.2.3	Once inside, the vesicle loses its clathrin coat and may fuse with a lysosome, where the engulfed material is digested (by the hydrolysis of polymers to monomers) and the products are released into the cytoplasm.
7.6.5.2.2.4	Because of its specificity for particular macromolecules, receptor-mediated endocytosis is an efficient method of taking up substances that may exist at low concentrations in the cell   s environment.
7.6.5.2.2.5	Figure 6.17 Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis
7.6.5.2.3.1	The receptor proteins in a coated pit bind specific macromolecules, which are then carried into the cell by a coated vesicle.
7.6.5.2.4.1	Receptor-mediated endocytosis is the method by which cholesterol is taken up by most mammalian cells.
7.6.5.2.4.2	Water-insoluble cholesterol and triglycerides are packaged by liver cells into lipoprotein particles.
7.6.5.2.4.3	Most of the cholesterol is packaged into a type of lipoprotein particle called low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, which is circulated via the bloodstream.
7.6.5.2.4.4	When a particular cell requires cholesterol, it produces specific LDL receptors, which are inserted into the cell membrane in clathrin-coated pits.
7.6.5.2.4.5	Binding of LDLs to the receptor proteins triggers the uptake of the LDLs via receptor-mediated endocytosis.
7.6.5.2.4.6	Within the resulting vesicle, the LDL particles are freed from the receptors.
7.6.5.2.4.7	The receptors segregate to a region that buds off and forms a new vesicle, which is recycled to the cell membrane.
7.6.5.2.4.8	The freed LDL particles remain in the original vesicle, which fuses with a lysosome.
7.6.5.2.4.9	There, the LDLs are digested and the cholesterol made available for cell use.
7.6.5.2.5.1	In healthy individuals, the liver takes up unused LDLs for recycling.
7.6.5.2.5.2	People with the inherited disease familial hypercholesterolemia have a deficient LDL receptor in their livers.
7.6.5.2.5.3	This prevents receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDLs, resulting in dangerously high levels of cholesterol in the blood.
7.6.5.2.5.4	The cholesterol builds up in the arteries that nourish the heart and causes heart attacks.
7.6.5.2.5.5	In extreme cases where only the deficient receptor is present, children and teenagers can have severe cardiovascular disease.
7.6.5.3.1.1	Exocytosis is the process by which materials packaged in vesicles are secreted from a cell when the vesicle membrane fuses with the cell membrane (Figure 6.16B).
7.6.5.3.1.2	This fusing allows the vesicle contents to be released into the environment, and the vesicle membrane is smoothly incorporated into the cell membrane.
7.6.5.3.1.3	In another form of exocytosis, the vesicle touches the cell membrane and a pore forms, releasing the vesicle   s contents.
7.6.5.3.1.4	There is no membrane fusion in this process, termed    kiss and run.  ?
7.6.5.3.1.5	We saw an example of exocytosis in describing sweat glands at the start of the chapter.
7.6.5.3.2.1	Table 6.2 summarizes examples of endocytosis and exocytosis.

7.6.5.3.4.1	6.5 recap

7.6.5.3.8.1	Compare and contrast the three types of endocytosis.

7.6.5.3.15.1	What is the importance of aquaporin membrane channels?
7.6.5.3.16.1	There are a dozen genes encoding aquaporins in humans, each channel having its particular location in the body.
7.6.5.3.16.2	Genetic deficiency resulting in a lack of one of the aquaporins can have significant consequences.
7.6.5.3.16.3	For example, one of the aquaporins occurs in the part of the kidney where water is removed from the developing urine and returned to the blood.
7.6.5.3.16.4	When this aquaporin is absent, there is more water in urine and the person urinates more and more often; bedwetting is a common result.
7.6.5.3.16.5	In plants, aquaporins occur in the cell membrane and tonoplast (membrane that encloses the vacuole).
7.6.5.3.16.6	In the cell membranes of root cells, aquaporins form channels for water on its way from the soil to the interior tissues of the root, from which it is transported to the rest of the plant.
7.6.5.3.16.7	In the vacuole, aquaporin channels are important in the organelle swelling, resulting in turgor pressure, which is important in plant organ structure and plant cell expansion.
7.6.5.3.16.8	All of these aquaporins, and those of other organisms, share a common structure that spans the cell membrane and has a channel through which water molecules pass in single file.
7.6.5.3.17.1	Future directions
7.6.5.3.18.1	A fascinating role for aquaporins is not just in the transport of water across membranes, but in the accompanying transport of substances dissolved in it.
7.6.5.3.18.2	For example, in plants boron is an important nutrient, and it does not diffuse efficiently across membranes.
7.6.5.3.18.3	Soil water containing boron ions passes readily into plants through aquaporin channels.
7.6.5.3.18.4	Even gases such as CO2 may pass in and out of cells via aquaporins while dissolved in water.
7.6.5.3.18.5	Efforts are under way to insert aquaporins into synthetic membranes used for industrial applications.
7.6.5.3.18.6	Because aquaporins allow only water and low concentrations of ions to pass through, such membranes could be used to purify contaminated fresh water, or to desalinate water, which as you know has very high ion concentrations.
7.6.5.3.18.7	Aquaporins are expressed in skin, where they play a role in keeping the skin moist.
7.6.5.3.18.8	This is also a goal of some cosmetics (moisturizers) and has led to a search for, and patenting of, small molecules that stimulate aquaporins.
7.6.5.3.18.9	These molecules are components of some widely marketed skin creams.

7.6.summary.18.2	If the solution surrounding a cell is hypotonic to the cell interior, more water enters the cell than leaves it, causing it to swell.
7.6.summary.18.3	In plant cells, this contributes to turgor pressure.
7.6.summary.18.4	In a hypertonic solution, more water leaves the cell than enters it, causing it to shrivel.

7.6.summary.19.1	A substance can diffuse passively across a membrane by either simple diffusion or facilitated diffusion, via a channel protein or a carrier protein.

7.6.summary.38.2	Depending on where you go in the world, you can find fish at all extremes of body temperature.
7.6.summary.38.3	Desert pupfish native to desert springs in California and Mexico tolerate temperatures as high as 42&#x00B0;C.
7.6.summary.38.4	At the other extreme is the Arctic sculpin, which can tolerate water temperatures as low as &#x2212;2&#x00B0;C.

7.6.summary.39.1	A research group saw this range as an interesting opportunity to run a comparative study of the fluidity and composition of cell membranes.
7.6.summary.39.2	They included rats and hamsters in the study, because rats maintain a constant body temperature of 37&#x00B0;C and represent the high end of the temperature range.

7.7.9.1	A Signal for Bonding
7.7.10.1	Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) are small rodents that live in temperate climates, where they dig tunnels in fields.
7.7.10.2	When a male prairie vole encounters a female, the female enters her reproductive cycle and mating (which can take hours) often ensues.
7.7.10.3	After mating the pair stays together, building a nest and raising their pups.
7.7.10.4	The bond between the two voles is so strong that they stay together for life.
7.7.10.5	Contrast this behavior with that of the montane vole (M. montanus), which is closely related to the prairie vole and lives in the hills not far away.
7.7.10.6	In this species, mating is quick, and afterward the pair separates.
7.7.10.7	The male looks for new mates and the female abandons her young soon after they are born.
7.7.11.1	The reason for these dramatic behavioral differences lies in the brains of these two species.
7.7.11.2	When prairie voles mate, the brains of both males and females release specific peptides consisting of nine amino acids.
7.7.11.3	In females, the peptide is oxytocin; in males, it is vasopressin.
7.7.11.4	The peptides circulate in the bloodstream and reach all tissues in the body, but they bind to only a few cell types.
7.7.11.5	These cells have surface proteins called receptors, to which the peptides specifically bind, like a key inserting into a lock.
7.7.12.1	The binding of peptide to receptor causes the receptor, which extends across the cell membrane, to change shape.
7.7.12.2	Within the cytoplasm, this change sets off a series of events that ultimately result in changes in behavior.
7.7.12.3	The receptors for oxytocin and vasopressin in prairie voles are most concentrated in the regions of the brain that are responsible for behaviors such as bonding and caring for young.
7.7.12.4	In montane voles, there are far fewer receptors for these peptides, and as a result, fewer bonding and caring behaviors.
7.7.12.5	Clearly, oxytocin and vasopressin are signals that induce these behaviors.
7.7.13.1	Intercellular signaling is a hallmark of multicellular organisms.
7.7.13.2	A cell   s response to a signal molecule takes place in three sequential steps.
7.7.13.3	First, the signal binds to a receptor in the cell, often embedded in the outside surface of the cell membrane.
7.7.13.4	Second, signal binding conveys a message to the cell.
7.7.13.5	Third, the cell changes its activity in response to the signal.
7.7.13.6	In a multicellular organism, these steps lead to changes in that organism   s functioning, with signaling allowing different types of cells and tissues to work together.
7.7.14.1	Is oxytocin the &#8220;trust&#8221; signal in humans?
7.7.15.1	Chapter 7 continues with
7.7.16.1	7.1  Signals and Signaling Affect Cell Function
7.7.1.1.1	Cells receive several types of signals
7.7.1.2.1	A signal transduction pathway involves a signal, a receptor, and responses: Overview
7.7.1.3.1	Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells process information from their environments.
7.7.1.3.2	This information can be in the form of a physical stimulus, such as the light reaching your eyes as you read this book, or chemicals that bathe a cell, such as the carbohydrate lactose in the solution around bacteria.
7.7.1.3.3	A signal may come from outside the organism, such as the scent of a female moth seeking a mate in the dark, or from a neighboring cell within the organism, such as the liver, where signals from other organs cause liver cells to regulate their uptake or release of glucose.
7.7.1.4.1	focus your learning
7.7.1.5.1	Chemical signals that target cells can be classified according to signal source and mode of signal delivery.
7.7.1.6.1	A signal transduction pathway includes a signal, a receptor, and a response
7.7.1.7.1	Not all cells respond to a signal, because some lack the ability to receive the signal.
7.7.1.8.1	The presence of a signal does not always lead to a response; a cell does not respond to every signal, just as you are not paying close attention to every stimulus in your environment as you read this.
7.7.1.8.2	To respond to a signal, a cell must have a specific receptor that can detect it and a way to use that information to influence cellular processes.
7.7.1.8.3	A signal transduction pathway is a sequence of molecular events and chemical reactions that lead to a cell   s response to a signal.
7.7.1.8.4	Signal transduction pathways vary greatly in their details, but every such pathway involves a signal, a receptor, and a response.
7.7.1.8.5	This section will provide a brief overview of signal transduction.
7.7.1.8.6	We   ll consider receptors in Key Concept 7.2, and other aspects of signal transduction in Key Concepts 7.3 and 7.4.
7.7.0.0.1.1	Figure 7.1  Chemical Signaling Systems
7.7.0.0.2.1	The environment is full of signals.
7.7.0.0.2.2	For example, our sense organs allow us to respond to light (a physical signal), or odors and tastes (chemical signals).
7.7.0.0.2.3	Bacteria and protists can respond to small chemical changes in their surroundings.
7.7.0.0.2.4	Plants respond to light as a signal as well as an energy source, for example, by growing toward the source of light.
7.7.0.0.2.5	A cell that is deep inside a large multicellular organism and far away from the exterior environment receives signals from neighboring cells and the surrounding extracellular fluids.
7.7.0.0.2.6	In multicellular organisms, chemical signals are often made in one part of the body and arrive at target cells by local diffusion or by circulation in the blood or the plant vascular system.
7.7.0.0.2.7	Chemical cell signals are usually present in tiny concentrations (as low as 10   10 M) (see Chapter 2 for an explanation of molar concentrations) and differ in their sources and mode of delivery (Figure 7.1):
7.7.0.0.3.1	Autocrine signals diffuse to and affect the cells that make them.
7.7.0.0.3.2	For example, many tumor cells reproduce uncontrollably because they both make, and respond to, signals that stimulate cell division.
7.7.0.0.4.1	Juxtacrine signals affect only cells right next to and in contact with the cell producing the signal.
7.7.0.0.4.2	This type of signaling is especially common during development, when cells are in groups and changing to become specialized.
7.7.0.0.5.1	Paracrine signals diffuse to and affect nearby cells.
7.7.0.0.5.2	An example occurs in inflammation when the skin is cut.
7.7.0.0.5.3	Signals from skin cells are sent to nearby blood cells to aid in healing (see Key Concept 42. xx).
7.7.0.0.6.1	Signals that travel through the circulatory systems of animals or the vascular systems of plants are generally called hormones.
7.7.0.0.1.1	Figure 7.2 A Signal Transduction Pathway
7.7.0.0.2.1	As you saw in the opening story, the elements of a signal transduction pathway are a signal, a receptor, and a response (Figure 7.2).
7.7.0.0.2.2	For the information from a signal to be transmitted to a cell, the target cell must be able to receive the signal and respond to it.
7.7.0.0.2.3	This is the job of receptors.
7.7.0.0.2.4	All cells may be exposed to a chemical signal, but most cells in the organism may not be able to respond to it.
7.7.0.0.2.5	Only cells with the appropriate receptors can respond.
7.7.0.0.3.1	The response can involve enzymes, which catalyze biochemical reactions, and transcription factors, which are proteins that turn the expression of particular genes on and off.
7.7.0.0.3.2	An important feature of signal transduction is that the activities of specific enzymes and transcription factors are regulated: they are either activated or inactivated to bring about cellular changes (see Figure 7.2).
7.7.0.0.3.3	For example, an enzyme may be activated by the addition of a phosphate group (phosphorylation) to a particular site on the protein, thereby changing the enzyme   s shape (see Figure 3.13B) and exposing its active site.
7.7.0.0.3.4	The activity of a protein can also be regulated by mechanisms that control its location in the cell.
7.7.0.0.3.5	For example, a transcription factor located in the cytoplasm is inactive because it is separated from the genetic material in the nucleus; a signal transduction pathway may result in the transport of the factor to the nucleus, where it can affect gene expression.
7.7.0.0.4.1	In this chapter we   ll consider signal transduction pathways in isolation from one another.
7.7.0.0.4.2	In life, however, signal transduction pathways are often interconnected.
7.7.0.0.4.3	A great deal of crosstalk   interactions between different signal transduction pathways   is common.
7.7.0.0.4.4	For example, a single activated protein (receptor or enzyme) might activate enzymes or transcription factors in multiple pathways, leading to multiple responses to a single stimulus.
7.7.0.0.4.5	Multiple signal transduction pathways might converge on a single transcription factor, allowing the transcription of a single gene to be adjusted in response to several different signals.
7.7.0.0.4.6	Crosstalk can also result in the activation of one pathway and the inhibition of another.
7.7.0.0.4.7	The phenomenon of crosstalk inside the cell is analogous to the    crosstalk  ? that occurs at the level of the whole body.
7.7.0.0.4.8	For example, in your limbs you have opposing muscles.
7.7.0.0.4.9	When you bend your elbow, you contract one set of muscles and relax the opposing muscles, so that your arm will bend.
7.7.0.0.4.10	Because of crosstalk, biologists often refer to    signaling networks  ? rather than signal transduction pathways, reflecting the high degree of complexity in cellular signaling.
7.7.0.0.5.1	7.1 recap
7.7.0.0.6.1	Cells are constantly exposed to molecular signals that can come from the external environment or from within the body of a multicellular organism.
7.7.0.0.6.2	To respond to a signal, the cell must have a specific receptor that detects the signal and activates some type of cellular response.
7.7.0.0.6.3	Signal transduction pathways involve regulation of enzymes and transcription factors, and crosstalk often occurs between pathways.
7.7.0.0.7.1	learning outcomes

7.7.0.0.15.2	What makes signaling specific?
7.7.0.0.16.1	The general features of signal transduction pathways described in this section will recur in more detail throughout the chapter.
7.7.0.0.16.2	First, let   s consider more closely the nature of the receptors that bind signal molecules.

7.7.0.0.18.1	7.2  Receptors Bind Signals to Initiate a Cellular Response
7.7.2.1.1	Receptors that recognize chemical signals have specific binding sites
7.7.2.2.1	Receptors can be classified by location and function
7.7.2.3.1	Ion channels
7.7.2.4.1	Protein kinase receptors
7.7.2.5.1	G Protein-linked receptors
7.7.2.6.1	Intracellular receptors are located in the cytoplasm or the nucleus
7.7.2.7.1	Intracellular receptors
7.7.2.8.1	Any given cell in a multicellular organism is bombarded with many signals.
7.7.2.8.2	However, it responds to only some of them, because no cell makes receptors for all signals.
7.7.2.8.3	A receptor protein recognizes its signal very specifically, in much the same way that a membrane transport protein recognizes and binds to the substance it transports.
7.7.2.8.4	This specificity ensures that only those cells that make a specific receptor will respond to a given signal.
7.7.2.9.1	focus your learning
7.7.2.10.1	Cells make specific receptor proteins that recognize only the signals to which they respond.
7.7.2.11.1	The binding of a chemical signal (called a ligand) with its receptor is reversible and is measured by a dissociation constant.
7.7.2.12.1	Intracellular receptors are located inside the cell, where they interact with physical signals such as light or with chemical signals that diffuse across the cell membrane.
7.7.0.0.1.1	Figure 7.3 A Signal and Its Receptor
7.7.0.0.2.1	Q: Is the binding of adenosine and caffeine covalent or noncovalent?
7.7.0.0.2.2	Explain your answer.
7.7.0.0.3.1	A ligand is a specific chemical signal molecule that fits into a three-dimensional site on its protein receptor (Figure 7.3A).
7.7.0.0.3.2	Binding of the signaling ligand causes the receptor protein to change its three-dimensional shape, and that conformational change initiates a cellular response.
7.7.0.0.3.3	The ligand does not contribute further to this response.
7.7.0.0.3.4	In fact, the ligand is usually not changed; its role is purely to    knock on the door.  ?
7.7.0.0.4.1	The sensitivity of a cell to a signal is determined in part by the affinity of the cell   s receptors for the signal ligand   the likelihood that the receptor will bind to the ligand at any given ligand concentration.
7.7.0.0.4.2	Receptors (R) bind to their ligands (L) according to chemistry   s law of mass action.
7.7.0.0.4.3	This means that the binding is reversible:
7.7.0.0.5.1	For most ligand   receptor complexes (RL), binding is favored.
7.7.0.0.5.2	Reversibility is important, however, because if the ligand were never released, the receptor would be continuously stimulated and the cell would never stop responding.
7.7.0.0.6.1	As with any reversible chemical reaction, the binding and dissociation processes each have a rate constant, here designated k1 and k2:
7.7.0.0.7.1	A rate constant relates the rate of a reaction to the concentration(s) of the reactant(s):
7.7.0.0.8.1	where    [ ]  ? indicates the concentration of the substance inside the brackets.
7.7.0.0.8.2	Binding of a receptor to a ligand is reversible, and when equilibrium is reached the rate of binding equals the rate of dissociation:
7.7.0.0.9.1	If this is rearranged, we get:
7.7.0.0.10.1	kD, the dissociation constant, is a measure of the affinity of the receptor for its ligand.
7.7.0.0.10.2	The lower the kD, the higher the affinity of the ligand for its receptor.
7.7.0.0.10.3	Some receptors have very low kD values, which allows them to bind their ligands at very low ligand concentrations; other receptors have higher kD values and need more ligand to be present to set off their signal transduction pathways.
7.7.0.0.11.1	An entire field of biology and medicine   called pharmacology   is devoted to the study of drugs.
7.7.0.0.11.2	These molecules are usually thought of as synthetic, but some are natural substances, such as caffeine (see Figure 7.3B).
7.7.0.0.11.3	Drugs function as ligands that bind specific receptors.
7.7.0.0.11.4	In the discovery and design of new drugs, it is helpful to know the specific receptor that the drug will bind, because then it is possible to determine the kD value of its binding.
7.7.0.0.11.5	This is one factor that can be taken into consideration when determining dosage levels.
7.7.0.0.11.6	Of course, many drugs have side effects, and these are also dosage-dependent.
7.7.0.0.12.1	What happens when a ligand binds to a receptor?
7.7.0.0.12.2	When we discussed small molecules binding to proteins in Key Concept 3.2, we described how proteins often change shape when bound.
7.7.0.0.12.3	This is exactly what happens to receptors.
7.7.0.0.12.4	The change in the receptor   s shape may expose a previously hidden group of amino acids on the protein that participate in a biochemical activity.
7.7.0.0.12.5	This activity may be the binding of another molecule, such as another protein (e. g. , a G protein, discussed below), or a substrate for an enzyme.
7.7.0.0.13.1	Instead of the ligand, other chemicals that resemble it can bind to the receptor.
7.7.0.0.13.2	Agonists are chemicals that set a receptor into signal transduction mode just as the ligand does.
7.7.0.0.13.3	In contrast, inhibitors, or antagonists, bind to the receptor and    freeze  ? it in place, preventing the real ligand from binding, but do not set off signal transduction.
7.7.0.0.13.4	Agonists and antagonists can be natural, or we can make them in the lab once we know the details of receptor   ligand binding.
7.7.0.0.14.1	Many substances that alter human behavior bind to specific receptors in the brain and prevent the binding of the receptors    specific ligands.
7.7.0.0.14.2	One example is caffeine, which is probably the world   s most widely consumed stimulant.
7.7.0.0.14.3	In the brain, the nucleoside adenosine acts as a ligand that binds to a receptor on nerve cells, initiating a signal transduction pathway that reduces brain activity, especially feelings of active wakefulness.
7.7.0.0.14.4	Because caffeine has a molecular structure similar to that of adenosine, it also binds to the adenosine receptor (Figure 7.3B).
7.7.0.0.14.5	But in this case binding does not initiate a signal transduction pathway.
7.7.0.0.14.6	Rather, it    ties up  ? the receptor, preventing adenosine binding and thereby allowing continued nerve cell activity and an active feeling.
7.7.0.0.1.1	Figure 7.4 Two Locations for Receptors
7.7.0.0.2.1	There are many kinds of chemical signals.
7.7.0.0.2.2	Some ligands are hydrophobic (nonpolar) and can diffuse through membranes, whereas others cannot.
7.7.0.0.2.3	Physical signals such as light also vary in their ability to penetrate cells and tissues.
7.7.0.0.2.4	Correspondingly, a receptor can be classified by its location in the cell, which largely depends on the nature of its signal (Figure 7.4):
7.7.0.0.3.1	Membrane receptors: Large or polar ligands cannot cross the lipid bilayer.
7.7.0.0.3.2	Insulin, for example, is a protein hormone that cannot diffuse through the cell membrane; instead, it binds to a transmembrane receptor with an extracellular binding domain.
7.7.0.0.4.1	Intracellular receptors: Small or nonpolar ligands can diffuse across the nonpolar phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane and enter the cell.
7.7.0.0.4.2	The hormone estrogen, for example, is a lipid-soluble steroid (see in-text art p. 61) that can diffuse across the cell membrane; it binds to a receptor inside the cell.
7.7.0.0.4.3	Light of certain wavelengths can penetrate the cells in a plant leaf quite easily, and many types of light receptors in plants are also intracellular.
7.7.0.0.5.1	In complex eukaryotes such as mammals and higher plants, there are three well-studied categories of cell membrane receptors that are grouped according to their functions: ion channels, protein kinase receptors, and G protein-linked receptors.
7.7.0.0.1.1	As you saw in Key Concept 6.3, the cell membranes of many types of cells have gated ion channels that allow ions such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, or Cl    to enter or leave the cell.
7.7.0.0.1.2	The gate-opening mechanism is an alteration in the three-dimensional shape of the channel protein upon interaction with a signal; thus these proteins function as *receptors.
7.7.0.0.1.3	Each type of ion channel responds to a specific signal, including sensory stimuli such as light, sound, and electric charge differences across the cell membrane, as well as chemical ligands such as hormones and neurotransmitters.
7.7.0.0.2.1	*connect the concepts Ion channels are key to the functioning of the nervous system.
7.7.0.0.2.2	An example is the connection between nerve and muscle described in Key Concepts 45.3 and 48.1.
7.7.0.0.2.3	Figure 7.5 A Gated Ion Channel
7.7.0.0.3.1	The acetylcholine receptor, located in the cell membrane of skeletal muscle cells, is an example of an ion channel.
7.7.0.0.3.2	This protein is a sodium channel that binds the ligand acetylcholine, which is a neurotransmitter   a chemical signal released from nerve cells (Figure 7.5).
7.7.0.0.3.3	When two molecules of acetylcholine bind to the channel, it opens for about a thousandth of a second.
7.7.0.0.3.4	That is enough time for Na+, which is more concentrated outside the cell than inside, to rush into the cell, moving in response to both concentration and electric potential gradients.
7.7.0.0.3.5	The change in Na+ concentration in the cell initiates a series of events that result in muscle contraction.
7.7.0.0.1.1	Some eukaryotic receptor proteins, called protein kinases, catalyze the phosphorylation (adding phosphate) of themselves or other proteins, thus changing their shapes and therefore their functions.
7.7.0.0.2.1	Phosphorylation is a reaction that is especially important in biology.
7.7.0.0.2.2	Of the estimated 21,000 genes that code for proteins in humans, more than 500 of them encode protein kinases.
7.7.0.0.2.3	When you think of all the functions that make up a person, this is indeed an impressive number.
7.7.0.0.2.4	The three amino acids that are phosphorylated are therefore worth knowing: Figure 7.6 A Protein Kinase Receptor
7.7.0.0.3.1	The receptor for insulin is an example of a protein kinase receptor.
7.7.0.0.3.2	Insulin is a protein hormone made by the pancreas.
7.7.0.0.3.3	Its receptor has two copies each of two different polypeptide subunits called    and    (Figure 7.6).
7.7.0.0.3.4	When insulin binds to the receptor, the receptor becomes activated and is able to phosphorylate itself and certain cytoplasmic proteins that are appropriately called insulin-response substrates.
7.7.0.0.3.5	These proteins then initiate many cellular responses, including the insertion of glucose transporters (see Figure 6.12) into the cell membrane.
7.7.0.0.1.1	A third category of eukaryotic cell membrane receptors is the G protein-linked receptors, also referred to by the more impressive sounding name seven-transmembrane domain receptors.
7.7.0.0.1.2	These receptors have many roles, including light detection in the mammalian retina (photoreceptors), detection of odors (olfactory receptors), and regulation of mood and behavior (such as mating in mammals and even single-celled yeasts).
7.7.0.0.1.3	The receptors that bind the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin, which affect mating behavior in voles (see the opening story), are G protein-linked receptors.
7.7.0.0.2.1	The seven-transmembrane domains of the receptor protein pass through the phospholipid bilayer and are separated by short loops that extend either outside or inside the cell.
7.7.0.0.2.2	Ligand binding on the extracellular side of the receptor changes the shape of its cytoplasmic region, exposing a site that binds to a mobile membrane protein called a G protein.
7.7.0.0.2.3	The G protein is partially inserted into the lipid bilayer and partially exposed on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane.
7.7.0.0.3.1	Many G proteins have three polypeptide subunits and can bind three different types of molecules (Figure 7.7A):
7.7.0.0.4.1	Figure 7.7 A G Protein-Linked Receptor
7.7.0.0.5.1	The G protein is an intermediary between the receptor and its effector.
7.7.0.0.6.1	The receptor
7.7.0.0.7.1	GDP and GTP (guanosine diphosphate and triphosphate, respectively; these are nucleoside phosphates like ADP and ATP)
7.7.0.0.8.1	An effector protein (see next paragraph)
7.7.0.0.9.1	When the G protein binds to an activated receptor protein, GDP is exchanged for GTP (Figure 7.7B).
7.7.0.0.9.2	At the same time, the ligand is usually released from the extracellular side of the receptor.
7.7.0.0.9.3	GTP binding causes a conformational change in the G protein.
7.7.0.0.9.4	The GTP-bound subunit then separates from the rest of the G protein, diffusing in the plane of the phospholipid bilayer until it encounters an effector protein to which it can bind.
7.7.0.0.9.5	An effector protein is just what its name implies: it causes an effect in the cell.
7.7.0.0.9.6	The binding of the GTP-bearing G protein subunit activates the effector   which may be an enzyme or an ion channel   thereby causing changes in cell function (Figure 7.7C).
7.7.0.0.10.1	After activation of the effector protein, the GTP bound to the G protein is hydrolyzed to GDP.
7.7.0.0.10.2	The now inactive G protein subunit separates from the effector protein and diffuses in the membrane to collide with and bind to the other two G protein subunits.
7.7.0.0.10.3	When the three components of the G protein are reassembled, the protein is capable of binding again to an activated receptor.
7.7.0.0.10.4	After binding, the activated receptor exchanges the GDP on the G protein for a GTP, and the cycle begins again.
7.7.0.0.1.1	Figure 7.8 An Intracellular Receptor
7.7.0.0.2.1	are located inside the cell and respond to physical signals such as light (e. g. , some photoreceptors in plants) or chemical signals that can diffuse across the cell membrane (e. g. , steroid hormones in animals).
7.7.0.0.2.2	Many intracellular receptors are transcription factors.
7.7.0.0.2.3	Some are located in the cytoplasm until they are activated; after binding their ligands, these transcription factors move to the nucleus where they bind to DNA and alter the expression of specific genes.
7.7.0.0.2.4	A typical example is the receptor for the steroid hormone cortisol.
7.7.0.0.2.5	This receptor is normally bound to a chaperone protein that blocks it from entering the nucleus.
7.7.0.0.2.6	Binding of the hormone causes the receptor to change its shape so that the chaperone is released (Figure 7.8).
7.7.0.0.2.7	This release allows the receptor to enter the nucleus, where it affects DNA transcription.
7.7.0.0.2.8	Another group of intracellular receptors is always located in the nucleus, and their ligands must enter the nucleus before binding.
7.7.0.0.3.1	7.2 recap
7.7.0.0.4.1	Receptors are proteins that bind, or are changed by, specific ligands or physical signals.
7.7.0.0.4.2	The changed receptor initiates a response in the cell.
7.7.0.0.4.3	These receptors are located in the cell membrane or inside the cell.
7.7.0.0.5.1	learning outcomes
7.7.0.0.6.1	You should be able to:
7.7.0.0.7.1	Explain how and why different cells respond to different chemical signals.
7.7.0.0.8.1	Using equations, describe the chemical kinetics of receptor   ligand interactions.
7.7.0.0.9.1	Analyze dissociation constants as a measure of binding affinity.
7.7.0.0.10.1	Compare and contrast cell membrane receptors and intracellular receptors.
7.7.0.0.11.1	What is the dissociation constant kD, and what does it tell us about the likelihood that a signal will produce a cellular response?
7.7.0.0.12.1	What is the chemical nature and importance of specificity in the binding of a receptor to its particular ligand?
7.7.0.0.13.1	What are the differences between receptors located in the cytoplasm and those at the cell membrane?
7.7.0.0.14.1	Now that we have discussed signals and receptors, let   s examine the characteristics of the molecules (transducers) that mediate the cellular response.
7.7.0.0.15.1	Chapter 7 continues with
7.7.0.0.16.1	7.3  The Response to a Signal Spreads through the Cell
7.7.3.1.1	The cell amplifies its response to ligand binding
7.7.3.2.1	Second messengers can amplify signals between receptors and target molecules
7.7.3.3.1	Lipid-derived second messengers
7.7.3.4.1	Calcium ions
7.7.3.5.1	Nitric oxide
7.7.3.6.1	Signal transduction is highly regulated
7.7.3.7.1	As you have seen, there are different kinds of signals and receptors.
7.7.3.7.2	Not surprisingly, the ways that signals are transduced, and the resulting cellular responses, also vary.
7.7.3.7.3	Some signal transduction pathways are quite simple and direct, whereas others involve multiple steps.
7.7.3.7.4	As we mentioned in Key Concept 7.1, signal transduction pathways can involve enzymes and transcription factors.
7.7.3.7.5	In addition, second messengers can diffuse throughout the cytoplasm and mediate further steps in pathways.
7.7.3.8.1	focus your learning
7.7.3.9.1	A signal transduction cascade transmits and amplifies a signal inside a cell.
7.7.3.10.1	Second   messenger molecules can transmit and amplify signals within a cell.
7.7.3.11.1	Signal transduction is regulated in a cell by various mechanisms.
7.7.3.12.1	In many cases, a signal can initiate a cascade (chain) of events, in which proteins interact with other proteins, which interact with still other proteins until the final responses are achieved.
7.7.3.12.2	Through such a cascade, an initial signal can be both amplified and distributed to cause several different responses in the target cell.
7.7.3.12.3	In this section we will examine the kinds of molecules that transduce signals and look at several different signal transduction pathways.
7.7.0.0.1.1	Figure 7.9 Signal Transduction and Cancer
7.7.0.0.2.1	Scientists worked out the signal transduction pathway for one growth factor by studying a cell that went wrong.
7.7.0.0.2.2	Many human bladder cancers contain an abnormal form of a protein called ras (so named because a similar protein was previously isolated from a rat sarcoma tumor).
7.7.0.0.2.3	Investigations of these bladder cancers showed that ras was a G protein.
7.7.0.0.2.4	Recall that G proteins function as switches with    on  ? and    off  ? states.
7.7.0.0.2.5	In the    off  ? state, G protein is bound to GDP, whereas in the    on  ? state the protein becomes bound to GTP.
7.7.0.0.2.6	The abnormal form of the ras protein under study was always active because it was permanently bound to GTP and thus caused continuous cell division (Figure 7.9).
7.7.0.0.3.1	Other cancer cells have abnormalities in different parts of the same signal transduction pathway.
7.7.0.0.3.2	By comparing the defects in abnormal cells with the normal signaling process in non-cancer cells, biologists worked out the entire signaling pathway (Focus: Key Figure 7.10).
7.7.0.0.3.3	Recall from Key Concept 7.2 that G protein mediates a response after activation by the protein kinase receptor.
7.7.0.0.3.4	In Figure 7.10, the activated G protein ras initiates a series of additional events comprising a signal transduction pathway known as a protein kinase cascade, where one protein kinase activates the next, and so on.
7.7.0.0.3.5	Such cascades are key to the regulation of many cellular activities.
7.7.0.0.3.6	Protein kinase cascades are useful signal transducers for four reasons:
7.7.0.0.4.1	focus: key figure
7.7.0.0.5.1	Figure 7.10 A Protein Kinase Cascade
7.7.0.0.6.1	In a protein kinase cascade, a series of proteins are sequentially activated.
7.7.0.0.7.1	Q: Sorafenib is a drug that was designed to inhibit raf, which is very active in kidney cancer.
7.7.0.0.7.2	How does this drug work on the protein kinase cascade?
7.7.0.0.8.1	At each step in the cascade of events, the signal is amplified, because each newly activated protein kinase is an enzyme that can catalyze the phosphorylation of many target proteins (see Figure 7.10, steps 5 and 6).
7.7.0.0.9.1	The information from a signal that originally arrived at the cell membrane is communicated to the nucleus, where the expression of multiple genes is often modified.
7.7.0.0.10.1	The multitude of steps provides some specificity to the process.
7.7.0.0.11.1	Different target proteins at each step in the cascade can provide variation in the response.
7.7.0.0.1.1	Often there is a small molecule intermediary between the activated receptor and the cascade of events that ensues.
7.7.0.0.1.2	Earl Sutherland and his colleagues at Case Western Reserve University discovered one such molecule when they were investigating the activation of the liver enzyme glycogen phosphorylase by the hormone epinephrine.
7.7.0.0.1.3	The hormone is released when an animal faces life-threatening conditions and needs energy fast for the fight-or-flight response (see Figure 40.3).
7.7.0.0.1.4	Glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes the breakdown of glycogen stored in the liver so that the resulting glucose molecules can be released to the blood.
7.7.0.0.1.5	The enzyme is present in the liver cell cytoplasm but is inactive unless the liver cells are exposed to epinephrine: Figure 7.11 The Formation of Cyclic AMP
7.7.0.0.2.1	The researchers found that epinephrine could activate glycogen phosphorylase in liver cells that had been broken open, but only if the entire cell contents, including cell membrane fragments, were present.
7.7.0.0.2.2	Under these conditions epinephrine was bound to the cell membrane fragments (the location of its receptor), but the active phosphorylase was present in the solution.
7.7.0.0.2.3	Adding epinephrine to just cytoplasm with inactive phosphorylase did not result in activation.
7.7.0.0.2.4	The researchers hypothesized that there must be a    second messenger  ? that transmits the epinephrine signal (epinephrine being the    first messenger  ?).
7.7.0.0.2.5	The experiments confirmed the existence of a second messenger, later identified as cyclic AMP (cAMP), which is produced from ATP by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase (Figure 7.11).
7.7.0.0.2.6	Adenylyl cyclase is activated via a G protein-linked epinephrine receptor (see the first steps in Figure 7.15).
7.7.0.0.3.1	In contrast to the specificity of receptor binding, second messengers such as cAMP allow a cell to respond to a single event at the cell membrane with many events inside the cell.
7.7.0.0.3.2	Thus second messengers serve to rapidly amplify and distribute the signal   for example, binding of a single epinephrine molecule leads to the production of many molecules of cAMP, which then activate many enzyme targets by binding to them noncovalently.
7.7.0.0.3.3	In the case of epinephrine and the liver cell, glycogen phosphorylase is just one of several enzymes that are activated.
7.7.0.0.4.1	Second messengers are often involved in crosstalk between different signaling pathways.
7.7.0.0.4.2	Activation of the epinephrine receptor is not the only way for a cell to produce cAMP; and as noted, there are multiple targets of cAMP in the cell, and these targets are parts of other pathways.
7.7.0.0.5.1	Several other classes of second messengers have since been identified, including lipid-derived second messengers, calcium ions, and nitric oxide.
7.7.0.0.1.1	In addition to their role as structural components of the cell membrane, phospholipids are also involved in signal transduction.
7.7.0.0.1.2	When certain phospholipids are hydrolyzed into their component parts by enzymes called phospholipases, second messengers are formed.
7.7.0.0.2.1	The best-studied examples of lipid-derived second messengers come from hydrolysis of the phospholipid phosphatidyl inositol-bisphosphate (PIP2).
7.7.0.0.2.2	Like all phospholipids, PIP2 has a hydrophobic portion embedded in the cell membrane: two fatty acid tails attached to a molecule of glycerol, which together form diacylglycerol, or DAG.
7.7.0.0.2.3	The hydrophilic portion of PIP2 is inositol trisphosphate, or IP3, which projects into the cytoplasm.
7.7.0.0.3.1	As with cAMP, the receptors involved in this second-messenger system are often G protein-linked receptors.
7.7.0.0.3.2	A G protein subunit is activated by the receptor, then diffuses within the cell membrane and activates phospholipase C, an enzyme that is also located in the membrane.
7.7.0.0.3.3	This enzyme cleaves off the IP3 from PIP2, leaving the diacylglycerol (DAG) in the phospholipid bilayer:
7.7.0.0.4.1	IP3 and DAG are both second messengers; they have different modes of action that build on each other to activate protein kinase C (PKC).
7.7.0.0.4.2	PKC refers to a family of protein kinases that can phosphorylate a wide variety of target proteins, leading to a multiplicity of cellular responses that vary depending on the tissue or cell type.
7.7.0.0.1.1	Calcium ions (Ca2+) are scarce inside most cells, which have cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations of only about 0.1 micromolar (  M).
7.7.0.0.1.2	Ca2+ concentrations outside cells and within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are usually much higher.
7.7.0.0.1.3	Active transport proteins in the cell and ER membranes maintain this concentration difference by pumping Ca2+ out of the cytosol.
7.7.0.0.1.4	In contrast to cAMP and the lipid-derived second messengers, Ca2+ cannot be synthesized to increase the intracellular Ca2+ concentration.
7.7.0.0.1.5	Instead, Ca2+ ion levels are regulated via the opening and closing of ion channels and the action of membrane pumps.
7.7.0.0.1.6	Figure 7.12 Calcium Ions as Second Messengers
7.7.0.0.2.1	Many signals can cause calcium channels to open, including IP3.
7.7.0.0.2.2	The entry of a sperm into an egg is a very important signal that causes a massive opening of calcium channels, resulting in numerous and dramatic changes that prepare the now-fertilized egg for cell division and development (Figure 7.12).
7.7.0.0.2.3	Whatever the initial signal that causes calcium channels to open, their opening results in a dramatic increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, which can increase up to 100-fold within a fraction of a second.
7.7.0.0.2.4	This increase activates PKC.
7.7.0.0.2.5	In addition, Ca2+ controls other ion channels and stimulates secretion by exocytosis in many cell types.
7.7.0.0.1.1	Figure 7.13 Nitric Oxide in Signal Transduction
7.7.0.0.2.1	Most signaling molecules and second messengers are solutes that remain dissolved in either the aqueous or hydrophobic components of cells.
7.7.0.0.2.2	It was a great surprise to find that a gas could also be active in signal transduction.
7.7.0.0.2.3	Nitric oxide (NO) is a second messenger in the signal transduction pathway between the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (see Key Concept 7.2) and the relaxation of smooth muscles lining blood vessels, which allows more blood flow (Figure 7.13).
7.7.0.0.2.4	In the body, NO is made from the amino acid arginine by the enzyme NO synthase.
7.7.0.0.2.5	When the acetylcholine receptor on the surface of an endothelial cell is activated, IP3 is released from the membrane (via the pathway shown in Figure 7.13), causing a calcium channel in the ER membrane to open and a subsequent increase in cytosolic Ca2+.
7.7.0.0.2.6	The Ca2+ then activates NO synthase to produce NO. NO is chemically very unstable, readily reacting with oxygen gas as well as other small molecules.
7.7.0.0.2.7	Although NO diffuses readily, it does not get far.
7.7.0.0.2.8	Conveniently, the endothelial cells are close to the underlying smooth muscle cells, where NO activates an enzyme called guanylyl cyclase (a close relative of adenylyl cyclase).
7.7.0.0.2.9	This enzyme catalyzes the formation of cyclic GMP (cGMP): yet another second messenger that contributes to the relaxation of muscle cells.
7.7.0.0.3.1	The discovery of NO as a participant in signal transduction explained the action of nitroglycerin, a drug that has been used for more than a century to treat angina, the chest pain caused by insufficient blood flow to the heart.
7.7.0.0.3.2	Nitroglycerin releases NO, which results in relaxation of the blood vessels and increased blood flow.
7.7.0.0.3.3	The drug sildenafil (Viagra) was developed to treat angina via the NO signal transduction pathway but was only modestly useful for that purpose.
7.7.0.0.3.4	However, men taking it reported more pronounced penile erections.
7.7.0.0.3.5	During sexual stimulation, NO acts as a signal, causing an increase in cGMP and a subsequent relaxation of the smooth muscles surrounding the arteries in the corpus cavernosum of the penis.
7.7.0.0.3.6	As a result of this signal, the penis fills with blood, producing an erection.
7.7.0.0.3.7	Sildenafil acts by inhibiting an enzyme (a phosphodiesterase) that breaks down cGMP   resulting in more cGMP and better erections.
7.7.0.0.1.1	Figure 7.14 Regulation of Signal Transduction
7.7.0.0.2.1	Cells can regulate the activity of a molecule involved in signal transduction.
7.7.0.0.2.2	The concentration of NO, which breaks down quickly, can be regulated only by how much of it is made.
7.7.0.0.2.3	By contrast, membrane pumps and ion channels regulate the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+, as you have seen.
7.7.0.0.2.4	To regulate protein kinase cascades, G proteins, and cAMP, there are enzymes that inactivate the activated transducer (Figure 7.14).
7.7.0.0.3.1	The balance between the activities of enzymes that activate and inactivate transducers determines the ultimate cellular response to a signal.
7.7.0.0.3.2	Cells can alter this balance in several ways:
7.7.0.0.4.1	Synthesis or breakdown of the enzymes.
7.7.0.0.4.2	For example, synthesis of adenylyl cyclase (which synthesizes cAMP) and breakdown of phosphodiesterase (which breaks down cAMP) would tilt the balance in favor of more cAMP in the cell.
7.7.0.0.5.1	Activation or inhibition of the enzymes by other molecules.
7.7.0.0.5.2	An example is the inhibition of phosphodiesterase by sildenafil.
7.7.0.0.6.1	Because cell signaling is so important in diseases such as cancer, a search is under way for new drugs that can modulate the activities of enzymes that participate in signal transduction pathways.
7.7.0.0.7.1	7.3 recap
7.7.0.0.8.1	Signal transduction is the series of steps between the binding of a signal to a receptor and the ultimate cellular response.
7.7.0.0.8.2	A protein kinase cascade amplifies a signal through a series of protein phosphorylation reactions.
7.7.0.0.8.3	In many cases, a second messenger amplifies and distributes the downstream effects of the signal.
7.7.0.0.8.4	The activity of transducer molecules is regulated.
7.7.0.0.9.1	learning outcomes
7.7.0.0.10.1	You should be able to:
7.7.0.0.11.1	Describe how a protein cascade amplifies a signal.
7.7.0.0.12.1	Explain how the same second-messenger molecule can be used in many different signal transduction pathways.
7.7.0.0.13.1	Explain how signal transduction pathways are regulated in a cell.
7.7.0.0.14.1	How can an activated G protein such as ras amplify a response to ligand binding?
7.7.0.0.15.1	Cyclic AMP is a second messenger in many different responses.
7.7.0.0.15.2	How can the same messenger act in different ways in different cells?
7.7.0.0.16.1	How are signal transduction cascades regulated?
7.7.0.0.17.1	You have seen how the binding of a signal to its receptor initiates the response of a cell to the signal, and how signal transduction pathways amplify the signal and distribute its effects to numerous targets in the cell.
7.7.0.0.17.2	In the next section we will look at the third step in the signal transduction process, the actual effects of the signal on cell function.
7.7.0.0.18.1	Chapter 7 continues with
7.7.0.0.19.1	7.4  Cells Change in Response to Signals in Several Ways
7.7.4.1.1	Ion  channels respond to signals by opening or closing
7.7.4.2.1	Enzyme activities change in response to signals
7.7.4.3.1	Signals can initiate DNA transcription
7.7.4.4.1	The effects of a signal on cell function take three primary forms: the opening of ion channels, changes in the activities of enzymes, or differential gene expression.
7.7.4.4.2	These events set the cell on a path for further and sometimes dramatic changes in form and function.
7.7.4.5.1	focus your learning
7.7.4.6.1	A cell can respond to signals by opening or closing ion channels.
7.7.4.7.1	A cell can respond to signals by altering gene transcription.
7.7.0.0.1.1	You have seen that ion channels can function as receptors in cell signaling (see Figure 7.5).
7.7.0.0.1.2	In Chapters 44 and 45, you will learn how signaling affects ion channels in the central nervous system and in senses, where stimulation of a receptor by light, sound, or touch can lead to opening of an ion channel.
7.7.0.0.1.3	A different type of ion channel response lies within some cells.
7.7.0.0.1.4	For example, signal transduction using the IP3   DAG pathway can result in the opening of Ca2+ channels in the ER membrane.
7.7.0.0.2.1	Oxytocin, which we described in the opening of this chapter, combines the two ion channel responses.
7.7.0.0.2.2	Oxytocin binds to a G protein-linked receptor (see Figure 7.7), which is expressed in brain tissue as well as muscles involved in birth and lactation.
7.7.0.0.2.3	Activation of the receptor results in signal transduction through the IP3   DAG pathway, releasing Ca2+ into the cytoplasm via ion channels.
7.7.0.0.2.4	In the brain, the effect of Ca2+ is to indirectly stimulate nerve cell activity by the opening of ion channels for Na+, as you will learn in Chapter 44.
7.7.0.0.2.5	To summarize: Oxytocin     Receptor     G protein activation     IP3 signal transduction    Ca2+ channel opening     Na+ channel opening
7.7.0.0.3.1	You saw in the opening of this chapter that the behavioral effect of oxytocin in voles involves bonding between them.
7.7.0.0.3.2	Does this also happen in people?
7.7.0.0.3.3	Neuroscientist Paul Zak at the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies thinks so.
7.7.0.0.3.4	He has done experiments with human volunteers and shown that oxytocin signaling is important in trusting behavior (Investigating Life: Is Oxytocin a    Trust  ?
7.7.0.0.3.5	Signal in Humans?).
7.7.0.0.3.6	Recently, it was shown that people who have an inherited defect in the oxytocin receptor act in some ways like the montane voles that lack oxytocin receptors: they are less trusting.
7.7.0.0.1.1	Enzymes are often modified during signal transduction   either covalently or noncovalently.
7.7.0.0.1.2	You have seen examples of both types of protein modifications earlier in this chapter.
7.7.0.0.1.3	For example, addition of a phosphate group to an enzyme by a protein kinase is a covalent change; cAMP binding is noncovalent.
7.7.0.0.1.4	Both types of modifications change the enzyme   s shape, activating or inhibiting its function.
7.7.0.0.1.5	In the case of activation, the shape change exposes a previously inaccessible active site, and the target enzyme goes on to perform a new cellular role.
7.7.0.0.2.1	The G protein-mediated protein kinase cascade that is stimulated by epinephrine in liver cells results in the activation by cAMP of a key signaling molecule, protein kinase A. In turn, protein kinase A phosphorylates two other *enzymes, with opposite effects:
7.7.0.0.3.1	Inhibition: Glycogen synthase, which catalyzes the joining of glucose molecules to synthesize the energy-storing molecule glycogen, is inactivated when a phosphate group is added to it by protein kinase A. Thus the epinephrine signal prevents glucose from being stored in the form of glycogen (Figure 7.15, step 1).
7.7.0.0.4.1	Activation: Phosphorylase kinase is activated when a phosphate group is added to it.
7.7.0.0.4.2	It is part of a protein kinase cascade that ultimately leads to the activation of glycogen phosphorylase, another key enzyme in glucose metabolism.
7.7.0.0.4.3	This enzyme results in the liberation of glucose molecules from glycogen (Figure 7.15, steps 2 and 3).
7.7.0.0.5.1	*connect the concepts Enzyme regulation determines the rate of chemical transformations in cells, and thus cell functions.
7.7.0.0.5.2	See Key Concept 8.5.
7.7.0.0.5.3	Figure 7.15 A Cascade of Reactions Leads to Altered Enzyme Activity
7.7.0.0.6.1	The amplification of the signal in this pathway is impressive; as detailed in Figure 7.15, each molecule of epinephrine that arrives at the cell membrane ultimately results in the release of 10,000 molecules of glucose into the bloodstream: 1 molecule of epinephrine bound to the membrane leads to 20 molecules of cAMP, which activate 20 molecules of protein kinase A, which activate 100 molecules of phosphorylase kinase, which activate 1,000 molecules of glycogen phosphorylase, which produce 10,000 molecules of glucose 1-phosphate, which produce 10,000 molecules of blood glucose

7.7.0.0.13.1	CONCLUSION
7.7.0.0.14.1	People (recipients) who trust another person (donor, experimental) will be more trustworthy than people who do not have that feeling.
7.7.0.0.15.1	Oxytocin levels are higher in people who are trustworthy.
7.7.0.0.16.1	work with the data
7.7.0.0.17.1	Original Paper: Kosfeld, M., M. Heinrichs, P. Zak, U. Fischbaker and E. Fehr. 2005.
7.7.0.0.17.2	Oxytocin increases trust in humans.
7.7.0.0.17.3	Nature 435: 673&#x2013;676.
7.7.0.0.18.1	Paul Zak used an economics experiment to investigate trust and found that when people felt that a stranger had trusted them with money, the recipients not only reciprocated by giving the donor some money back, but also had elevated levels of the intercellular signaling molecule oxytocin.
7.7.0.0.18.2	As in many experiments, although these data were suggestive of a relationship, correlation does not necessarily mean causation.
7.7.0.0.18.3	So Zak and his colleagues tried a direct experiment in which subjects were given oxytocin before the experiment, to determine if oxytocin induces greater trust.
7.7.0.0.19.1	QUESTIONS
7.7.0.0.20.1	In the experiment, donors were divided into control and experimental groups and paired with recipients.
7.7.0.0.20.2	All donors were given 12 money units and asked to donate to a paired recipient, whom they did not know or see.
7.7.0.0.20.3	Donors knew that whatever amount they donated would be tripled in the recipient&#x2019;s account (up to 36 units) and trusted that the recipient would generously give some money back to the donor.
7.7.0.0.20.4	The experimental donor group was given nasal spray containing oxytocin just before the experiment; the control donor group received a nasal spray without oxytocin.
7.7.0.0.20.5	The table shows the results. &#160; Average number of units (SD) sent to recipient Experimental group (with oxytocin spray) 9.6 (2.8) Control (no oxytocin spray) 8.1 (3.1)
7.7.0.0.21.1	What can you conclude from these data about oxytocin and trust in the donors?
7.7.0.0.21.2	What statistical test would you use to show that the two averages are significantly different?
7.7.0.0.22.1	The experiment described in Question 1 was repeated, but this time both donor groups were told exactly how much to give the recipient.
7.7.0.0.22.2	The results are shown in the table. &#160; Average number of units (SD) sent to recipient Experimental group (with oxytocin spray) 7.5 (3.3) Control (no oxytocin spray) 7.5 (3.4)
7.7.0.0.23.1	What can you conclude about the effect of oxytocin in this case, and what does it indicate about the trust relationship?
7.7.0.0.23.2	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.7.0.0.1.1	You learned in Key Concept 4.1 that the genetic material, DNA, is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into a protein whose amino acid sequence is specified by the original DNA sequence.
7.7.0.0.1.2	Proteins are important in all cellular functions, so a key way to regulate specific functions in a cell is to regulate which proteins are made, and therefore which DNA sequences are transcribed.
7.7.0.0.2.1	*Signal transduction plays an important role in determining which DNA sequences are transcribed.
7.7.0.0.2.2	Common targets of signal transduction are proteins called transcription factors, which bind to specific DNA sequences in the cell nucleus and activate or inactivate transcription of the adjacent DNA regions.
7.7.0.0.2.3	For example, the ras signaling pathway (see Figure 7.10) ends in the nucleus.
7.7.0.0.2.4	The final protein kinase in the ras signaling cascade, MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase; a mitogen is a type of signal that stimulates cell division), enters the nucleus and phosphorylates a protein that stimulates the expression of several genes involved in cell proliferation.
7.7.0.0.3.1	*connect the concepts In this chapter you   ve learned about signaling pathways that occur in animal cells.
7.7.0.0.3.2	Signal transduction pathways play equally important roles in other organisms, including plants, as we will explore extensively in Chapters 36 and 38.
7.7.0.0.4.1	7.4 recap
7.7.0.0.5.1	Cells respond to signal transduction by opening membrane channels, activating or inactivating enzymes, and stimulating or inhibiting gene transcription.

7.7.0.0.7.1	You should be able to:
7.7.0.0.8.1	Describe the signal transduction pathway stimulated by oxytocin.
7.7.0.0.9.1	Compare various mechanisms that cells use to respond to signals.
7.7.0.0.10.1	How does oxytocin signaling involve several signaling pathways?
7.7.0.0.11.1	Which method(s) of cell response to signaling are rapid and which are slower?
7.7.0.0.11.2	Explain.
7.7.0.0.12.1	We have described how signals from a cell   s environment can influence the cell.
7.7.0.0.12.2	But the environment of a cell in a multicellular organism is more than the extracellular medium   it includes neighboring cells as well.
7.7.0.0.12.3	In the next section we   ll see how specialized junctions between cells allow them to pass signals from one to another.
7.7.0.0.13.1	Chapter 7 continues with
7.7.0.0.14.1	7.5  Adjacent Cells in a Multicellular Organism Can Communicate Directly
7.7.5.1.1	How do animal cells directly communicate?
7.7.5.2.1	Plant cells communicate through plasmodesmata
7.7.5.3.1	Modern organisms provide clues about the evolution of cell   cell interactions and multicellularity
7.7.5.4.1	The hallmark of multicellular organisms is their ability to have specialized functions in subsets of cells within their bodies.
7.7.5.4.2	How do these cells communicate with one another so that they can work together for the good of the entire organism?
7.7.5.4.3	As you learned in Key Concept 7.1, some intercellular signals travel through the circulatory system to reach their target cells.
7.7.5.4.4	But cells also have more direct ways of communicating.
7.7.5.4.5	Cells that are packed together within a tissue can communicate directly with their neighbors via specialized intercellular junctions: gap junctions in animals (see Figure 6.7) and plasmodesmata in plants (see Figure 5.7).
7.7.5.5.1	focus your learning
7.7.5.6.1	Animal cells can communicate directly with other cells via gap junctions.
7.7.5.7.1	Development of intercellular communication was a key step in the evolution of multicellularity.
7.7.0.0.1.1	Figure 7.16 Communicating Junctions
7.7.0.0.2.1	Gap junctions are channels between adjacent cells that occur in many animals, occupying up to 25 percent of the area of the cell membrane (Figure 7.16A).
7.7.0.0.2.2	Gap junctions traverse the narrow space between the cell membranes of two adjacent cells (the    gap  ?) by means of channel structures called connexons.
7.7.0.0.2.3	The walls of a connexon are composed of six subunits of the integral membrane protein connexin.
7.7.0.0.2.4	In adjacent cells, two connexons come together to form a gap junction that links the cytoplasms of the two cells.
7.7.0.0.2.5	There may be hundreds of these channels between a cell and its neighbors.
7.7.0.0.2.6	The channel pores are about 1.5 nanometers (nm) in diameter   too narrow for the passage of large molecules but adequate for passage of small molecules and ions.
7.7.0.0.3.1	Here is an example of gap junctions at work: In the lens of the mammalian eye, only the cells at the periphery are close enough to the blood supply for adequate diffusion of nutrients and wastes.
7.7.0.0.3.2	But because lens cells are connected by large numbers of gap junctions, material can diffuse between them rapidly and efficiently.
7.7.0.0.3.3	Hormones and second messengers can move through gap junctions.
7.7.0.0.3.4	Sometimes just a few cells in a tissue have the receptor for a particular signal; in such cases, gap junctions allow a coordinated response to the signal by all the cells in the tissue.
7.7.0.0.1.1	Instead of gap junctions, plants have plasmodesmata (singular plasmodesma), which are membrane-lined tunnels that traverse the thick cell walls separating plant cells from one another.
7.7.0.0.1.2	A typical plant cell has several thousand plasmodesmata.
7.7.0.0.1.3	Plasmodesmata differ from gap junctions in one fundamental way: unlike gap junctions, in which the wall of the channel is made of integral membrane proteins from the adjacent cell membranes, plasmodesmata are lined by the fused cell membranes themselves.
7.7.0.0.2.1	The diameter of a plasmodesma is about 6 nm, far larger than a gap junction channel.
7.7.0.0.2.2	But the actual space available for diffusion is about the same   1.5 nm.
7.7.0.0.2.3	Examination of the interior of the plasmodesma by transmission electron microscopy reveals that a tubule called the desmotubule, apparently derived from the endoplasmic reticulum, fills up most of the opening of the plasmodesma (Figure 7.16B).
7.7.0.0.2.4	Typically, only small metabolites and ions can move between plant cells.
7.7.0.0.3.1	Plasmodesmata are vital in plants because their circulatory transport system, the vascular system, lacks the tiny vessels (capillaries) that many animals have for bringing gases and nutrients to every cell.
7.7.0.0.3.2	For instance, simple diffusion from plant cell to cell across cell membranes is inadequate to account for the movement of a plant hormone from the site of production to the site of action.
7.7.0.0.3.3	Instead, plants rely on more rapid diffusion through plasmodesmata to ensure that all cells of a tissue respond to a signal at the same time.
7.7.0.0.3.4	There are cases in which larger molecules or particles can pass between cells via plasmodesmata.
7.7.0.0.3.5	For example, some viruses can move through plasmodesmata by using    movement proteins  ? to assist their passage.
7.7.0.0.1.1	Multicellular organisms can indeed be multicellular   a human has about 60 trillion eukaryotic cells and many more prokaryotic ones.
7.7.0.0.1.2	But it   s not just cells that make up a human or a rose plant   it is groups of cells specialized into tissues and then groups of tissues in organs (e. g. , the nerve cells in the brain or the petals in a flower) that have specific roles.
7.7.0.0.1.3	As you will learn in Chapter 19, the embryonic development of tissues and organs takes place in several steps:
7.7.0.0.2.1	Migration of cells to form a group
7.7.0.0.3.1	Organization of cells in the cluster
7.7.0.0.4.1	Specialization of cells into tissues
7.7.0.0.5.1	Connections between cells
7.7.0.0.6.1	Even though single-celled organisms continue to be highly successful on Earth, over time complex multicellular organisms evolved, along with their division of biological labor among specialized cells.
7.7.0.0.6.2	The transition from single-celled to multicellular life took a long time.
7.7.0.0.6.3	Indeed, while there is evidence that single-celled organisms arose about 500 million to a billion years after the formation of Earth (see Chapter 4), the first evidence of true multicellular organisms dates from more than a billion years later.
7.7.0.0.6.4	Multicellularity probably arose several times.
7.7.0.0.7.1	Studying the evolutionary origin of multicellularity is a challenge because it happened so long ago.
7.7.0.0.7.2	The closest unicellular relatives of most modern animals and plants probably existed hundreds of millions of years ago.
7.7.0.0.7.3	The transition from single-celled to multicellular organisms may have occurred in several steps:
7.7.0.0.8.1	Aggregation of cells into a cluster
7.7.0.0.9.1	Intercellular communication within the cluster
7.7.0.0.10.1	Specialization of some cells within the cluster
7.7.0.0.11.1	Organization of specialized cells into groups (tissues)
7.7.0.0.12.1	Does this list look familiar?
7.7.0.0.12.2	(See above for the origin of organs in the embryo. )
7.7.0.0.13.1	A key event would have been the evolution of intercellular communication, which is necessary to coordinate the activities of different cells within a multicellular organism.
7.7.0.0.14.1	We can visualize how the evolution of multicellularity might have occurred by looking at the    Volvocine line  ? of aquatic green algae (Chlorophyta).
7.7.0.0.14.2	These plants range from single cells to complex multicellular organisms with differentiated cell clusters (Figure 7.17).
7.7.0.0.14.3	Included in this range are a single-celled organism (Chlamydomonas); an organism that occurs in small cell clusters (Gonium); species with larger cell clusters (Pandorina and Eudorina); a colony of somatic and reproductive cells (Pleodorina); and a larger, 1,000-celled alga with somatic and reproductive cells organized into separate tissues (Volvox).
7.7.0.0.14.4	Figure 7.17 Multicellularity
7.7.0.0.15.1	Q: Why was the evolution of direct communication important for tissue formation?
7.7.0.0.16.1	Chlamydomonas is the single-celled member of this group.
7.7.0.0.16.2	It has two cellular phases: a swimming phase, when the cells have flagella and move about, and a non-swimming phase, when the flagella are reabsorbed (disaggregated) and the cell undergoes cell division (reproduction).
7.7.0.0.16.3	Compare this with Volvox: most of the cells of this multicellular, spherical organism are on the surface; the beating of their flagella gives the organism a rolling motion as it swims toward light, where it can perform photosynthesis.
7.7.0.0.16.4	But some Volvox cells are larger and located inside the sphere.
7.7.0.0.16.5	These cells are specialized for reproduction: they lose their flagella and then divide to form offspring.
7.7.0.0.17.1	The separation of somatic and reproductive functions in Volvox is possible because of a key intercellular signaling mechanism that coordinates the activities of the separate tissues within the organism.
7.7.0.0.17.2	Volvox has a gene whose protein product is produced by the outer, motile cells and travels to the reproductive cells, causing them to lose their flagella and divide.
7.7.0.0.17.3	This gene is not active in species such as Gonium and Pandorina, which show cell aggregation but no cell specialization.
7.7.0.0.18.1	investigatinglife
7.7.0.0.19.1	Is oxytocin the &#x201C;trust&#x201D; signal in humans?
7.7.0.0.20.1	Paul Zak   s experiments showing the involvement of oxytocin in the trust involved in money transfers between people opened up a new field of study called neuroeconomics.
7.7.0.0.20.2	In 1759 the philosopher Adam Smith wrote that social and economic interactions between people are driven by what he called    fellow feeling.  ?
7.7.0.0.20.3	Now, 250 years later, the oxytocin studies validate this and have put it into the language of cell signaling.
7.7.0.0.20.4	What other things besides economic generosity release oxytocin?
7.7.0.0.20.5	Zak and others have shown that many pleasant activities, even massage and hugs, release oxytocin and induce positive behaviors as a result.
7.7.0.0.20.6	Oxytocin is released during sexual activity in humans, and the release results in bonding behaviors just as it does in voles.
7.7.0.0.20.7	Of course, oxytocin is now available for purchase.

7.7.0.0.21.1	Future directions
7.7.0.0.22.1	In this chapter you have seen how a natural substance such as caffeine acts on receptors to alter cell function.
7.7.0.0.22.2	As signal transduction pathways have been described for important processes such as the regulation of cell division, it has become possible to perturb intermediate steps in the pathway between signal and cell effects.
7.7.0.0.22.3	In the signaling that stimulates cells to reproduce, two important steps are the focus of intense interest.
7.7.0.0.22.4	One is at the cell membrane and involves the ras GTPase that converts GTP bound to ras to GDP that can be inactive in cancer cells (see Figure 7.9).
7.7.0.0.22.5	Drugs that target this GTPase make it more active, so there is less active ras in the cell and the signal transduction pathway for cell division does not get under way.
7.7.0.0.22.6	Another area of intense interest is an intermediate step in the phospholipase C pathway (see Figure 7.14) that involves the protein kinase mTOR.
7.7.0.0.22.7	Several drugs that target mTOR inactivate it, resulting in less cell division in tumor cells and cells involved in inflammation.

7.7.0.0.30.2	Hydra can reproduce asexually when cells on the body wall differentiate and form a bud, which then breaks off as a new organism.
7.7.0.0.30.3	Buds form only at certain distances from the apex, leading to the idea that the apex releases a signal molecule that diffuses down the body and, at high concentrations (i. e. , near the apex), inhibits bud formation.
7.7.0.0.30.4	Hydra lacks a circulatory system, so this inhibitor must diffuse from cell to cell.
7.7.0.0.30.5	If you have an antibody that binds to connexons and plugs up the gap junctions, how would you test the hypothesis that Hydra   s inhibitory factor passes through these junctions?

7.7.summary.34.1	Escherichia coli (Figure A) is a bacterium that lives in the human intestine, where it contributes to digestion by breaking down food molecules.
7.7.summary.34.2	You might think that these bacteria have a stable environment, but these microorganisms face a periodic threat.
7.7.summary.34.3	During digestion in the intestine, the solute concentrations around the bacteria fluctuate and at times exceed the solute concentration inside the cells.
7.7.summary.34.4	The cells must respond to this hypertonic environment to prevent desiccation due to water loss.
7.7.summary.35.1	Figure A
7.7.summary.36.1	To investigate how the bacterial cells manage this problem, researchers grew E. coli in two solutions.
7.7.summary.36.2	One solution was hypertonic, with a solute concentration higher than that inside the cell.
7.7.summary.36.3	The other solution was isotonic, with a solute concentration similar to that inside the cell.
7.7.summary.36.4	The researchers isolated membrane proteins from the cells and separated them according to size, using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
7.7.summary.36.5	After staining the proteins on the gel, one of the membrane proteins, OmpC, showed differences depending on the environmental conditions used to grow the cells.
7.7.summary.36.6	Figure B shows these results.
7.7.summary.36.7	The amount of stain is proportional to the amount of protein in the gel.
7.7.summary.37.1	Figure B
7.7.summary.38.1	The researchers suspected that a signal transduction pathway was involved in E. coli   s response to a hypertonic environment.
7.7.summary.38.2	They investigated whether any proteins became phosphorylated by a protein kinase as part of such a pathway.
7.7.summary.38.3	Interesting results were noted with respect to two proteins: a membrane protein (EnvZ) and a protein found in the cytoplasm (OmpR).
7.7.summary.38.4	After purifying EnvZ and OmpR from E. coli, each protein was incubated separately with 32P-radiolabeled ATP.
7.7.summary.38.5	This was done to examine protein phosphorylation: proteins that are phosphorylated in the presence of 32P-ATP become labeled 32P.

7.7.summary.40.1	Next, the researchers tried mixing 32P-radiolabeled EnvZ with OmpR.
7.7.summary.40.2	After mixing the two proteins, samples were removed from the mixture at 0, 2, 5, and 10 minutes.

7.8.10.1	How Aspirin Works
7.8.11.1	Despite suffering from the    ague,  ? the Reverend Edward Stone went walking in the English countryside.
7.8.11.2	Feverish, tired, with aching muscles and joints, he came across a willow tree.
7.8.11.3	Although apparently unaware that many ancient healers used willow bark extracts to reduce fever, the clergyman knew of the tradition of natural remedies for various diseases.
7.8.11.4	The willow reminded him of the bitter extracts from the bark of South American trees then being sold (at high prices) to treat fevers.
7.8.11.5	Removing some willow bark, Stone sucked on it and found it did indeed taste bitter   and that it relieved his symptoms.
7.8.12.1	Later he gathered a pound of willow bark and ground it into a powder, which he gave to about 50 people who complained of pain; all said they felt better.
7.8.12.2	Stone reported the results of this    clinical test  ? in a letter to the Royal Society, England   s most respected scientific body.
7.8.12.3	Stone had discovered salicylic acid, the basis of the most widely used drug in the world.
7.8.12.4	The date of his letter (which still exists) was April 25, 1763.
7.8.13.1	The chemical structure of salicylic acid (named for Salix, the willow genus) was worked out about 70 years later, and soon chemists could synthesize it in the laboratory.
7.8.13.2	Although the compound alleviated pain, its acidity irritated the digestive system.
7.8.13.3	In the late 1890s, the German chemical company Bayer synthesized a milder yet equally effective form, acetylsalicylic acid, which it marketed as aspirin.
7.8.13.4	The new medicine   s success launched Bayer to world prominence as a pharmaceutical company, a position it maintains today.
7.8.14.1	In the 1960s and 1970s, aspirin use declined somewhat when other pain-reducing medications became widely available.
7.8.14.2	But over this same time, clinical studies revealed a new use for aspirin: it is an effective anticoagulant, shown to prevent heart attacks and strokes caused by blood clots.
7.8.14.3	Today many people take a daily low dose of aspirin as a preventive against clotting disorders.
7.8.15.1	Fever, joint pain, headache, blood clots: What do these symptoms have in common?
7.8.15.2	They all are mediated by fatty acid products called prostaglandins and molecules derived from them.
7.8.15.3	Salicylic acid blocks the synthesis of the primary prostaglandin.
7.8.15.4	The biochemical mechanism by which aspirin works was described in 1971.
7.8.15.5	As we will see, an understanding of this mechanism requires an understanding of protein and enzyme function   two subjects of this chapter.
7.8.16.1	How do anti-inflammatory drugs work as enzyme inhibitors?
7.8.17.1	Chapter 8 continues with
7.8.18.1	8.1 Physical Principles Underlie Biological Energy Transformations
7.8.1.1.1	There are two basic types of energy
7.8.1.2.1	There are two basic types of metabolism
7.8.1.3.1	The first law of thermodynamics: Energy is neither created nor destroyed
7.8.1.4.1	The second law of thermodynamics: Disorder tends to increase
7.8.1.5.1	Not all Energy can be used
7.8.1.6.1	Disorder Tends to Increase
7.8.1.7.1	Chemical reactions release or consume energy
7.8.1.8.1	Chemical equilibrium and free energy are related
7.8.1.9.1	A chemical reaction occurs when atoms have sufficient energy to combine or change their bonding partners.
7.8.1.9.2	Consider the hydrolysis of the disaccharide sucrose to its component monomers, glucose and fructose (see p. 56 for the chemical structures of these sugars).
7.8.1.9.3	We can express this reaction by a chemical equation: Sucrose  +  H2O glucose + fructose (C12H22O11) (C6H12O6) (C6H12O6)
7.8.1.10.1	In this equation, sucrose and water are the reactants, and glucose and fructose are the products.
7.8.1.10.2	During the reaction, some of the bonds in sucrose and water are broken and new bonds are formed, resulting in products with chemical properties that are very different from those of the reactants.
7.8.1.10.3	The sum total of all the chemical reactions occurring in a biological system at a given time is called metabolism.
7.8.1.10.4	Metabolic reactions involve energy changes; for example, the energy contained in the chemical bonds of sucrose (reactants) is greater than the energy in the bonds of the two products, glucose and fructose.
7.8.1.11.1	focus your learning
7.8.1.12.1	The second law of thermodynamics states that disorder is constantly increasing in the universe.
7.8.1.13.1	Chemical reactions in biological systems are either exergonic or endergonic.
7.8.1.14.1	Physicists define energy as the capacity to do work, which occurs when a force operates on an object over a distance.
7.8.1.14.2	In biochemistry, it is more useful to think of energy as the capacity for change.
7.8.1.14.3	In biochemical reactions, energy changes are usually associated with changes in the chemical compositions and properties of molecules.
7.8.0.0.1.1	Energy comes in many forms: chemical, electrical, heat, light, and mechanical (Table 8.1).
7.8.0.0.1.2	But all forms of energy can be considered as one of two basic types (Figure 8.1): table 8.1 Energy in Biology Form of energy Example in biology Chemical: Stored in bonds Chemical energy stored in covalent bonds is released during the hydrolysis of polymers Electrical: Separation of charges Electrical gradients across cell membranes help drive the movement of ions through channels Heat: Transfer due to temperature difference Heat can be released by chemical reactions, and this can alter the internal temperature of an organism Light: Electromagnetic radiation stored as photons Light energy is captured by pigments in the eye and by plant pigments in photosynthesis Mechanical: Energy of motion Mechanical energy is used in muscle movements and movements within cells Figure 8.1 Energy Conversions and Work
7.8.0.0.2.1	Potential energy is the energy of state or position   that is, stored energy.
7.8.0.0.2.2	It can be stored in many forms: in chemical bonds, as a concentration gradient, or even as an electric charge imbalance.
7.8.0.0.3.1	Kinetic energy is the energy of movement   that is, the type of energy that does work, that makes things change.
7.8.0.0.3.2	For example, heat causes molecular motions and can even break chemical bonds.
7.8.0.0.4.1	Potential energy can be converted into kinetic energy and vice versa, and the form that the energy takes can also be converted.
7.8.0.0.4.2	Think of reading this book: light energy is converted to chemical energy in your eyes, and then is converted to electrical energy in the nerve cells that carry messages to your brain.
7.8.0.0.4.3	When you decide to turn a page, the electrical and chemical energy of nerves and muscles are converted to kinetic energy for movement of your hand and arm.
7.8.0.0.1.1	Energy changes in living systems usually occur as chemical changes, in which energy is stored in, or released from, chemical bonds.
7.8.0.0.2.1	Anabolic reactions (collectively anabolism) link smaller molecules to form larger, more complex molecules (for example, the synthesis of sucrose from glucose and fructose).
7.8.0.0.2.2	Anabolic reactions require an input of energy.
7.8.0.0.2.3	Energy is captured in the chemical bonds that are formed (for example, the glycosidic bond between the two monosaccharides).
7.8.0.0.2.4	This captured energy is stored in the chemical bonds as potential energy:
7.8.0.0.3.1	Glucose + fructose + energy     Sucrose
7.8.0.0.4.1	Catabolic reactions (collectively catabolism) break down larger, more complex molecules into smaller ones and often release the energy stored in the chemical bonds.
7.8.0.0.4.2	For example, when sucrose is hydrolyzed, energy is released.
7.8.0.0.4.3	In a biological system the released energy may be recaptured in new chemical bonds, or it may be used as kinetic energy   moving atoms, molecules, cells, or the whole organism:
7.8.0.0.5.1	Sucrose + H2O     Glucose + fructose + energy
7.8.0.0.6.1	Catabolic and anabolic reactions are often linked.
7.8.0.0.6.2	The energy released in catabolic reactions is often used to drive anabolic reactions    that is, to do biological work.
7.8.0.0.6.3	For example, the energy released by the breakdown of glucose (catabolism) is used to drive anabolic reactions such as the synthesis of triglycerides.
7.8.0.0.6.4	This is why you can accumulate fat if you eat food in excess of your energy requirements.
7.8.0.0.7.1	The laws of thermodynamics (thermo,    energy,  ? + dynamics,    change  ?) were derived from studies of the fundamental physical properties of energy, and the ways it interacts with matter.
7.8.0.0.7.2	The laws apply to all matter and all energy transformations in the universe.
7.8.0.0.7.3	Their application to living systems helps us understand how organisms and cells harvest and transform energy to sustain life.
7.8.0.0.1.1	The first law of thermodynamics states that in any energy conversion, energy is neither created nor destroyed.
7.8.0.0.1.2	In other words, during any conversion of energy, the total energy in the system under consideration before and after the conversion is the same (Figure 8.2A).
7.8.0.0.1.3	As you will see in the next two chapters, the potential energy present in the chemical bonds of carbohydrates and lipids can be converted to potential energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
7.8.0.0.1.4	This can then be converted into kinetic energy to do mechanical work (such as in muscle contractions) or biochemical work (such as protein synthesis).
7.8.0.0.1.5	Figure 8.2 The Laws of Thermodynamics
7.8.0.0.2.1	(A) The first law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed.
7.8.0.0.2.2	(B) The second law states that after energy transformations, some energy becomes unavailable to do work.
7.8.0.0.1.1	Although energy cannot be created or destroyed, the second law of thermodynamics states that when energy is converted from one form to another, some of that energy becomes unavailable for doing work (Figure 8.2B).
7.8.0.0.1.2	In other words, no physical process or chemical reaction is 100 percent efficient; some of the released energy is lost to a form associated with disorder.
7.8.0.0.1.3	Think of disorder as a kind of randomness that is due to the thermal motion of particles; this energy is of such a low value and so dispersed that it is unusable.
7.8.0.0.1.4	Entropy is a measure of the disorder in a system.
7.8.0.0.2.1	It takes energy to impose order on a system.
7.8.0.0.2.2	Unless energy is applied to a system, it will be randomly arranged or disordered.
7.8.0.0.2.3	The second law applies to all energy transformations, but we will focus here on chemical reactions in living systems.
7.8.0.0.1.1	In any system, the total energy includes the usable energy that can do work and the unusable energy that is lost to disorder:
7.8.0.0.2.1	Total energy = usable energy + unusable energy
7.8.0.0.3.1	In biological systems, the total energy is called enthalpy (H).
7.8.0.0.3.2	The usable energy that can do work is called free energy (G).
7.8.0.0.3.3	Free energy is what cells require for all the chemical reactions involved in growth, cell division, and maintenance.
7.8.0.0.3.4	The unusable energy is represented by entropy (S) multiplied by the absolute temperature (T).
7.8.0.0.3.5	Thus we can rewrite the word equation above more precisely as:
7.8.0.0.4.1	Because we are interested in usable energy, we rearrange Equation 8.1:
7.8.0.0.5.1	Although we cannot measure G, H, or S absolutely, we can determine the change in each at a constant temperature.
7.8.0.0.5.2	Such energy changes are measured in calories (cal) or joules (J).1 A change (in energy, or another quantity) is represented by the Greek letter delta (   ).
7.8.0.0.5.3	The change in free energy (   G) of any chemical reaction is equal to the difference in free energy between the products and the reactants:
7.8.0.0.6.1	A change in free energy can be either positive or negative; that is, the free energy of the products can be more or less than the free energy of the reactants.
7.8.0.0.6.2	If the products have more free energy than the reactants, then there must have been some input of energy into the reaction.
7.8.0.0.6.3	(Remember that energy cannot be created, so some energy must have been added from an external source. )
7.8.0.0.7.1	At a constant temperature   G is defined in terms of the change in total energy (  H) and the change in entropy (   S):
7.8.0.0.8.1	Equation 8.4 tells us whether free energy is released or required by a chemical reaction:
7.8.0.0.9.1	If    G is negative (   G &lt; 0), free energy is released.
7.8.0.0.10.1	If    G is positive (   G &gt; 0), free energy is required.
7.8.0.0.11.1	If the necessary free energy is not available, the reaction does not occur.
7.8.0.0.11.2	The sign and magnitude of    G depend on the two factors on the right side of the equation:
7.8.0.0.12.1	H: In a chemical reaction,    H is the total amount of energy added to the system (   H &gt; 0) or released (   H &lt; 0).
7.8.0.0.13.1	S: Depending on the sign and magnitude of    S, the entire term, T   S, may be negative or positive, large or small.
7.8.0.0.13.2	In other words, in living systems at a constant temperature (no change in T), the magnitude and sign of    G can depend a lot on changes in entropy.
7.8.0.0.14.1	If a chemical reaction increases entropy, its products are more disordered or random than its reactants.
7.8.0.0.14.2	If there are more products than reactants, as in the hydrolysis of a protein to its amino acids, the products have considerable freedom to move around.
7.8.0.0.14.3	The disorder in a solution of amino acids will be large compared with that in the protein, in which peptide bonds and other forces prevent free movement.
7.8.0.0.14.4	So in hydrolysis, the change in entropy (   S) will be positive.
7.8.0.0.14.5	Conversely, if there are fewer products and they are more restrained in their movements than the reactants (as for amino acids being joined in a protein),    S will be negative.
7.8.0.0.1.1	The second law of thermodynamics also predicts that as a result of transformations involving energy, disorder tends to increase; some energy is always lost to random thermal motion (entropy).
7.8.0.0.1.2	Chemical changes, physical changes, and biological processes all tend to increase entropy (see Figure 8.2B), and this explains why some reactions proceed in one direction rather than another.
7.8.0.0.2.1	How does the second law apply to organisms?
7.8.0.0.2.2	Consider the human body, with its highly organized tissues and organs composed of large, complex molecules.
7.8.0.0.2.3	You might think that this order and complexity are in conflict with the second law   after all, entropy, or disorder, should be maximized   but they are not for two reasons:
7.8.0.0.3.1	Getting ordered is coupled to the generation of disorder.
7.8.0.0.3.2	Making 1 kg of a human body (soft tissues, not bones) requires the catabolism of about 10 kg of highly ordered biological materials (our food), which are converted into CO2, H2O, and other simple molecules.
7.8.0.0.3.3	So this process creates far more disorder (more energy is lost to entropy in the small molecules) than the amount of order (total energy; enthalpy) stored in large molecules in 1 kg of a person.
7.8.0.0.4.1	Life requires a constant input of energy to maintain order.
7.8.0.0.4.2	Without this energy, the complex structures of living systems would break down.
7.8.0.0.4.3	Because energy is used to generate and maintain order, there is no conflict with the second law of thermodynamics.
7.8.0.0.5.1	Having seen that the laws of thermodynamics apply to organisms, let   s see how these laws apply to biochemical reactions inside the cell.
7.8.0.0.1.1	As you saw earlier, anabolic reactions link simple molecules to form more complex molecules, so they tend to increase complexity (order) in the cell.
7.8.0.0.1.2	By contrast, catabolic reactions break down complex molecules into simpler ones, so they tend to decrease complexity (generate disorder).
7.8.0.0.2.1	Catabolic reactions may break down an ordered reactant into smaller, more randomly distributed products.
7.8.0.0.2.2	Reactions that release free energy (      G) are called exergonic reactions (Figure 8.3A).
7.8.0.0.2.3	For example:
7.8.0.0.3.1	Complex molecules     free energy + small molecules
7.8.0.0.4.1	Anabolic reactions may make a single product (a highly ordered substance) out of many smaller reactants (less ordered).
7.8.0.0.4.2	Reactions that require or consume free energy (+  G) are called endergonic reactions (Figure 8.3B).
7.8.0.0.4.3	For example:
7.8.0.0.5.1	Free energy + small molecules     complex molecules Figure 8.3 Exergonic and Endergonic Reactions
7.8.0.0.6.1	In principle, chemical reactions are reversible and can run both forward and backward.
7.8.0.0.6.2	For example, if compound A can be converted into compound B (A     B), then B, in principle, can be converted into A (B     A), although the concentrations of A and B determine which of these directions will be favored.
7.8.0.0.6.3	You can think of the overall reaction as resulting from competition between the forward and reverse reactions (A &#x021CC; B).
7.8.0.0.6.4	According to the law of mass action, increasing the concentration of A makes the forward reaction (A     B) happen more often than the reverse reaction, just as increasing the concentration of B favors the reverse reaction (B     A).
7.8.0.0.7.1	There are concentrations of A and B at which the forward and reverse reactions take place at the same rate.
7.8.0.0.7.2	At these concentrations, no further net change in the system is observable, although individual molecules are still forming and breaking apart.
7.8.0.0.7.3	This balance between forward and reverse reactions is known as chemical equilibrium.
7.8.0.0.7.4	Chemical equilibrium is a state of no net change, and a state in which    G = 0.
7.8.0.0.1.1	Every chemical reaction proceeds to a certain extent, but not necessarily to completion (all reactants converted into products).
7.8.0.0.1.2	Each reaction has a specific equilibrium point, which is related to the relative free energy content of the reactants and products.
7.8.0.0.1.3	To understand the principle of equilibrium, let   s consider the following example, which takes place inside most cells but which we can do in the lab.
7.8.0.0.1.4	This is the interconversion of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate, a rearrangement of a phosphate group from one position on the ring of carbon atoms to another:
7.8.0.0.2.1	Glucose 1-phosphate &#x21CC; glucose 6-phosphate Figure 8.4 Chemical Reactions Run to Equilibrium
7.8.0.0.3.1	Imagine that we start out with an aqueous solution of glucose 1-phosphate that has a concentration of 0.02 M. (M stands for molar concentration; see Key Concept 2.4. ) The solution is maintained under constant environmental conditions (25  C and pH 7).
7.8.0.0.3.2	As the reaction proceeds to equilibrium, the concentration of the product, glucose 6-phosphate, rises from 0 M to 0.019 M, while the concentration of the reactant, glucose 1-phosphate, falls from 0.02 M to 0.001 M, at which point, equilibrium is reached (Figure 8.4).
7.8.0.0.3.3	At equilibrium, the reverse reaction, from glucose 6-phosphate to glucose 1-phosphate, progresses at the same rate as the forward reaction.
7.8.0.0.4.1	At equilibrium, then, this reaction has a product-to-reactant ratio of 19:1 (0.019/0.001), so the forward reaction has gone 95 percent of the way to completion (   to the right,  ? as written above).
7.8.0.0.4.2	This result is obtained every time the experiment is run under the same conditions.
7.8.0.0.5.1	The change in free energy (   G) for any reaction is related directly to its point of equilibrium.
7.8.0.0.5.2	The further toward completion the point of equilibrium lies, the more free energy is released.
7.8.0.0.5.3	In an exergonic reaction,    G is a negative number.
7.8.0.0.5.4	The total value of    G also depends on the beginning concentrations of the reactants and products and other conditions such as temperature, pressure, and pH of the solution.
7.8.0.0.5.5	Biochemists often calculate    G using standard laboratory conditions: 25  C, one atmosphere pressure, one molar (1 M) concentrations of the solutes, and pH 7.
7.8.0.0.5.6	The standard free energy change calculated using these conditions is designated    G0.
7.8.0.0.5.7	In our example of the conversion of glucose 1-phosphate to glucose 6-phosphate,    G0 =    1.7 kcal/mol, or    7.1 kJ/mol.
7.8.0.0.6.1	A large, positive    G for a reaction means that it does not proceed to the right (A     B).
7.8.0.0.6.2	If the concentration of B is initially high relative to that of A, such a reaction runs    to the left  ?
7.8.0.0.6.3	(A   ?
7.8.0.0.6.4	B), and at equilibrium nearly all of B is converted into A. A    G value near zero is characteristic of a readily reversible reaction: reactants and products have almost the same free energies.
7.8.0.0.7.1	In Chapters 9 and 10 you will learn the biochemical conversions that extract energy from food and light.
7.8.0.0.7.2	In turn, this energy is used to synthesize carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins.
7.8.0.0.7.3	All of the chemical reactions carried out by living organisms are governed by the principles of thermodynamics and equilibrium.
7.8.0.0.8.1	8.1 recap
7.8.0.0.9.1	Two laws of thermodynamics govern energy transformations in biological systems.
7.8.0.0.9.2	A biochemical reaction can release or consume energy, and it may not run to completion, but instead end up at a point of equilibrium.
7.8.0.0.10.1	learning outcomes
7.8.0.0.11.1	You should be able to:
7.8.0.0.12.1	Apply the second law of thermodynamics to biological systems.
7.8.0.0.13.1	Differentiate between exergonic and endergonic reactions.
7.8.0.0.14.1	What is the difference between endergonic and exergonic reactions, and what is the importance of positive and negative    G?
7.8.0.0.15.1	What makes it possible for endergonic reactions to proceed in organisms?
7.8.0.0.16.1	The principles of thermodynamics that we have been discussing apply to all energy transformations in the universe, so they are very powerful and useful.
7.8.0.0.16.2	Now let   s apply them to reactions in cells that involve the currency of biological energy, ATP.
7.8.0.0.17.1	1A calorie is the amount of heat energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of pure water from 14.5  C to 15.5  C. In the SI system, energy is measured in joules. 1 J = 0.239 cal; conversely, 1 cal = 4.184 J. Thus, for example, 486 cal = 2,033 J, or 2.033 kJ.
7.8.0.0.17.2	Although they are defined here in terms of heat, the calorie and the joule are measures of mechanical, electrical, or chemical energy.
7.8.0.0.17.3	When you compare data on energy, always compare joules with joules and calories with calories.
7.8.0.0.18.1	Chapter 8 continues with
7.8.0.0.19.1	8.2 ATP Plays a Key Role in Biochemical Energetics
7.8.2.1.1	ATP hydrolysis releases energy
7.8.2.2.1	ATP couples exergonic and endergonic reactions
7.8.2.3.1	Cells use adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for the capture and transfer of the free energy they require to do chemical work.
7.8.2.3.2	ATP operates as a kind of    energy currency.  ?
7.8.2.3.3	Just as it is more efficient and convenient for you to trade money for a lunch in a caf   than to trade your actual labor, it   s useful for cells to have a single currency for transferring energy between different reactions and cell processes.
7.8.2.3.4	So some of the free energy that is released by exergonic reactions is captured in the formation of ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (HPO4 2   , which is commonly abbreviated to Pi).
7.8.2.3.5	The ATP can then be hydrolyzed in the cell to release free energy to drive endergonic reactions.
7.8.2.3.6	(In some reactions, guanosine triphosphate [GTP] is used as the energy transfer molecule instead of ATP, but we will focus on ATP here. )
7.8.2.4.1	focus your learning
7.8.2.5.1	ATP releases usable energy for a cell when hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi.
7.8.2.6.1	Through coupling reactions, ATP drives endergonic reactions using energy derived from exergonic reactions.
7.8.2.7.1	ATP has another important role in the cell beyond its use as an energy currency: it can be converted into a building block for nucleic acids (see Chapter 4).
7.8.2.7.2	The structure of ATP is similar to that of other nucleoside triphosphates, but two things about ATP make it especially useful to cells:
7.8.2.8.1	ATP releases a relatively large amount of energy when hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi.
7.8.2.9.1	ATP can phosphorylate (donate a phosphate group to) many different molecules, which gain some of the energy that was stored in the ATP.
7.8.0.0.1.1	An ATP molecule consists of the nitrogenous base adenine bonded to ribose (a sugar), which is attached to a sequence of three phosphate groups (Figure 8.5A).
7.8.0.0.1.2	The hydrolysis of a molecule of ATP yields free energy, as well as ADP and an inorganic phosphate ion (Pi).
7.8.0.0.1.3	Thus:
7.8.0.0.2.1	ATP + H2O     ADP + Pi + free energy
7.8.0.0.3.1	The important property of this reaction is that it is exergonic, releasing free energy.
7.8.0.0.3.2	Under standard laboratory conditions, the change in free energy (   G) for this reaction is about    7.3 kcal/mol (   30 kJ/mol).
7.8.0.0.3.3	However, under cellular conditions   G can be as much as    14 kcal/mol.
7.8.0.0.3.4	We give both values here because you will encounter them both and you should be aware of their origins.
7.8.0.0.3.5	Both are correct, but in different conditions.
7.8.0.0.4.1	Figure 8.5 ATP
7.8.0.0.5.1	A molecule of ATP can be hydrolyzed either to ADP and Pi, or to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and a pyrophosphate ion (P2O7 4   ; commonly abbreviated as PPi).
7.8.0.0.5.2	Two characteristics of ATP account for the free energy released by the loss of one or two of its phosphate groups:
7.8.0.0.6.1	Because phosphate groups are negatively charged and so repel each other, it takes energy to get two phosphates near enough to each other to make the covalent bond that links them together.
7.8.0.0.6.2	Some of this energy is stored as potential energy in the P~O bonds between the phosphates in ATP (the wavy line indicates a high-energy bond).
7.8.0.0.7.1	The free energy of this P~O bond (called a phosphoric acid anhydride bond) is much higher than the energy of the O   H bond that forms as a result of hydrolysis.
7.8.0.0.7.2	So it is the lower free energy state of the system that releases energy.
7.8.0.0.8.1	Cells use the energy released by ATP hydrolysis to fuel endergonic reactions (such as the biosynthesis of complex molecules), for active transport, for movement, and even for the production of light (bioluminescence).
7.8.0.0.8.2	Another interesting example of the use of ATP involves converting its chemical energy into light energy.
7.8.0.0.1.1	As you have just seen, the hydrolysis of ATP is exergonic and yields ADP, Pi, and more free energy (or AMP, PPi, and more free energy).
7.8.0.0.1.2	The reverse reaction, the formation of ATP from ADP and Pi, is endergonic and consumes as much free energy as is released by the hydrolysis of ATP:
7.8.0.0.2.1	ADP + Pi + free energy     ATP + H2O Figure 8.6 Coupling of Reactions
7.8.0.0.3.1	Many exergonic reactions in the cell can provide the energy to convert ADP into ATP.
7.8.0.0.3.2	For eukaryotes and many prokaryotes, the most important of these reactions is cellular respiration, in which some of the energy released from fuel molecules is captured in ATP.
7.8.0.0.3.3	The formation and hydrolysis of ATP constitute what might be called an    energy-coupling cycle,  ? in which ADP picks up energy from exergonic reactions to become ATP, which then donates energy to endergonic reactions.
7.8.0.0.3.4	ATP is the common component of these reactions and is the agent of coupling, as illustrated in Figure 8.6.
7.8.0.0.4.1	Figure 8.7 Coupling of ATP Hydrolysis to an Endergonic Reaction
7.8.0.0.5.1	Q: What would be the magnitude of the   G of a different conversion that could drive the synthesis of ATP?
7.8.0.0.6.1	Coupling of exergonic and endergonic reactions is very common in metabolism.
7.8.0.0.6.2	Free energy is captured and retained in the P~O bonds of ATP.
7.8.0.0.6.3	ATP then diffuses to another place in the cell, where its hydrolysis releases the free energy to drive an endergonic reaction.
7.8.0.0.6.4	For example, the formation of glucose 6-phosphate from glucose (Figure 8.7), which has a positive    G (is endergonic), will not proceed without the input of free energy from ATP hydrolysis, which has a negative    G (is exergonic).
7.8.0.0.6.5	The overall    G for the coupled reactions (when the two    Gs are added together) is negative.
7.8.0.0.6.6	Hence the reactions proceed exergonically when they are coupled by occurring at the same time and place, and glucose 6-phosphate is synthesized.
7.8.0.0.6.7	As you will see in Chapter 9, this is the initial reaction in the catabolism of glucose.
7.8.0.0.7.1	An active cell requires the production of millions of molecules of ATP per second to drive its biochemical machinery.
7.8.0.0.7.2	From previous chapters, you may already be familiar with some of the activities in the cell that require energy from the hydrolysis of ATP:
7.8.0.0.8.1	Active transport across a membrane (see Figure 6.14)
7.8.0.0.9.1	Condensation reactions that use enzymes to form polymers (see Figure 3.4A)
7.8.0.0.10.1	Modifications of cell signaling proteins by protein kinases (see Figure 7.15)
7.8.0.0.11.1	Motor proteins that move vesicles along microtubules (see Figure 5.19)
7.8.0.0.12.1	An ATP molecule is typically consumed within a second of its formation.
7.8.0.0.12.2	At rest, an average person produces and hydrolyzes about 40 kg of ATP per day   as much as some people weigh.
7.8.0.0.12.3	This means that each ATP molecule undergoes about 10,000 cycles of synthesis and hydrolysis every day!
7.8.0.0.13.1	8.2 recap
7.8.0.0.14.1	ATP is the    energy currency  ? of cells.
7.8.0.0.14.2	Potential energy is stored in the P~O bonds of ATP.
7.8.0.0.14.3	Some of the free energy released by exergonic reactions can be captured in the form of ATP.
7.8.0.0.14.4	This energy can then be released by ATP hydrolysis and used to drive endergonic reactions.
7.8.0.0.15.1	learning outcomes
7.8.0.0.16.1	You should be able to:
7.8.0.0.17.1	Explain the characteristics of ATP that account for the high free energy released during its hydrolysis to form ADP and Pi.
7.8.0.0.18.1	Analyze evidence to identify reactions as exergonic or endergonic.
7.8.0.0.19.1	Predict biochemical transformations that require coupling to ATP hydrolysis.
7.8.0.0.20.1	What chemical properties allow ATP to store energy?
7.8.0.0.21.1	The following is a biochemical reaction that involves ATP:
7.8.0.0.22.1	Phosphoenolpyruvate     pyruvate (   G = +10 kcal/mol)
7.8.0.0.23.1	Is the reaction exergonic or endergonic?
7.8.0.0.24.1	Is ATP hydrolyzed or formed during the reaction?
7.8.0.0.25.1	ATP is synthesized and used up very rapidly.
7.8.0.0.25.2	But these biochemical reactions   and nearly all the others that take place inside a cell   could not proceed so rapidly without the help of enzymes.
7.8.0.0.26.1	Chapter 8 continues with
7.8.0.0.27.1	8.3 Enzymes Speed Up Biochemical Transformations
7.8.3.1.1	To speed up a reaction, an energy barrier must be overcome
7.8.3.2.1	Enzymes bind specific reactants at their active sites
7.8.3.3.1	Enzymes lower the energy barrier but do not affect equilibrium
7.8.3.4.1	When we know the change in free energy (   G) of a reaction, we know where the equilibrium point of the reaction lies: the more negative the    G value is, the further the reaction proceeds to products and toward completion.
7.8.3.4.2	However,    G tells us nothing about the rate of a reaction   how fast it moves toward equilibrium.
7.8.3.4.3	When we measure reaction rates of biochemical reactions in the lab, it quickly becomes apparent that in terms of the rapid needs for the chemistry of life, reaction rates are very slow   in fact, so slow that the cells would not survive without a way to speed up the reactions.
7.8.3.4.4	That is the role of catalysts: substances that speed up reactions without themselves being permanently altered.
7.8.3.4.5	A catalyst does not cause a reaction to occur that would not proceed without it, but merely increases the rate of the reaction, allowing equilibrium to be approached more rapidly.
7.8.3.4.6	This is an important point: No catalyst makes a reaction occur that cannot otherwise occur.
7.8.3.5.1	focus your learning
7.8.3.6.1	Catalysts speed up the rate of a reaction but do not allow the occurrence of a reaction that would not otherwise take place.
7.8.3.7.1	Most enzymes are protein catalysts, and all enzymes have active sites where specific reactants called substrates bind and react to form products that diffuse away.
7.8.3.8.1	Enzymes do not alter the equilibrium point or free energy change in a reaction.
7.8.3.9.1	Most biological catalysts are proteins called enzymes.
7.8.3.9.2	A biological catalyst is a molecular framework or scaffold within which chemical catalysis takes place.
7.8.3.9.3	The enzyme binds the reactants and sometimes participates in the reaction itself; however, such participation does not permanently change the enzyme.
7.8.3.9.4	That   s the hallmark of any catalyst: It ends up in exactly the same chemical condition after a reaction as before it.
7.8.3.10.1	In this section we will discuss the energy barrier that controls the rate of a chemical reaction.
7.8.3.10.2	Then we will focus on the roles of enzymes: how they interact with specific reactants, how they lower the energy barrier, and how they permit reactions to proceed more quickly.
7.8.0.0.1.1	An exergonic reaction may release free energy, but without a catalyst it will take place very slowly because there is an energy barrier between reactants and products.
7.8.0.0.1.2	Think about the hydrolysis of sucrose, which we described in Key Concept 8.1:
7.8.0.0.2.1	Sucrose + H2O     glucose + fructose
7.8.0.0.3.1	In your body, this reaction is part of digestion.
7.8.0.0.3.2	Even if water is abundant, the sucrose molecule will only very rarely bind the H atom and the    OH group of water at the appropriate locations to break the covalent bond between glucose and fructose unless there is an input of energy to initiate the reaction.
7.8.0.0.3.3	Such an input of energy will place the sucrose into a reactive mode called the transition state.
7.8.0.0.3.4	The energy input required for sucrose to reach this state is called the activation energy (Ea).
7.8.0.0.3.5	Here   s a more familiar example that can show you the ideas of activation energy and transition state:
7.8.0.0.4.1	Fireworks + O2     CO2 + H2O + energy (heat and light)
7.8.0.0.5.1	Fireworks don   t start exploding until you give them a spark: that   s the activation energy.
7.8.0.0.5.2	It excites the molecules in the fireworks so they will react with oxygen in the air.
7.8.0.0.5.3	Once the transition state is reached, the explosive reaction occurs.
7.8.0.0.6.1	focus: key figure
7.8.0.0.7.1	Figure 8.8 Activation Energy Initiates Reactions (A)
7.8.0.0.8.1	In any chemical reaction, an initial stable state must become less stable before change is possible.
7.8.0.0.8.2	(B) A ball on a hillside provides a physical analogy for the biochemical principle graphed in (A).
7.8.0.0.9.1	Q: Would activation energy be required for an endergonic reaction?
7.8.0.0.10.1	Generally, exergonic reactions proceed only after the reactants are pushed over the energy barrier by some added energy.
7.8.0.0.10.2	The energy barrier thus represents the amount of energy needed to start the reaction, the activation energy (Focus: Key Figure 8.8A).
7.8.0.0.10.3	Recall the ball rolling down the hill in Figure 8.3A.
7.8.0.0.10.4	The ball has a lot of potential energy at the top of the hill.
7.8.0.0.10.5	However, if it is stuck in a small depression, it will not roll down the hill, even though that action is exergonic.
7.8.0.0.10.6	To start the ball rolling, a small amount of energy (activation energy) is needed to push it out of the depression (Focus: Key Figure 8.8B).
7.8.0.0.10.7	In a chemical reaction, the activation energy is the energy needed to change the reactants into unstable molecular forms called transition-state intermediates.
7.8.0.0.11.1	Transition-state intermediates have higher free energies than either the reactants or the products.
7.8.0.0.11.2	Their bonds may be stretched and therefore unstable.
7.8.0.0.11.3	Although the amount of activation energy needed for different reactions varies, it is often small compared with the change in free energy of the overall reaction.
7.8.0.0.11.4	The activation energy put in to start a reaction is recovered during the ensuing    downhill  ? phase of the reaction, so it is not a part of the net free energy change,    G (see Figure 8.8A).
7.8.0.0.12.1	Where does activation energy come from?
7.8.0.0.12.2	If reactants are at the human body temperature (37  C), they are moving around.
7.8.0.0.12.3	A few are moving fast enough that their kinetic energy can overcome the energy barrier, enter the transition state, and react.
7.8.0.0.12.4	So the reaction takes place   but very slowly.
7.8.0.0.12.5	If the system is heated, all the reactant molecules move faster and have more kinetic energy, and the reaction speeds up.
7.8.0.0.12.6	You have probably used this method in the chemistry laboratory or the kitchen.
7.8.0.0.13.1	However, adding heat to increase the average kinetic energy of the molecules so they can react would not work in living systems.
7.8.0.0.13.2	Such a nonspecific approach would accelerate all chemical reactions, including destructive ones such as the denaturation of proteins (see Chapter 3).
7.8.0.0.13.3	A more effective way to speed up a reaction in a living system is to lower the energy barrier by bringing the reactants close together.
7.8.0.0.13.4	In living cells, enzymes accomplish this task.
7.8.0.0.1.1	Catalysts increase the rates of chemical reactions.
7.8.0.0.1.2	Most nonbiological catalysts are nonspecific.
7.8.0.0.1.3	For example, powdered platinum catalyzes virtually any reaction in which molecular hydrogen (H2) is a reactant.
7.8.0.0.1.4	In contrast, most biological catalysts are highly specific.
7.8.0.0.1.5	An *enzyme usually recognizes and binds to only one or a few closely related reactants, yielding specific products.
7.8.0.0.2.1	*connect the concepts To understand enzymes and their activity, you must first understand the structures and chemical properties of proteins.
7.8.0.0.2.2	See Key Concept 3.2.
7.8.0.0.2.3	Figure 8.9 Enzyme and Substrate
7.8.0.0.3.1	In an enzyme-catalyzed reaction, the reactants are called substrates.
7.8.0.0.3.2	Substrate molecules bind to a particular place on the enzyme protein called the active site, where catalysis takes place (Figure 8.9).
7.8.0.0.3.3	The specificity of an enzyme in speeding up a particular reaction results from the exact three-dimensional shape and structure of its active site, into which only a narrow range of substrates can fit.
7.8.0.0.3.4	Other molecules   with different shapes, different functional groups, and different properties   cannot fit properly and bind to the active site.
7.8.0.0.3.5	This specificity is comparable to the specific binding of a membrane transport protein or receptor protein to its specific ligand, as described in Chapters 6 and 7.
7.8.0.0.4.1	The names of enzymes often reflect their functions and end with the suffix    ase.  ?
7.8.0.0.4.2	For example, the enzyme sucrase catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose, which we have referred to above:
7.8.0.0.5.1	Thousands of enzymes have been identified, each catalyzing the transformation of its particular substrate(s).
7.8.0.0.5.2	In general, enzymes fall into six categories:
7.8.0.0.6.1	Oxidoreductases transfer electrons between molecules, especially in energy metabolism.
7.8.0.0.6.2	An example of an enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is oxidoreductase:
7.8.0.0.7.1	A    + B     A + B
7.8.0.0.8.1	You will see other examples in the next two chapters.
7.8.0.0.9.1	Transferases transfer groups of atoms (functional groups) (see Figure 3.1) between molecules.
7.8.0.0.9.2	The basic reaction can be shown as:
7.8.0.0.10.1	AX + B     A + BX
7.8.0.0.11.1	where A = the donor, B = the acceptor, and X = the functional group.
7.8.0.0.11.2	For example, aminotransferases transfer    NH2 groups between molecules, linking carbohydrates and amino acids.
7.8.0.0.12.1	Hydrolases add water to covalent bonds to break down molecules.
7.8.0.0.12.2	An example (shown above) is sucrase, which hydrolyzes sucrose to its constituent monosaccharides.
7.8.0.0.13.1	Lyases catalyze the breaking of various&#160; chemical bonds by means other than hydrolysis and oxidation, often forming a new double bond or a new ring structure.
7.8.0.0.13.2	For example, a lyase catalyzes the cleavage of the phosphorus   oxygen bond of ATP:
7.8.0.0.14.1	ATP     cAMP + PPi
7.8.0.0.15.1	Isomerases move functional groups from one place to another within a molecule, forming an isomer with the same atoms, differently bonded.
7.8.0.0.15.2	For example, glucose and fructose are isomers of C6H12O6 (see Figure 3.17).
7.8.0.0.16.1	Ligases join two molecules together.
7.8.0.0.16.2	You will see examples of ligases when you learn about DNA replication in Chapter 13.
7.8.0.0.17.1	A special note on language: When biologists refer to an enzyme, they usually use a verb for its action.
7.8.0.0.17.2	For example, as noted above (#6), we used the words    ligases join   .  ?
7.8.0.0.17.3	It is important for you to realize that this wording is shorthand for what really happens: ligases catalyze the joining.
7.8.0.0.17.4	Enzymes don   t    do  ? the reaction; they catalyze it.
7.8.0.0.18.1	When a substrate binds to the active site of an enzyme, the result is called an enzyme   substrate complex (ES) (see Figure 8.9).
7.8.0.0.18.2	The *chemical forces that hold the complex together may include hydrogen bonding, electrical attraction, or temporary covalent bonding.
7.8.0.0.18.3	The enzyme   substrate complex gives rise to product and free enzyme:
7.8.0.0.19.1	E + S     ES     E + P
7.8.0.0.20.1	where E is the enzyme, S is the substrate, P is the product, and ES is the enzyme   substrate complex.
7.8.0.0.20.2	The free enzyme (E) is in the same chemical form at the end of the reaction as at the beginning.
7.8.0.0.20.3	While bound to the substrate, it may change chemically, but by the end of the reaction it has been restored to its initial form and is ready to bind more substrate.
7.8.0.0.21.1	*connect the concepts Binding of a substrate to an enzyme involves not just a    fit  ? but also noncovalent interactions between the enzyme and substrate.
7.8.0.0.21.2	See Key Concept 3.2 for an outline of noncovalent interactions.
7.8.0.0.22.1	The relationship between enzyme and substrate may seem familiar; it is analogous to the binding of a receptor and ligand that we described in Chapter 7.
7.8.0.0.22.2	In that instance, we described the affinity of a receptor for its ligand with the dissociation constant (KD).
7.8.0.0.22.3	The lower the KD, the tighter the binding.
7.8.0.0.22.4	For enzymes and their substrates, KD values are often in the range 10   5 to 10   6 M, which favors the formation of the ES.
7.8.0.0.22.5	In practical terms, the KD values of the ES are such that the binding between enzyme and substrate is somewhat reversible; the substrate can be released before the reaction.
7.8.0.0.22.6	However, many enzyme-catalyzed reactions will proceed because the ES is short-lived and the product(s) form quickly.
7.8.0.0.1.1	Figure 8.10 Enzymes Lower the Energy Barrier
7.8.0.0.2.1	Reactants that are bound to the enzyme, forming an enzyme   substrate complex, require less activation energy than do the transitionstate intermediates in the corresponding uncatalyzed reaction (Figure 8.10).
7.8.0.0.2.2	Thus the enzyme lowers the energy barrier for the reaction   it offers the reaction an easier path, speeding it up.
7.8.0.0.2.3	When an enzyme lowers the energy barrier, both the forward and the reverse reactions speed up, so the enzyme-catalyzed reaction proceeds toward equilibrium more rapidly than the uncatalyzed reaction.
7.8.0.0.2.4	The final equilibrium is the same with or without the enzyme.
7.8.0.0.2.5	Similarly, adding an enzyme to a reaction does not change the difference in free energy (   G) between the reactants and the products (see Figure 8.10).
7.8.0.0.3.1	Enzymes can change the rate of a reaction substantially.
7.8.0.0.3.2	For example, if a particular protein that has arginine as its terminal amino acid just sits in solution, the protein molecules tend toward disorder and the terminal peptide bonds break, releasing the arginine residues (   S increases).
7.8.0.0.3.3	Without an enzyme, this is a very slow reaction   it takes about 7 years for half of the protein molecules to undergo the reaction.
7.8.0.0.3.4	But, with the enzyme carboxypeptidase A catalyzing the reaction, half the arginines are released in less than a second!
7.8.0.0.3.5	Rate enhancement by enzymes varies from 1 million times to an amazing 1026 by sulfate monoesterases.
7.8.0.0.3.6	The consequence of catalysis for living cells is not difficult to imagine.
7.8.0.0.3.7	Such increased reaction rates make new realities possible.
7.8.0.0.4.1	8.3 recap
7.8.0.0.5.1	A chemical reaction requires a    push  ? over the energy barrier to get started.
7.8.0.0.5.2	An enzyme reduces the activation energy needed to start a reaction by binding the reactants (substrates), which speeds up the reaction.
7.8.0.0.5.3	Biological catalysts are highly specific; only a narrow range of substrates can fit into the enzyme   s active site, so generally only one specific reaction can be catalyzed by a given enzyme.
7.8.0.0.5.4	Enzymes affect only the rates at which reactions proceed   they do not affect the equilibrium or free energy associated with a given reaction.
7.8.0.0.6.1	learning outcomes
7.8.0.0.7.1	You should be able to:
7.8.0.0.8.1	Describe a catalyst.
7.8.0.0.9.1	Describe how an enzyme   substrate complex forms.
7.8.0.0.10.1	Describe the relationship between an enzyme and the equilibrium point of the reaction it catalyzes.
7.8.0.0.11.1	Explain how the structure of an enzyme makes that enzyme specific.
7.8.0.0.12.1	What is the relationship between an enzyme and the equilibrium point of a reaction?
7.8.0.0.13.1	When potatoes are peeled, the enzyme polyphenol oxidase causes discoloration by catalyzing the oxidation of certain molecules, using O2 as a substrate.
7.8.0.0.13.2	Explain these observations:
7.8.0.0.14.1	Browning is reduced in potatoes that are peeled under water and kept there.
7.8.0.0.15.1	Potatoes that have been boiled at 100&#x00B0;C and then cooled do not brown when they are sliced.
7.8.0.0.16.1	Now that you have a general understanding of the structures, functions, and specificities of enzymes, let   s look more closely at how they work.
7.8.0.0.17.1	Chapter 8 continues with
7.8.0.0.18.1	8.4 Enzymes Bring Substrates Together so Reactions Readily Occur
7.8.4.1.1	Enzymes can orient substrates
7.8.4.2.1	Enzymes can induce strain in the substrate
7.8.4.3.1	Enzymes can temporarily add chemical groups to substrates
7.8.4.4.1	The active site is specific to the substrate(s)
7.8.4.5.1	An enzyme changes shape when it binds a substrate
7.8.4.6.1	Molecular structure determines enzyme function
7.8.4.7.1	Not all enzymes are proteins
7.8.4.8.1	Some enzymes require other molecules in order to function
7.8.4.9.1	The substrate concentration affects the reaction rate
7.8.4.10.1	During and after the formation of the enzyme   substrate complex, chemical interactions occur.
7.8.4.10.2	These interactions contribute directly to the breaking of old bonds and the formation of new ones.
7.8.4.10.3	In catalyzing a reaction, an enzyme may use one or more strategies.
7.8.4.11.1	focus your learning
7.8.4.12.1	Several different mechanisms enable enzymes to speed up chemical reactions.
7.8.4.13.1	An enzyme may undergo a change in shape called induced fit as the result of binding its substrate.
7.8.4.14.1	Many enzymes require additional chemical partners to catalyze a chemical reaction.
7.8.4.15.1	The concentration of substrate influences the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction.
7.8.0.0.1.1	Figure 8.11 Life at the Active Site
7.8.0.0.2.1	When free in solution, substrates are moving from place to place randomly while at the same time vibrating, rotating, and tumbling around.
7.8.0.0.2.2	They may not have the proper orientation to interact when they collide.
7.8.0.0.2.3	Part of the activation energy needed to start a reaction is used to bring together specific atoms so that bonds can form (Figure 8.11A).
7.8.0.0.2.4	For example, if acetyl CoA and oxaloacetate are to form citrate (a step in the metabolism of glucose; see Key Concept 9.2), the two substrates must be oriented so that the carbon atom of the methyl group of acetyl CoA can form a covalent bond with the carbon atom of the carbonyl group of oxaloacetate.
7.8.0.0.2.5	The active site of the enzyme citrate synthase has just the right shape to bind these two molecules so that these atoms are adjacent.
7.8.0.0.1.1	Once a substrate has bound to its active site, an enzyme can cause bonds in the substrate to stretch, putting it in an unstable transition state (Figure 8.11B).
7.8.0.0.1.2	For example, lysozyme is a protective enzyme abundant in tears and saliva that destroys invading bacteria by cleaving peptidoglycans in their cell walls.
7.8.0.0.1.3	Lysozyme   s active site    stretches  ? the bonds between the glycan monomers, rendering the bonds unstable and more reactive to lysozyme   s other substrate, water.
7.8.0.0.1.1	The side chains (R groups) of an enzyme   s amino acids may be direct participants in making the enzyme   s substrates more chemically reactive (Figure 8.11C).
7.8.0.0.2.1	In acid   base catalysis, the acidic or basic side chains of the amino acids in the active site transfer H+ to or from the substrate, destabilizing a covalent bond in the substrate, and permitting it to break.
7.8.0.0.3.1	In covalent catalysis, a functional group in a side chain forms a temporary covalent bond with a portion of the substrate.
7.8.0.0.4.1	In metal ion catalysis, metal ions such as copper, iron, and manganese, which are often firmly bound to side chains of enzymes, can lose or gain electrons without detaching from the enzymes.
7.8.0.0.4.2	This ability makes them important participants in oxidation   reduction reactions, which involve the loss or gain of electrons.
7.8.0.0.1.1	Many enzymes are much larger than their substrates.
7.8.0.0.1.2	An enzyme is typically a protein containing hundreds of amino acids.
7.8.0.0.1.3	It may consist of a single folded polypeptide chain or of several subunits (see Key Concept 3.2).
7.8.0.0.1.4	Its substrate is generally a small molecule or a small part of a large molecule.
7.8.0.0.1.5	The active site of the enzyme is usually quite small, not more than 6 to 12 amino acids.
7.8.0.0.1.6	You may be asking yourself:
7.8.0.0.2.1	What features of the enzyme   s active site allow it to recognize and bind the substrate?
7.8.0.0.3.1	What is the role of the rest of the protein?
7.8.0.0.1.1	The remarkable ability of an enzyme to select exactly the right substrate(s) depends on a precise interlocking of molecular shapes and interactions of chemical groups at the active site.
7.8.0.0.1.2	The binding of a substrate to the active site depends on the same kinds of forces that maintain the tertiary structure of the enzyme: hydrogen bonds, the attraction and repulsion of electrically charged groups, and hydrophobic interactions.
7.8.0.0.1.3	The specific fit of the substrate in the active site of lysozyme is illustrated in Figures 8.9 and 8.11B.
7.8.0.0.1.1	Just as a membrane receptor protein may undergo precise changes in conformation upon binding to its ligand (see Chapter 7), some enzymes change their shapes when they bind their substrate(s).
7.8.0.0.1.2	These shape changes, which are called induced fit, alter the shape of the active site(s) of the enzyme.
7.8.0.0.2.1	An example of induced fit can be seen in the enzyme hexokinase (see Figure 8.7), which catalyzes the reaction
7.8.0.0.3.1	Glucose + ATP     glucose 6-phosphate + ADP
7.8.0.0.4.1	Figure 8.12 Some Enzymes Change Shape When Substrate Binds to Them
7.8.0.0.5.1	Q: Do covalent bonds in hexokinase break when it changes shape?
7.8.0.0.5.2	Explain.
7.8.0.0.6.1	Induced fit brings reactive side chains from the hexokinase active site into alignment with the substrates (Figure 8.12), facilitating its catalytic mechanisms.
7.8.0.0.6.2	Equally important, the folding of hexokinase to fit around the substrates (glucose and ATP) excludes water from the active site.
7.8.0.0.6.3	This is essential, because if water were present, the ATP could be hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi.
7.8.0.0.6.4	But since water is absent, the transfer of a phosphate from ATP to glucose is favored.
7.8.0.0.7.1	Induced fit at least partly indicates what the role(s) of the rest of the protein may be:
7.8.0.0.8.1	It provides a framework so that the amino acids of the active site are properly positioned in relation to the substrate(s).
7.8.0.0.9.1	It participates in significant changes in protein shape and structure that result in induced fit.
7.8.0.0.10.1	It provides binding sites for regulatory molecules (see Key Concept 8.5).
7.8.0.0.1.1	For most of the twentieth century, biologists thought that all enzymes were proteins.
7.8.0.0.1.2	After all, they reasoned, only proteins have the diversity of three-dimensional structures and functional groups to bind to substrates and catalyze their transformations (review Key Concept 3.2).
7.8.0.0.1.3	Then it was discovered that some RNA molecules can act as enzymes by catalyzing changes in substrates, in most cases other RNA molecules.
7.8.0.0.1.4	You will learn about RNA splicing in Key Concept 14.4.
7.8.0.0.1.5	Briefly, this involves a cell making a larger RNA that gets cut and spliced to remove internal region(s).
7.8.0.0.1.6	The splicing reaction is catalyzed by a ribozyme.
7.8.0.0.1.7	Another important ribozyme occurs at the ribosome, where an RNA molecule catalyzes the formation of a peptide bond between amino acids (see Key Concept 14.5).
7.8.0.0.2.1	In retrospect, it is not too surprising that some RNA molecules can act as biological catalysts (ribozymes).
7.8.0.0.2.2	As you saw in Figure 4.3, most RNAs are single strands of nucleotides that can fold back on themselves and form a three-dimensional structure by hydrogen bonding.
7.8.0.0.2.3	A substrate can fit into the RNA structure, and functional groups on the RNA (such as    NH2 and C==O) can be involved in catalysis.
7.8.0.0.1.1	Many enzymes require the presence of nonprotein chemical    partners  ? in order to function (Table 8.2):
7.8.0.0.2.1	Prosthetic groups are distinct, non   amino acid atoms or molecular groupings that are permanently bound to their enzymes.
7.8.0.0.2.2	An example is flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which is bound to succinate dehydrogenase, an important enzyme in cellular respiration (see Key Concept 9.3).
7.8.0.0.3.1	Inorganic cofactors include ions such as copper, zinc, and iron that are permanently bound to certain enzymes.
7.8.0.0.3.2	For example, the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase contains the cofactor zinc.
7.8.0.0.4.1	A coenzyme is a nonprotein carbon-containing molecule that is required for the action of one or more enzymes.
7.8.0.0.4.2	It is usually relatively small compared with the enzyme to which it binds. table 8.2 Some Examples of Nonprotein    Partners  ? of Enzymes Type of molecule Role in catalyzed reactions Prosthetic groups Heme Binds ions, O2, and electrons FAD Carries electrons/protons Retinal Converts light energy Inorganic cofactors Iron (Fe2+ or Fe3+) Oxidation/reduction Copper (Cu+ or Cu2+) Oxidation/reduction Zinc (Zn2+) Stabilizes DNA binding structure Coenzymes Biotin Carries    COO Coenzyme A Carries    CO   CH3 NAD Carries electrons/protons ATP Provides/extracts energy
7.8.0.0.5.1	A coenzyme moves from enzyme to enzyme, adding or removing chemical groups from the substrate.
7.8.0.0.5.2	A coenzyme is like a substrate in that it does not permanently bind to the enzyme: it binds to the active site, changes chemically during the reaction, and then separates from the enzyme to participate in other reactions.
7.8.0.0.5.3	There is actually no clear distinction between the functions of coenzymes and some substrates.
7.8.0.0.5.4	For example, ATP and ADP have been described as coenzymes, even though they are really substrates that gain or lose phosphate groups during chemical reactions.
7.8.0.0.5.5	The term    coenzyme  ? was coined before the functions of these molecules were fully understood.
7.8.0.0.5.6	Biochemists continue to use the term, and for consistency with the field, we use it in this book.
7.8.0.0.1.1	Figure 8.13 Catalyzed Reactions Reach a Maximum Rate
7.8.0.0.2.1	For a reaction of the type A     B, the rate of the uncatalyzed reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of A. The higher the concentration of substrate, the faster the rate of the reaction.
7.8.0.0.2.2	The appropriate enzyme not only speeds up the reaction; it also changes the shape of a plot of rate versus substrate concentration (Figure 8.13).
7.8.0.0.2.3	For a given concentration of enzyme, the rate of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction initially increases as the substrate concentration increases from zero, but then it levels off.
7.8.0.0.2.4	At some point, further increases in the substrate concentration do not significantly increase the reaction rate   the maximum rate has been reached.
7.8.0.0.3.1	The concentration of an enzyme is usually much lower than that of its substrate (e. g. , in cells expressing the enzyme sucrase, there are far more molecules of sucrose than of the enzyme).
7.8.0.0.3.2	As more and more substrate molecules bind to the available enzyme molecules, there is a saturation phenomenon like the one that occurs in facilitated diffusion (see Figure 6.12).
7.8.0.0.3.3	When all the enzyme molecules are bound with substrate molecules, the enzyme is working as fast as it can   at its maximum rate.
7.8.0.0.3.4	Nothing is gained by adding more substrate, because no free enzyme molecules are left to act as catalysts.
7.8.0.0.3.5	Under these conditions the active sites are said to be saturated.
7.8.0.0.4.1	The maximum rate of a catalyzed reaction can be used to measure how efficient the enzyme is.
7.8.0.0.4.2	The turnover number is the maximum number of substrate molecules that one enzyme molecule can convert to product per unit of time.
7.8.0.0.4.3	This number ranges from 1 molecule every 2 seconds for lysozyme to an amazing 40 million molecules per second for the liver enzyme catalase.
7.8.0.0.5.1	8.4 recap
7.8.0.0.6.1	Enzymes orient their substrates to bring together specific atoms so that bonds can form.
7.8.0.0.6.2	An enzyme can participate in the reaction it catalyzes by temporarily changing shape or destabilizing the enzyme   substrate complex.
7.8.0.0.6.3	Some enzymes require prosthetic groups, inorganic cofactors, or coenzymes in order to function.

7.8.0.0.11.1	Predict changes in the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction as factors in the reaction are varied.
7.8.0.0.12.1	The chemical composition of an enzyme before and after a catalyzed reaction is the same, but during the reaction an enzyme can change.

7.8.0.0.13.1	Compare enzymes and coenzymes with regard to chemical structure and function.
7.8.0.0.14.1	Plot reaction rate versus substrate concentration, and explain the shape of the curve.
7.8.0.0.15.1	You   ve seen in this section how individual enzymes work on their substrates.
7.8.0.0.15.2	However, enzymes inside organisms don   t operate in isolation   there may be thousands of different enzymes within a given cell.
7.8.0.0.15.3	Let   s see how all these different enzymes work together in a complex organism.

7.8.5.9.1	Temperature affects enzyme activity
7.8.5.10.1	The biochemical reactions in cells operate within metabolic pathways in which the product of one reaction is a reactant for the next.
7.8.5.10.2	These pathways do not exist in isolation, but interact extensively, and each reaction in each pathway is catalyzed by a specific enzyme.
7.8.5.11.1	focus your learning
7.8.5.12.1	The cell carries out large numbers of metabolic reactions that are interconnected and regulated by the enzymes that catalyze them.
7.8.5.13.1	Small molecules can regulate enzyme activity by binding to and activating or inhibiting an enzyme.
7.8.5.14.1	Allosteric regulation results from the binding of regulator molecules to sites on an enzyme other than the active site.
7.8.5.15.1	Environmental factors such as pH and temperature affect enzyme activity.
7.8.5.16.1	Within a cell or organism, the presence and activity of enzymes determine the    flow  ? of chemicals through different metabolic pathways.
7.8.5.16.2	The amount of enzyme activity, in turn, can be controlled in two ways:
7.8.5.17.1	Regulation of gene expression.
7.8.5.17.2	The gene for an enzyme protein may be expressed more or less, resulting in more or fewer enzyme molecules in the cell.
7.8.5.17.3	You learned in Chapter 7 that some signal transduction pathways result in changes in gene expression, and that often the genes that are switched on or off encode enzymes.
7.8.5.18.1	Regulation of enzyme activity.
7.8.5.18.2	The enzyme may change its shape to hide its active site from the substrate, or a regulator molecule may prevent the substrate from reaching the active site.
7.8.5.18.3	Blocking the activity of a single enzyme can affect an entire metabolic pathway.
7.8.5.19.1	Figure 8.14 Metabolic Pathways
7.8.5.20.1	The flow of molecules through interacting metabolic pathways can be studied, but this process quickly becomes complicated, because each pathway influences the others.
7.8.5.20.2	Computer algorithms are used to model these pathways and show how they mesh in an interdependent system (Figure 8.14).
7.8.5.20.3	Such models can help predict what will happen if the concentration of one molecule or another is altered.
7.8.5.20.4	This new field of biology is called systems biology, and it has numerous applications.
7.8.5.21.1	In this section we will investigate the roles of enzymes in organizing and regulating metabolic pathways.
7.8.5.21.2	We will also examine how the environment   particularly temperature and pH   affects enzyme activity.
7.8.0.0.1.1	Various chemical inhibitors can bind to enzymes, slowing down the rates of the reactions they catalyze.
7.8.0.0.1.2	Some inhibitors occur naturally in cells; others are artificial.
7.8.0.0.1.3	Naturally occurring inhibitors regulate metabolism; artificial ones can be used to treat disease, to kill pests, or to study how enzymes work.
7.8.0.0.1.4	In some cases the inhibitor binds the enzyme irreversibly, and the enzyme becomes permanently inactivated.
7.8.0.0.1.5	In other cases the inhibitor has reversible effects; it can separate from the enzyme, allowing the enzyme to function fully as before.
7.8.0.0.1.6	The removal of a natural reversible inhibitor increases an enzyme   s rate of catalysis.
7.8.0.0.1.1	Figure 8.15 Irreversible Inhibition
7.8.0.0.2.1	If an inhibitor covalently binds to certain side chains at the active site of an enzyme, it will permanently inactivate the enzyme by destroying its capacity to interact with its normal substrate.
7.8.0.0.2.2	An example of an irreversible inhibitor is aspirin, which was described in the opening of this chapter.
7.8.0.0.2.3	Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) binds to a target enzyme called cyclooxygenase (COX) near its active site.
7.8.0.0.2.4	When it binds, aspirin releases its acetyl group (   CH2CH3) and this group of atoms is transferred to bond covalently to serine at its polar hydroxyl group (Figure 8.15).
7.8.0.0.2.5	The group of atoms now    coating  ? serine sticks out into a channel in the protein and prevents the substrate, arachidonic acid, from reaching the active site.
7.8.0.0.2.6	So prostaglandin is no longer produced and its stimulation of inflammation and pain are blocked.
7.8.0.0.2.7	The elucidation of the mechanism of aspirin   s action as an inhibitor of a pathway involved in inflammation was a landmark in modern pharmacology, the study of drugs (Investigating Life: How Do Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Work as Enzyme Inhibitors?).
7.8.0.0.1.1	In some cases an inhibitor is similar enough to a particular enzyme   s natural substrate to bind noncovalently to its active site, yet different enough that the enzyme catalyzes no chemical reaction.
7.8.0.0.1.2	While such a molecule is bound to the enzyme, the natural substrate cannot enter the active site and the enzyme is unable to function.
7.8.0.0.1.3	Such a molecule is called a competitive inhibitor because it competes with the natural substrate for the active site (Figure 8.16A and B).
7.8.0.0.1.4	In this case, the degree of inhibition depends on the relative concentrations of the substrate and the inhibitor: if the inhibitor concentration is higher, it is more likely to bind the active site of the enzyme than the substrate, and vice versa.
7.8.0.0.1.5	The inhibition is reversible because if the concentration of substrate is increased or if the concentration of inhibitor is reduced, the substrate is more likely to bind, and the enzyme is active again.
7.8.0.0.2.1	Figure 8.16 Reversible Inhibition
7.8.0.0.3.1	An example of a competitive inhibitor is the drug methotrexate.
7.8.0.0.3.2	An important coenzyme in the formation of purines (components of nucleic acids) is tetrahydrofolate, which is formed from dihydrofolate in a reaction catalyzed by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR):
7.8.0.0.4.1	When cancer cells reproduce, they need to replicate their DNA, and so they need to produce purines.
7.8.0.0.4.2	This makes DHFR an ideal target for an anticancer drug.
7.8.0.0.4.3	A team led by Sidney Farber at Harvard Medical School first showed that an analog of dihydrofolate could treat leukemia.
7.8.0.0.4.4	The drug used by Farber (aminopterin) has since been replaced by a similar analog, methotrexate:
7.8.0.0.5.1	This successful drug is used to treat inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as cancer.
7.8.0.0.6.1	An uncompetitive inhibitor (Figure 8.16C) binds to the enzyme   substrate complex, preventing the complex from releasing products.
7.8.0.0.6.2	Unlike competitive inhibition, uncompetitive inhibition cannot be overcome by adding more substrate.
7.8.0.0.7.1	A noncompetitive inhibitor binds to an unbound enzyme at a site distinct from the active site.
7.8.0.0.7.2	Binding causes a change in the shape of the enzyme that alters its activity (Figure 8.16D).
7.8.0.0.7.3	The active site may no longer bind the substrate, or if it does, the rate of product formation may be reduced.
7.8.0.0.7.4	Like competitive inhibitors, noncompetitive inhibitors can become unbound, so their effects are reversible.

7.8.0.0.13.3	Working at England   s Royal College of Surgeons, a group led by John Vane showed that aspirin acts instead as an inhibitor of the enzymatic reaction that produces prostaglandin (PG), a fatty acid derivative important in inflammation.

7.8.0.0.16.1	RESULTS
7.8.0.0.17.1	CONCLUSION In both animal and human cells, aspirin blocks the synthesis of the pro-inflammatory molecule, prostaglandin, in test tube experiments.
7.8.0.0.18.1	work with the data
7.8.0.0.19.1	For his discovery of the mechanism by which aspirin relieves pain, John Vane was awarded the Nobel Prize and knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.
7.8.0.0.19.2	Key to the experiments was the assumption that enzyme activity and mechanism are the same outside the organism as they are inside.
7.8.0.0.19.3	In the lab, if given its substrate and the same set of environmental conditions as in the cytoplasm, an enzyme will catalyze production of its product.
7.8.0.0.20.1	QUESTIONS
7.8.0.0.21.1	In the first set of experiments, lung tissue from guinea pigs was broken up to form a cell-free extract (homogenate).
7.8.0.0.21.2	The substrate, arachidonic acid, was added to the extract, and after 30 min the amount of prostaglandin (PG) was measured.
7.8.0.0.21.3	The results are shown in Table A. Plot PG synthesis versus aspirin concentration.
7.8.0.0.21.4	What can you conclude?
7.8.0.0.22.1	A similar set of experiments was performed on human platelets (membrane-bound cell fragments derived from white blood cells).
7.8.0.0.22.2	These cells are known to produce PG by the same enzyme mechanism as lung tissue under certain environmental conditions.
7.8.0.0.22.3	The results are shown in Table B. What can you conclude from these results and about the generalizability of your conclusion from Question 1?
7.8.0.0.23.1	Table A Aspirin concentration (  g/mL) PG synthesis (ng) 0 220 1 172 2 136 10 99 50 33 80 0
7.8.0.0.24.1	Table B Aspirin concentration (  g/mL) PG synthesis (ng) 0 53 0.01 48 0.1 35 1 18 10 7
7.8.0.0.25.1	In a third set of experiments, platelets were isolated from human volunteers and their ability to make PG was measured (no aspirin present).
7.8.0.0.25.2	Then these people were given a clinically effective dose of aspirin, and after a short period their platelets were isolated and PG synthesis measured (again, no aspirin in the test tube experiments).
7.8.0.0.25.3	The results from three people are shown in Table C. How do these data either reinforce or refute your conclusion from Questions 1 and 2?
7.8.0.0.26.1	Table C Prostaglandin synthesis (ng) Individual Before aspirin After aspirin 1 160 16 2 108 5 3 103 20
7.8.0.0.27.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.8.0.0.1.1	The change in enzyme shape that is due to noncompetitive inhibitor binding is an example of allostery (allo,    different,  ? + stereos,    shape  ?).
7.8.0.0.1.2	Allosteric regulation occurs when an effector molecule binds to a site other than the active site of an enzyme, inducing the enzyme to change its shape.
7.8.0.0.1.3	The change in shape alters the affinity of the active site for the substrate, and so the rate of the reaction is changed.
7.8.0.0.2.1	Often, an enzyme will exist in the cell in more than one possible shape (Figure 8.17):
7.8.0.0.3.1	Figure 8.17 Allosteric Regulation of Enzymes
7.8.0.0.4.1	Active and inactive forms of an enzyme can be interconverted, depending on the binding of effector molecules at sites other than the active site.
7.8.0.0.4.2	Binding an inhibitor stabilizes the inactive form, and binding an activator stabilizes the active form.
7.8.0.0.5.1	The active form of the enzyme has the proper shape for substrate binding.
7.8.0.0.6.1	The inactive form of the enzyme has a shape that cannot bind the substrate.
7.8.0.0.7.1	Other molecules, collectively referred to as effectors, can influence which form the enzyme takes:
7.8.0.0.8.1	Binding of an inhibitor to a site other than the active site can stabilize the inactive form of the enzyme, making it less likely to convert to the active form.
7.8.0.0.9.1	The active form can be stabilized by the binding of an activator to another site on the enzyme.
7.8.0.0.10.1	Like substrate binding, the binding of inhibitors and activators to their regulatory sites (also called allosteric sites) is highly specific.
7.8.0.0.10.2	Most (but not all) enzymes that are allosterically regulated are proteins with quaternary structure; that is, they are made up of multiple polypeptide subunits.
7.8.0.0.10.3	The polypeptide that has the active site is called the catalytic subunit.
7.8.0.0.10.4	The allosteric sites are often located on different polypeptides, called the regulatory subunits (see Figure 8.17).
7.8.0.0.11.1	Some enzymes have multiple subunits containing active sites, and the binding of substrate to one of the active sites causes allosteric effects.
7.8.0.0.11.2	When substrate binds to one subunit, there is a slight change in protein structure that influences the adjacent subunit.
7.8.0.0.11.3	The slight change to the second subunit makes its active site more likely to bind to the substrate.
7.8.0.0.11.4	So the reaction speeds up as the sites become sequentially activated.
7.8.0.0.12.1	As a result, an allosteric enzyme with multiple active sites and a nonallosteric enzyme with a single active site differ greatly in their reaction rates when the substrate concentration is low.
7.8.0.0.12.2	Graphs of reaction rates plotted against substrate concentrations show this relationship.
7.8.0.0.12.3	For a nonallosteric enzyme, the plot is hyperbolic:
7.8.0.0.13.1	The reaction rate first increases sharply with increasing substrate concentration, then tapers off to a constant maximum rate as the supply of enzyme becomes saturated.
7.8.0.0.14.1	For a multisubunit allosteric enzyme, the graph looks different, having a sigmoid (S-shaped) appearance:
7.8.0.0.15.1	At low substrate concentrations, the reaction rate increases only gradually as substrate concentration increases.
7.8.0.0.15.2	After the substrate binds to the first active site of the enzyme (the slowly increasing part of the curve), there is a change in the enzyme   s quaternary structure such that the other sites become more likely to bind substrate, so the reaction speeds up (the rapidly increasing part of the curve).
7.8.0.0.15.3	Once all sites are saturated with substrate, the reaction rate reaches a plateau (the upper, flat part of the curve).
7.8.0.0.15.4	Within a certain range, the reaction rate is extremely sensitive to relatively small changes in substrate concentration.
7.8.0.0.15.5	In addition, allosteric enzymes are very sensitive to low concentrations of inhibitors.
7.8.0.0.15.6	Because of this sensitivity, allosteric enzymes are important in regulating entire metabolic pathways.
7.8.0.0.1.1	Metabolic pathways typically involve a starting material, various intermediate products, and an end product that is used for some purpose by the cell.
7.8.0.0.1.2	In each pathway there are a number of reactions, each forming an intermediate product and each catalyzed by a different *enzyme.
7.8.0.0.1.3	The first step in a pathway is called the commitment step, meaning that once this enzyme-catalyzed reaction occurs, the    ball is rolling,  ? and the other reactions happen in sequence, leading to the end product.
7.8.0.0.1.4	But what if the cell has no requirement for that product   for example, if that product is available from its environment in adequate amounts?
7.8.0.0.1.5	It would be energetically wasteful for the cell to continue making something it does not need.
7.8.0.0.2.1	*connect the concepts The number of molecules of a particular enzyme present in a cell at a given time is controlled in large part by the synthesis of that protein.
7.8.0.0.2.2	See Key Concept 16.1 for a discussion of the regulation of protein synthesis.
7.8.0.0.3.1	Figure 8.18 Feedback Inhibition of Metabolic Pathways
7.8.0.0.4.1	One way to avoid this problem is to shut down the metabolic pathway by having the final product inhibit the enzyme that catalyzes the commitment step (Figure 8.18).
7.8.0.0.4.2	Often this inhibition occurs allosterically.
7.8.0.0.4.3	When the end product is present at a high concentration, some of it binds to an allosteric site on the commitment step enzyme, thereby causing it to become inactive.
7.8.0.0.4.4	Thus the final product acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor (described earlier in this section) of the first enzyme in the pathway.
7.8.0.0.4.5	This mechanism is known as feedback inhibition or end-product inhibition.
7.8.0.0.4.6	We will describe many other examples of such inhibition in later chapters.
7.8.0.0.1.1	Many enzymes involved in signal transduction are regulated via reversible phosphorylation (see Figure 7.14A).
7.8.0.0.1.2	An enzyme can be activated by a protein kinase, which adds a phosphate from ATP  to one or more specific amino acids.
7.8.0.0.1.3	This results in a change in the shape of the enzyme, making it active.
7.8.0.0.1.4	Such activation is reversible because another enzyme called a protein phosphatase can catalyze the hydrolysis and removal of phosphate groups, so that the enzyme becomes inactive again.
7.8.0.0.1.5	In addition to the enzymes involved in signal transduction, many other enzymes and proteins in the cell (such as ion channels) are regulated via reversible phosphorylation.
7.8.0.0.1.6	Reflecting the important role of protein phosphorylation in cell functions, the human genome contains more than 500 protein kinase genes: about 2 percent of all the protein-coding genes we have.
7.8.0.0.1.1	Enzymes enable cells to perform chemical reactions and carry out complex processes rapidly without using the extremes of temperature and pH employed by chemists in the laboratory.
7.8.0.0.1.2	However, because of their three-dimensional structures and the chemistry of the side chains in their active sites, enzymes (and their substrates) are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and pH.
7.8.0.0.1.3	In Key Concept 3.2 we described the general effects of these environmental factors on proteins.
7.8.0.0.1.4	Here we will examine their effects on enzyme function (which, of course, depends on enzyme structure and chemistry).
7.8.0.0.1.1	The rates of most enzymecatalyzed reactions depend on the pH of the solution in which they occur.
7.8.0.0.1.2	While the water inside cells is generally at a neutral pH of 7, the presence of acids, bases, and buffers can alter this.
7.8.0.0.1.3	Each enzyme is most active at a particular pH; its activity decreases as the solution is made more acidic or more basic than the ideal (optimal) pH (Figure 8.19).
7.8.0.0.1.4	As an example, consider the human digestive system (see Key Concept 50.3).
7.8.0.0.1.5	The pH inside the human stomach is highly acidic, around pH 1.5.
7.8.0.0.1.6	However, many enzymes that hydrolyze macromolecules in the intestines, such as proteases, have pH optima in the neutral range.
7.8.0.0.1.7	So when food enters the small intestine, a buffer (bicarbonate) is secreted into the intestine to raise the pH to 6.5.
7.8.0.0.1.8	This allows the hydrolytic enzymes to be active and digest the food.
7.8.0.0.2.1	Figure 8.19 pH Affects Enzyme Activity
7.8.0.0.3.1	Q: Inside the cell, the pH of the cytoplasm is typically 7.2, but inside the lysosome the pH is 4.8.
7.8.0.0.3.2	A protease, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of proteins, is active within the lysosome but is inactive in the cytoplasm.
7.8.0.0.3.3	How can this occur?
7.8.0.0.4.1	An important factor in the effect of pH on enzyme function is ionization of the carboxyl, amino, and other groups on either the substrate or the enzyme.
7.8.0.0.4.2	In neutral or basic solutions, carboxyl groups (   COOH) release H+ to become negatively charged carboxylate groups (   COO   ).
7.8.0.0.4.3	However, in neutral or acidic solutions, amino groups (   NH2) accept H+ to become positively charged    NH3+ groups (see the discussion of acids and bases in Key Concept 2.4).
7.8.0.0.4.4	Thus in a neutral solution, an amino group is electrically attracted to a carboxyl group on another molecule or another part of the same molecule, because both groups are ionized and have opposite charges.
7.8.0.0.4.5	If the pH changes, however, the ionization of these groups may change.
7.8.0.0.4.6	For example, at a low pH (high H+ concentration, such as the stomach contents where the enzyme pepsin is active), the excess H+ may react with    COO    to form    COOH.
7.8.0.0.4.7	If this happens, the group is no longer negatively charged and can no longer interact with positively charged groups in the protein, so the folding of the protein may be altered.
7.8.0.0.4.8	If such a change occurs at the active site of an enzyme, the enzyme may no longer be able to bind to its substrate.
7.8.0.0.1.1	Figure 8.20 Temperature Affects Enzyme Activity
7.8.0.0.2.1	In general, warming increases the rate of a chemical reaction because a greater proportion of the reactant molecules have enough kinetic energy to provide the activation energy for the reaction.
7.8.0.0.2.2	Enzyme-catalyzed reactions are no different (Figure 8.20).
7.8.0.0.2.3	However, temperatures that are too high inactivate enzymes, because at high temperatures enzyme molecules vibrate and twist so rapidly that some of their noncovalent bonds break.
7.8.0.0.2.4	When an enzyme   s tertiary structure is changed by heat it loses its function.
7.8.0.0.2.5	Some enzymes denature at temperatures only slightly above that of the human body, but a few are stable even at the boiling point (or freezing point) of water.
7.8.0.0.2.6	All enzymes, however, have an optimal temperature for activity.
7.8.0.0.3.1	In general, enzymes adapted to warm temperatures do not denature at those temperatures, because their tertiary structures are held together largely by covalent bonds and disulfide bridges, instead of the more heat-sensitive weak chemical interactions.
7.8.0.0.3.2	Most enzymes in humans are more stable at high temperatures than are those of the bacteria that infect us, so that a moderate fever tends to denature bacterial enzymes, but not our own.
7.8.0.0.4.1	investigatinglife
7.8.0.0.5.1	How do anti-inflammatory drugs work as enzyme inhibitors?
7.8.0.0.6.1	Go into a drugstore or watch ads on TV, and it becomes obvious that there are many drugs that alleviate pain.
7.8.0.0.6.2	Like aspirin, many of them target the prostaglandin pathway for inflammation.
7.8.0.0.6.3	John Vane   s research and later work showed that aspirin irreversibly inhibits the enzyme COX.
7.8.0.0.6.4	But it turns out that there are two forms of COX, called COX-1 and COX-2, and there are several kinds of prostaglandins.
7.8.0.0.6.5	COX-1 catalyzes the production of protective prostaglandins that are involved with blood clotting (which is why people take aspirin to prevent future heart attacks due to blood clots) and the integrity of the lining of the stomach.
7.8.0.0.6.6	COX-2 catalyzes production of prostaglandins involved with inflammation and associated pain.
7.8.0.0.6.7	Aspirin inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2.
7.8.0.0.6.8	So it is not surprising that people are advised to go easy on aspirin: it may block pain, but its use can lead to stomach upsets and an inability to clot blood after a wound.
7.8.0.0.6.9	Knowledge of aspirin   s limitations has led to a search for inhibitors of COX-2 only.
7.8.0.0.6.10	Most of them are competitive inhibitors.
7.8.0.0.6.11	How would this affect how often you need to take the drug?
7.8.0.0.6.12	Look up one of these drugs and read the description of how it works.
7.8.0.0.7.1	Future directions
7.8.0.0.8.1	As details at the atomic level of the binding of enzymes to substrates are worked out, biologists use the data to try to predict which substrates might bind to which enzymes.
7.8.0.0.8.2	An important consideration in binding is    G; the less positive this parameter, the more likely binding will occur.
7.8.0.0.8.3	Factors such as ionic attractions and van der Waals forces contribute to the    G of binding.
7.8.0.0.8.4	These factors are also important in the binding of proteins to nonsubstrate molecules, including other proteins and RNA.
7.8.0.0.8.5	Indeed, it is becoming apparent that in general a protein in the cell does not exist in isolation, but is bound to something(s) else.
7.8.0.0.8.6	If the protein is an enzyme, its substrate binding must be its most preferred partner.
7.8.0.0.8.7	Understanding all the possible molecular interactions will result in a deeper understanding of what really goes on at the chemical level inside the cell.
7.8.0.0.9.1	8.5 recap
7.8.0.0.10.1	The rates of most enzyme-catalyzed reactions are affected by interacting molecules (such as inhibitors and activators) and by environmental factors (such as temperature and pH).
7.8.0.0.10.2	Reversible phosphorylation is another important mechanism for regulating enzyme activity.

7.8.0.0.16.2	How might the reactions shown in Figure 8.18A fit into a systems diagram like the one shown in Figure 8.14?
7.8.0.0.17.1	Consider an enzyme that is subject to allosteric regulation.
7.8.0.0.17.2	If a competitive inhibitor (not an allosteric inhibitor) is added to a solution containing such an enzyme, the ratio of enzyme molecules in the active form to those in the inactive form increases.
7.8.0.0.17.3	Explain this observation.
7.8.0.0.18.1	In humans, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a dangerous toxin produced as a by-product of several metabolic pathways.
7.8.0.0.18.2	The accumulation of H2O2 is prevented by its conversion to harmless H2O, a reaction catalyzed by the appropriately named enzyme catalase.
7.8.0.0.18.3	Air pollutants can inhibit this enzyme and leave individuals susceptible to tissue damage by H2O2.
7.8.0.0.18.4	How would you investigate whether catalase has an allosteric or a nonallosteric mechanism and whether the pollutants are acting as competitive or noncompetitive inhibitors?

7.8.summary.40.1	Many people enjoy watching and catching fireflies on warm summer nights, but the attraction isn   t mutual; a firefly   s primary goal is to find a mate.
7.8.summary.40.2	Male and female fireflies use specific patterns of light flashes to attract one another.
7.8.summary.40.3	The flashes are emitted from the firefly lantern, an organ located in the firefly abdomen.
7.8.summary.41.1	Light is a form of energy, which means that fireflies must divert some of their energy to produce light flashes.
7.8.summary.41.2	Researchers used a biochemical approach to learn how this is done.
7.8.summary.41.3	When the lanterns of fireflies are ground up and extracted with water, the extract briefly produces an intense light, which then fades away.
7.8.summary.41.4	If ATP is added to the extract, light is again emitted, and again, it fades.

7.8.summary.41.6	When anaerobic conditions were used, no light was observed.
7.8.summary.42.1	Through additional investigations, the researchers discovered that a compound called luciferin was responsible for the light emission as luciferin underwent a chemical reaction.

7.8.summary.46.3	This intermediate consists of luciferin covalently bonded to adenosine monophosphate (AMP).
7.8.summary.46.4	Still at the active site, this intermediate then reacts with oxygen to make an oxidized form of luciferin with the emission of light.

7.9.9.1	A Weighty Matter
7.9.10.1	With 17 percent of children and 35 percent of adults in the United States now described as obese, physicians have declared an &#8220;obesity epidemic. &#8221; Dramatic increases in diseases associated with obesity&#8211;among them diabetes, heart disease, and cancer&#8211;have understandably alarmed the medical establishment.
7.9.11.1	While nutritional science has shown that not all foods affect all people in the same ways, in most cases the significant excess body weight of obese people can be prevented or reduced if they eat less and exercise more.
7.9.11.2	It is a matter of energy: if we eat more energy-yielding molecules than we need to build our bodies and to fuel activities such as brain functions and physical activity, we will store the unneeded energy as fat.
7.9.11.3	There is an evolutionary advantage in storing fat: the energy in the C&#8211;C and C&#8211;H bonds in fat can be used later when food is scarce.
7.9.11.4	But excess fat has adverse consequences.
7.9.12.1	Not all fat (adipose) tissues are the same.
7.9.12.2	White adipose tissue (sometimes referred to simply as &#8220;white fat&#8221;) is used primarily to store energy.
7.9.13.1	Brown adipose tissue has high concentrations of mitochondria, which have iron-containing pigments.
7.9.13.2	When energy-rich molecules in brown fat are catabolized, the stored energy is released not as chemical energy but as heat.
7.9.13.3	The cells in brown fat make a protein called UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1) that inserts into the inner membranes of mitochondria, making them permeable to protons (H+).
7.9.13.4	The general impermeability of these membranes to H+ is key to coupling the catabolism of molecules such as fats to the release of their stored energy in chemical form (to make ATP).
7.9.13.5	If the membranes become permeable to H+, this coupling is lost and the stored energy is released as heat.
7.9.14.1	Human infants are born with a great deal of brown fat in their back and shoulders.
7.9.14.2	Because infants have a high surface area-to-volume ratio, they tend to lose a lot of heat.
7.9.14.3	One way they keep warm is to produce heat in their brown fat tissues.
7.9.14.4	As a child grows up, the brown fat content of the body is reduced.
7.9.14.5	Adults have mostly white fat, which has less UCP1 and generates less heat when the fat is catabolized.
7.9.14.6	But biologists recently found brown fat in adults, and its significance is gaining increasing attention.

7.9.1.4.1	An overview: Harvesting energy from glucose
7.9.1.5.1	Energy is stored in the covalent bonds of fuels, and it can be released and transformed.
7.9.1.5.2	You will recall from Chapter 8 that energy transformations can involve light, heat, chemical, mechanical, and electrical energy.
7.9.1.5.3	For example, when you burn wood, it releases a great deal of its energy as heat and light.
7.9.1.5.4	In cells, molecules used as fuels release chemical energy that is used to make ATP, which in turn drives endergonic reactions.
7.9.1.5.5	Photosynthetic cells and organisms use energy from sunlight to synthesize their own fuels, as we will describe in Chapter 10.
7.9.1.5.6	In nonphotosynthetic cells, the most common chemical fuel is the monosaccharide glucose.
7.9.1.5.7	Other molecules, including other carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, can supply energy to the whole organism.
7.9.1.5.8	However, to release their energy they must be converted into glucose or intermediate compounds that can enter into the various pathways of glucose metabolism.

7.9.1.7.1	Basic principles of chemistry govern metabolic pathways in cells.
7.9.1.8.1	Energy is transferred as electrons move from one molecule to another via an oxidation   reduction reaction.
7.9.1.9.1	Electron carrier molecules function as coenzymes to pick up or donate electrons during biological redox reactions.
7.9.1.9.2	How do cells obtain energy from glucose?
7.9.1.10.1	Cells obtain *energy from glucose by the chemical process of oxidation, which is carried out through a series of metabolic pathways.
7.9.1.10.2	As you read this chapter, keep in mind five principles that govern metabolic pathways:
7.9.1.11.1	A complex chemical transformation occurs in a series of separate reactions that form a metabolic pathway.
7.9.1.12.1	Each reaction is catalyzed by a specific enzyme.
7.9.1.13.1	Many metabolic pathways are similar in all organisms, from bacteria to humans.
7.9.1.14.1	In eukaryotes, many metabolic pathways are compartmentalized, with certain reactions occurring inside specific organelles, or even specific regions of an organelle.
7.9.1.15.1	Some key enzymes in each metabolic pathway can be inhibited or activated to alter the rate of the pathway.
7.9.1.16.1	*connect the concepts The principles of energy transformations in living and nonliving systems are discussed in Key Concept 8.1.
7.9.1.17.1	As you saw in Key Concept 2.3, the familiar process of combustion (burning) is similar to the chemical processes that release energy in cells.
7.9.1.17.2	If glucose is burned in a flame or is in a typical cell, it reacts with oxygen gas (O2), forming carbon dioxide and water and releasing energy in the form of heat.
7.9.1.17.3	The balanced equation for the complete reaction is C6H12O6 + 6 O2     6 CO2 + 6 H2O + free energy (  G =    686 kcal/mol)
7.9.1.18.1	This is an oxidation   reduction reaction (more on this shortly), in which glucose loses electrons (becomes oxidized) and oxygen gains them (becomes reduced).
7.9.1.18.2	The large standard free energy change (  G) is negative, indicating that the overall conversion is highly exergonic and can drive the endergonic formation of a lot of ATP from ADP and phosphate: ADP + Pi + free energy     ATP Figure 9.1 Energy for Life
7.9.1.19.1	The oxidation of glucose when you heat it in the lab happens all at once.
7.9.1.19.2	But in cells, glucose catabolism happens in many steps in a pathway.
7.9.1.19.3	Each step is catalyzed by an enzyme, and the process is compartmentalized.
7.9.1.19.4	Unlike combustion, glucose catabolism is tightly regulated and occurs at temperatures compatible with life.
7.9.1.20.1	Three catabolic processes harvest the energy in the chemical bonds of glucose: glycolysis, cellular respiration, and fermentation (Figure 9.1).
7.9.1.20.2	All three processes involve pathways made up of many distinct chemical reactions.
7.9.1.21.1	Glycolysis begins glucose catabolism.
7.9.1.21.2	Through a series of chemical rearrangements, glucose is converted to two molecules of the three-carbon product pyruvate, and a small amount of energy is captured in usable forms.
7.9.1.21.3	Glycolysis is an anaerobic process because it does not require O2.
7.9.1.22.1	Cellular respiration uses O2 from the environment and thus is aerobic.
7.9.1.22.2	Each pyruvate molecule is completely converted into three molecules of CO2 through a set of catabolic pathways including pyruvate oxidation, the citric acid cycle, and an electron transport system (the respiratory chain).
7.9.1.22.3	In the process, a great deal of the energy stored in the covalent bonds of pyruvate is captured to form ATP.
7.9.1.23.1	Fermentation does not involve O2 (it is anaerobic).
7.9.1.23.2	With the exception of many microorganisms, fermentation converts pyruvate into lactic acid or ethyl alcohol (ethanol), both of which are still relatively energy-rich molecules.
7.9.1.23.3	Because the breakdown of glucose is incomplete, much less energy is released when glycolysis is coupled to fermentation than when it is coupled to cellular respiration.
7.9.1.2.1.1	As you saw in Key Concept 8.2, the addition of a phosphate group to ADP to make ATP is an endergonic reaction (see Figure 8.6).
7.9.1.2.1.2	It is achieved by coupling an exergonic reaction to ATP production: the energy released in the exergonic reaction is used to drive ATP synthesis.
7.9.1.2.1.3	Electrons are transferred in the exergonic reaction.
7.9.1.2.1.4	A reaction in which one substance transfers one or more electrons to another substance is called an oxidation   reduction, or redox, reaction.
7.9.1.2.2.1	Reduction is the gain of one or more electrons by an atom, ion, or molecule.
7.9.1.2.3.1	Oxidation is the loss of one or more electrons.
7.9.1.2.4.1	Oxidation and reduction always occur together: as one chemical is oxidized, the electrons it loses are transferred to another chemical, reducing it.
7.9.1.2.4.2	In a redox reaction, we call the reactant that becomes reduced an oxidizing agent and the one that becomes oxidized a reducing agent:
7.9.1.2.5.1	In the metabolism of glucose:
7.9.1.2.6.1	Glucose is the reducing agent (electron donor).
7.9.1.2.7.1	O2 is the oxidizing agent (electron acceptor).
7.9.1.2.8.1	Although oxidation and reduction are always defined in terms of electrons, it is often simpler to think in terms of the gain or loss of hydrogen atoms.
7.9.1.2.8.2	The transfer of electrons is often associated with the transfer of hydrogen ions (a H atom contains H+ + e   ).
7.9.1.2.8.3	So when a molecule loses hydrogen atoms, it becomes oxidized.
7.9.1.2.8.4	Figure 9.2 Oxidation, Reduction, and Energy
7.9.1.2.9.1	The more reduced a molecule is, the more energy is stored in its covalent bonds (Figure 9.2).
7.9.1.2.9.2	In a redox reaction, some energy is transferred from the reducing agent to the reduced product.
7.9.1.2.9.3	The rest remains in the reducing agent or is lost to entropy.
7.9.1.2.9.4	As you will see, some of the key reactions of glycolysis and cellular respiration are highly exergonic redox reactions.
7.9.1.3.1.1	The *coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) acts as an electron carrier in redox reactions.
7.9.1.3.1.2	Note the flow of electrons along the blue lines below:
7.9.1.3.2.1	*connect the concepts Key Concept 8.4 describes the role of coenzymes, small molecules that assist in enzyme-catalyzed reactions.
7.9.1.3.2.2	ADP acts as a coenzyme when it picks up energy released in an exergonic reaction and packages it to form ATP.
7.9.1.3.3.1	As you can see, NAD+ exists in two chemically distinct forms, one oxidized (NAD+) and the other reduced (NADH) (Focus: Key Figure 9.3).
7.9.1.3.3.2	Both forms participate in redox reactions.
7.9.1.3.3.3	The reduction reaction
7.9.1.3.4.1	is actually the transfer of a proton (the hydrogen ion, H+) and two electrons, which are released by the accompanying oxidization reaction.
7.9.1.3.5.1	focus: Key figure
7.9.1.3.6.1	Figure 9.3 NAD+/NADH Is an Electron Carrier in Redox Reactions
7.9.1.3.7.1	NAD+ is an important electron acceptor in redox reactions, and thus its reduced form, NADH, is an important energy intermediary in cells.
7.9.1.3.7.2	Most of the molecule (left) remains unchanged by the redox reaction.
7.9.1.3.8.1	Q: Where does the &#8220;H&#8221; in red come from when NAD is reduced?
7.9.1.3.9.1	The electrons do not remain with the coenzyme.
7.9.1.3.9.2	Oxygen is highly electronegative and readily accepts electrons from NADH.
7.9.1.3.9.3	The oxidation of NADH by O2 (which occurs in several steps)
7.9.1.3.10.1	is exergonic, with a standard free energy change at pH 7 (  G  ) of    52.4 kcal/mol (   219 kJ/mol).
7.9.1.3.10.2	Note that the oxidizing agent appears here as       O2  ? instead of    O.  ?
7.9.1.3.10.3	This notation emphasizes that it is molecular oxygen, O2, that acts as the oxidizing agent.
7.9.1.3.11.1	Just as ATP can be thought of as a package of 7.3 kcal/mol (30.5 kJ/mol) of free energy, NADH can be thought of as a larger package of free energy (52.4 kcal/mol; see above).
7.9.1.3.11.2	NAD+ is a common electron carrier in cells, but not the only one.
7.9.1.3.11.3	Another carrier, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), also transfers electrons during glucose metabolism.
7.9.1.4.1.1	Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells can harvest energy from glucose using different combinations of the following metabolic pathways:
7.9.1.4.2.1	Under aerobic conditions, when O2 is available as the final electron acceptor, four pathways operate (Figure 9.4A).
7.9.1.4.2.2	Glycolysis is followed by the three pathways of cellular respiration: pyruvate oxidation, the citric acid cycle (also called the Krebs cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle), and electron transport/ATP synthesis (also called oxidative phosphorylation).
7.9.1.4.3.1	In eukaryotes and many prokaryotes, pyruvate oxidation, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation do not function under anaerobic conditions.
7.9.1.4.3.2	The pyruvate produced by glycolysis is further metabolized by fermentation (Figure 9.4B).
7.9.1.4.3.3	Some prokaryotes, however, are able to harvest energy in pathways involving oxidative phosphorylation even in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic respiration; see Key Concept 9.3). table 9.1 Cellular Locations for Major Energy Pathways in Eukaryotes and Prokaryote Eukaryotes Prokaryotes In cytoplasm Glycolysis Fermentation In cytoplasm Glycolysis Fermentation Citric acid cycle Inside mitochondrion Matrix Citric acid cycle Pyruvate oxidation On cell membrane Pyruvate oxidation Respiratory chain Inner membrane Respiratory chain
7.9.1.4.4.1	The five pathways shown in Figure 9.4 occur in different locations in the cell (Table 9.1).
7.9.1.4.5.1	Figure 9.4 Energy-Yielding Metabolic Pathways
7.9.1.4.6.1	Energy-yielding reactions can be grouped into five metabolic pathways: glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, the citric acid cycle, the respiratory chain/ATP synthesis, and fermentation.
7.9.1.4.6.2	(A) The three lower pathways occur only in the presence of O2 and are collectively referred to as cellular respiration.
7.9.1.4.6.3	(B) When O2 is unavailable, glycolysis is followed by fermentation.
7.9.1.4.7.1	9.1 recap
7.9.1.4.8.1	The free energy released from the oxidation of glucose is trapped in the form of ATP.
7.9.1.4.8.2	In many prokaryotes and all eukaryotes, five major pathways combine in different ways to produce ATP, which supplies the energy for myriad other reactions in living cells.

7.9.2.4.1	Pyruvate oxidation and the citric acid cycle are regulated by the concentrations of starting materials Figure 9.5 Glycolysis Converts Glucose into Pyruvate
7.9.2.5.1	The aerobic pathways of glucose catabolism oxidize glucose completely to CO2 and H2O.
7.9.2.5.2	Initially, the glycolysis reactions convert the six-carbon glucose molecule to two three-carbon pyruvate molecules (Figure 9.5).
7.9.2.5.3	Pyruvate is then converted to CO2 in a second series of reactions beginning with pyruvate oxidation and followed by the citric acid cycle.
7.9.2.5.4	In addition to generating CO2, the oxidation events are coupled with the reduction of electron carriers, mostly NAD+.
7.9.2.6.1	focus your learning
7.9.2.7.1	Glucose is partially oxidized to pyruvate during glycolysis.
7.9.2.8.1	The generation of acetyl coenzyme A by pyruvate oxidation enables the entry of carbon from glucose into the citric acid cycle for further oxidation.
7.9.2.9.1	A large amount of energy is captured in electron carriers and in GTP as acetyl CoA is fully oxidized during the citric acid cycle.
7.9.2.10.1	We will begin our consideration of the catabolism of glucose with a closer look at glycolysis.
7.9.2.5.1.1	Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm and involves ten enzyme-catalyzed reactions.
7.9.2.5.1.2	During glycolysis, some of the covalent bonds between carbon and hydrogen atoms in the glucose molecule are oxidized, releasing some of the stored energy.
7.9.2.5.1.3	The products are two molecules of pyruvate (pyruvic acid), two molecules of ATP, and two molecules of NADH.
7.9.2.5.1.4	Glycolysis can be divided into two stages: the initial energy-investing reactions that consume ATP, and the energy-harvesting reactions that produce ATP and NADH (see Figure 9.5).
7.9.2.5.2.1	To help you understand the process without getting into extensive detail, we will focus on two consecutive reactions in this pathway (Steps 6 and 7 in Figure 9.5).
7.9.2.5.3.1	Steps 6 and 7 are examples of two types of reactions that occur repeatedly in glycolysis and in many other metabolic pathways:
7.9.2.5.4.1	Oxidation   reduction: The first reaction is exergonic   more than 50 kcal/mol of energy are released in the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
7.9.2.5.4.2	(Look at the bottom carbon atom, where an H is replaced by an O.)
7.9.2.5.4.3	The energy is trapped via the reduction of NAD+ to NADH.
7.9.2.5.5.1	Substrate-level phosphorylation: The second reaction in this series is also exergonic, but in this case less energy is released, sufficient to transfer a phosphate directly from the substrate to ADP, forming ATP.
7.9.2.5.6.1	The end product of glycolysis, pyruvate, is somewhat more oxidized than glucose.
7.9.2.5.6.2	In the presence of O2, further oxidation can occur.
7.9.2.5.6.3	In prokaryotes these subsequent reactions take place in the cytoplasm, but in eukaryotes they take place in the mitochondrial matrix.
7.9.2.5.7.1	To summarize:
7.9.2.5.8.1	The initial steps of glycolysis use the energy of hydrolysis of two ATP molecules per glucose molecule.
7.9.2.5.9.1	The remaining steps produce four ATP molecules per glucose molecule, so the net production of ATP is two molecules.
7.9.2.5.10.1	Glycolysis produces two molecules of NADH.
7.9.2.5.11.1	If O2 is present, glycolysis is followed by the three stages of cellular respiration: pyruvate oxidation, the citric acid cycle, and the respiratory chain/ATP synthesis.
7.9.2.6.1.1	In eukaryotes, pyruvate is transported into the mitochondrial matrix (see Figure 5.11), where the next step in the aerobic catabolism of glucose occurs.
7.9.2.6.1.2	This step involves the oxidation of pyruvate to a two-carbon acetate molecule and CO2.
7.9.2.6.1.3	The acetate is then bound to coenzyme A to form acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA); CoA is used in various biochemical reactions as a carrier of the acetyl group (H3C   C=O).
7.9.2.6.2.1	Pyruvate is the link between glycolysis and further oxidative reactions (see Figure 9.4).
7.9.2.6.3.1	The formation of acetyl CoA is a multistep reaction catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which contains 60 individual proteins and 5 different coenzymes.
7.9.2.6.3.2	The overall reaction is exergonic, in which one molecule of NAD+ is reduced to NADH.
7.9.2.6.3.3	However, the main role of acetyl CoA is to donate its acetyl group to the four-carbon compound oxaloacetate, forming the six-carbon molecule citrate.
7.9.2.6.3.4	This initiates the citric acid cycle, one of life   s most important energy-harvesting pathways.
7.9.2.7.1.1	Acetyl CoA is the starting point for the citric acid cycle.
7.9.2.7.1.2	This pathway of eight reactions completely oxidizes the two-carbon acetyl group to two molecules of CO2.
7.9.2.7.1.3	The free energy released from these reactions is captured by GDP (guanosine diphosphate) and the electron carriers NAD+ and FAD (Figure 9.6).
7.9.2.7.1.4	(Remember from Key Concept 7.2 that GDP is a nucleoside diphosphate like ADP.)
7.9.2.7.1.5	This is a cycle because the starting material, oxaloacetate, is regenerated in the last step and is ready to accept another acetate group from acetyl CoA.
7.9.2.7.1.6	The citric acid cycle operates twice for each glucose molecule that enters glycolysis (once for each pyruvate that enters the mitochondrion).
7.9.2.7.2.1	Figure 9.6 The Citric Acid Cycle
7.9.2.7.3.1	The citric acid cycle has eight steps; in the last step, the starting material acceptor, oxaloacetate, is regenerated.
7.9.2.7.3.2	Energy is released and captured by reducing NAD+ or FAD, or by producing GTP. &#8220;6C,&#8221; &#8220;5C,&#8221; and so on indicate the number of carbon atoms in each intermediate in the cycle.
7.9.2.7.4.1	Let   s focus on the final reaction of the cycle (Step 8 in Figure 9.6), as an example of the kind of reaction that occurs:
7.9.2.7.5.1	This oxidation reaction (see the carbon atom highlighted in blue) is exergonic, and the released energy is trapped by NAD+, forming NADH.
7.9.2.7.5.2	With four such reactions (the FADH2 produced in Step 6 is a reduced coenzyme similar to NADH), the citric acid cycle harvests a great deal of chemical energy from the oxidation of acetyl CoA.
7.9.2.7.6.1	To summarize:
7.9.2.7.7.1	The inputs to the citric acid cycle are acetate (in the form of acetyl CoA), water, GDP, and the oxidized electron carriers NAD+ and FAD.
7.9.2.7.8.1	The outputs are carbon dioxide, reduced electron carriers (NADH and FADH2), and a small amount of GTP.
7.9.2.7.8.2	The energy in the terminal phosphate of GTP is transferred to ATP: GTP + ADP     ATP + GDP
7.9.2.7.9.1	Thus the citric acid cycle releases two carbons as CO2 and produces four reduced electron carrier molecules.
7.9.2.7.10.1	Overall, for each molecule of glucose that is oxidized, two molecules of pyruvate are produced during glycolysis, and after oxidation these feed two turns of the citric acid cycle.
7.9.2.7.10.2	So the oxidation of one glucose molecule yields:
7.9.2.7.11.1	Six CO2
7.9.2.7.12.1	Ten NADH (two in glycolysis, two in pyruvate oxidation, and six in the citric acid cycle)
7.9.2.7.13.1	Two FADH2
7.9.2.7.14.1	Four ATP
7.9.2.8.1.1	You have now seen that pyruvate, a three-carbon molecule, is completely oxidized to CO2 by pyruvate dehydrogenase and the citric acid cycle.
7.9.2.8.1.2	For the cycle to continue, the starting molecules   acetyl CoA and oxidized electron carriers   must all be replenished.
7.9.2.8.1.3	The electron carriers are reduced during the citric acid cycle and in Step 6 of glycolysis (see Figure 9.5), and they must be reoxidized: NADH     NAD+ + H+ + 2 e FADH2     FAD + 2 H+ + 2 e
7.9.2.8.2.1	These oxidation reactions are coupled to reactions in which other molecules get reduced.
7.9.2.8.2.2	When it is present, O2 is the molecule that eventually accepts these electrons, and it is reduced to form H2O.
7.9.2.8.3.1	9.2 recap
7.9.2.8.4.1	The oxidation of glucose in the presence of O2 involves glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, and the citric acid cycle.
7.9.2.8.4.2	In glycolysis, glucose is converted to pyruvate with some energy capture.
7.9.2.8.4.3	Pyruvate is oxidized first to acetyl CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase, then completely to CO2 by the citric acid cycle, releasing energy that is captured in the form of reduced electron carriers.
7.9.2.8.5.1	learning outcomes
7.9.2.8.6.1	You should be able to:
7.9.2.8.7.1	Describe the energy inputs and outputs of glycolysis.
7.9.2.8.8.1	Explain how pyruvate oxidation connects the transformations of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.
7.9.2.8.9.1	Compare and contrast glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.
7.9.2.8.10.1	What is the net energy yield of glycolysis in terms of energy in ATP and reduced coenzymes invested and energy harvested?
7.9.2.8.11.1	What role does pyruvate oxidation play in relation to the citric acid cycle?
7.9.2.8.12.1	How is the citric acid cycle a    cycle  ? but glycolysis is not?
7.9.2.8.13.1	Pyruvate oxidation and the citric acid cycle cannot continue operating unless O2 is available to receive electrons during the reoxidation of reduced electron carriers.
7.9.2.8.13.2	However, these electrons are not passed directly to O2, as you will learn next.

7.9.3.7.1	How ATP Synthase Works: A Molecular Motor
7.9.3.8.1	Some microorganisms use non-O2 electron acceptors
7.9.3.9.1	In the presence of O2, oxidative phosphorylation is a process of ATP synthesis resulting from the reoxidation of electron carriers in the presence of O2.
7.9.3.9.2	In this section we describe oxidative phosphorylation as it occurs in mitochondria, but the same process occurs in prokaryotes (see Table 9.1).
7.9.3.10.1	focus your learning
7.9.3.11.1	Chemiosmosis converts the potential energy of a proton concentration gradient to chemical energy in ATP.
7.9.3.12.1	Experimental results demonstrated the relationship between a proton gradient across a membrane and ATP synthesis.
7.9.3.1.1.1	Two components of the process can be distinguished:
7.9.3.1.2.1	Electron transport.
7.9.3.1.2.2	The electrons from NADH and FADH2 pass through the respiratory chain, a series of membrane-associated electron carriers.
7.9.3.1.2.3	The flow of electrons along this pathway results in the active transport of protons out of the mitochondrial matrix and across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating a proton concentration gradient.
7.9.3.1.3.1	Chemiosmosis.
7.9.3.1.3.2	The protons diffuse back into the mitochondrial matrix through a channel protein, ATP synthase, which couples this diffusion to the synthesis of ATP.
7.9.3.1.3.3	As we mentioned in the chapter opening, the inner mitochondrial membrane is normally impermeable to protons, so the only way for them to follow their concentration gradient is through the channel.
7.9.3.1.4.1	Before we proceed with the details of these pathways, let   s consider an important question: Why should the respiratory chain be such a complex process?
7.9.3.1.4.2	Why don   t cells use the following single step? 2 NADH + 2 H+ + O2     2 NAD+ + 2 H2O
7.9.3.1.5.1	The answer is that this reaction would simply release too much energy to be efficiently trapped to make ATP.
7.9.3.1.5.2	Oxidizing NADH to NAD+ is extremely exergonic   doing it in one step would be like setting off a stick of dynamite in the cell.
7.9.3.1.5.3	There is no biochemical way to harvest that burst of energy efficiently and put it to physiological use (that is, no single metabolic reaction is so endergonic as to consume a significant fraction of that energy in a single step).
7.9.3.1.5.4	To control the release of energy during the oxidation of glucose, cells have evolved a lengthy respiratory chain: a series of reactions, each of which releases a small amount of energy, one step at a time.
7.9.3.2.1.1	The respiratory chain is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane.
7.9.3.2.1.2	Because of the extensive folding of the membrane, there is more room for the proteins involved in the chain than there would be in a membrane with less surface area.
7.9.3.2.1.3	There are several interacting components, including large integral proteins, a small peripheral protein, and a small lipid molecule.
7.9.3.2.1.4	Figure 9.7 shows a plot of the free energy released as electrons are passed between the carriers.
7.9.3.2.2.1	Figure 9.7 The Oxidation of NADH and FADH2 in the Respiratory Chain
7.9.3.2.3.1	Electrons from NADH and FADH2 are passed along the respiratory chain, a series of protein complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane containing electron carriers and enzymes.
7.9.3.2.3.2	The carriers gain free energy when they become reduced and release free energy when they are oxidized.
7.9.3.2.3.3	This illustration shows the standard free energy changes along the respiratory chain.
7.9.3.2.4.1	Q: What is the   G for the transfer of electrons from cytochrome c to O2?
7.9.3.2.5.1	Four large protein complexes (I, II, III, and IV) contain electron carriers and associated enzymes.
7.9.3.2.5.2	In eukaryotes they are integral proteins of the inner mitochondrial membrane (see Figure 5.11), and three are transmembrane proteins.
7.9.3.2.6.1	Cytochrome c is a small peripheral protein that lies in the intermembrane space.
7.9.3.2.6.2	It is loosely attached to the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane.
7.9.3.2.7.1	Ubiquinone (often referred to as coenzyme Q10; abbreviated Q) is a small, nonpolar, lipid molecule that moves freely within the hydrophobic interior of the phospholipid bilayer of the inner mitochondrial membrane.
7.9.3.2.8.1	As illustrated in Figure 9.7, NADH passes electrons to protein complex I (called NADH-Q reductase), which in turn passes the electrons to Q. This electron transfer is accompanied by a large drop in free energy.
7.9.3.2.8.2	Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) passes electrons to Q from FADH2, which was generated in Step 6 of the citric acid cycle (see Figure 9.6).
7.9.3.2.8.3	These electrons enter the chain later than those from NADH and will ultimately produce less ATP.
7.9.3.2.9.1	Complex III (cytochrome c reductase) receives electrons from Q and passes them to cytochrome c. Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) receives electrons from cytochrome c and passes them to oxygen.
7.9.3.2.9.2	Finally the reduction of oxygen to H2O occurs: O2 + 4 H+ + 4 e        2 H2O
7.9.3.2.10.1	Notice that four protons (H+) are also consumed in this reaction.
7.9.3.2.10.2	This contributes to the proton concentration gradient across the inner  mitochondrial membrane by reducing the proton concentration in the mitochondrial matrix.
7.9.3.3.1.1	During electron transport, protons are also actively transported across the membrane: electron transport within each of the three transmembrane complexes (I, III, and IV) results in the transfer of protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space (Figure 9.8).
7.9.3.3.1.2	Since the lipid bilayer does not allow charged H+ to diffuse across it, transfer of H+ across it through the electron transport chain sets up a gradient, with the concentration of H+ in the intermembrane space higher than in the matrix.
7.9.3.3.1.3	In addition, because H+ carries a charge, there is more positive charge in the intermembrane space.
7.9.3.3.1.4	These two gradients   of concentration and charge   set up a proton-motive force which is a key factor in energy metabolism in cells: The gradient of H+ across the inner membrane is a source of potential energy.
7.9.3.3.2.1	Figure 9.8 The Respiratory Chain and ATP Synthase Produce ATP by a Chemiosmotic Mechanism
7.9.3.3.3.1	As electrons pass through the transmembrane protein complexes in the respiratory chain, protons are transferred from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space.
7.9.3.3.3.2	As the protons return to the matrix through ATP synthase, ATP is formed.
7.9.3.3.4.1	How can this energy be tapped for use by the cell?
7.9.3.3.4.2	The answer is that another protein, ATP synthase, allows the H+ to diffuse back into the matrix down its concentration gradient.
7.9.3.3.4.3	In the process, potential energy is captured and used for the formation of ATP.
7.9.3.3.4.4	The coupling of the proton-motive force and ATP synthesis is called the chemiosmotic mechanism   or chemiosmosis   and is found in all respiring cells.
7.9.3.3.5.1	To summarize, the energy originally contained in glucose and other fuel molecules is ultimately captured in the cellular energy currency, ATP.
7.9.3.3.5.2	For each pair of electrons passed along the chain from NADH to oxygen, about 2.5 molecules of ATP are formed.
7.9.3.3.5.3	FADH2 oxidation produces about 1.5 ATP molecules because it enters the electron transport chain at a later step than NADH (see Figure 9.8).
7.9.3.3.6.1	ATP synthesis is a reversible reaction, and ATP synthase can also act as an ATPase, hydrolyzing ATP to ADP and Pi: ATP &#8651; ADP + Pi + free energy
7.9.3.3.7.1	If the reaction goes to the right, free energy is released.
7.9.3.3.7.2	In the mitochondrion, it is used to transfer H+ out of the mitochondrial matrix   not the usual mode of operation.
7.9.3.3.7.3	If the reaction goes to the left, it uses the free energy from H+ diffusion into the matrix to make ATP.
7.9.3.3.7.4	What makes it prefer ATP synthesis?
7.9.3.3.7.5	There are two answers to this question:
7.9.3.3.8.1	ATP leaves the mitochondrial matrix for use elsewhere in the cell as soon as it is made, keeping the ATP concentration in the matrix low, and driving the reaction toward the left.
7.9.3.3.9.1	The H+ gradient is maintained by electron and proton transport.
7.9.3.3.10.1	Every day a person hydrolyzes about 1025 ATP molecules to ADP.
7.9.3.3.10.2	This amounts to 9 kg, a significant fraction of the person   s entire body weight!
7.9.3.3.10.3	The vast majority of this ADP is    recycled  ?   converted back to ATP   using free energy from the oxidation of glucose.
7.9.3.4.1.1	Because it is so important, chemiosmosis has been subjected to many lab experiments.
7.9.3.4.1.2	Let   s look at two lines of evidence; first, a direct demonstration in the lab that a H+ gradient can drive ATP synthesis, and second, natural disruption of the coupling of electron transport to ATP synthesis.
7.9.3.4.2.1	experiment

7.9.3.4.5.1	The chemiosmosis hypothesis was a bold departure from the conventional scientific thinking of the time.
7.9.3.4.5.2	It required an intact compartment enclosed by a membrane.
7.9.3.4.5.3	Could a proton gradient drive the synthesis of ATP?
7.9.3.4.5.4	The first experiments to answer this question used chloroplasts, plant organelles that use the same mechanism as mitochondria to synthesize ATP.
7.9.3.4.6.1	HYPOTHESIS  A H+ gradient across a membrane that contains ATP synthase is sufficient to drive ATP synthesis.
7.9.3.4.7.1	METHOD
7.9.3.4.8.1	CONCLUSION   A H+ gradient across an ATP synthase   containing membrane is sufficient for ATP synthesis by organelles.
7.9.3.4.9.1	A work with the data exercise that accompanies this figure may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.9.0.0.1.1	The key experiment that demonstrated that a proton (H+) gradient across a membrane could drive ATP synthesis was first performed using chloroplasts, the organelles in plants that convert the energy in sunlight into chemical energy (photosynthesis; see Chapter 10) (Figure 9.9).
7.9.0.0.1.2	Soon thereafter, the same mechanism was shown to work in mitochondria.
7.9.0.0.1.1	As you have seen, the coupling of electron transport (which generates the proton gradient) with chemiosmosis is vital for the capture of free energy in the form of ATP.
7.9.0.0.1.2	Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which is found in the mitochondria of brown fat cells (described in the chapter opening), demonstrates the importance of this coupling.
7.9.0.0.1.3	By disrupting the gradient, UCP1 allows the energy released during electron transport to be in the form of heat, rather than chemical energy trapped in ATP.
7.9.0.0.2.1	The relationship between UCP1 in brown fat and body weight has been investigated experimentally in a study of a genetic strain of mice that   unlike normal mice   do not get fat as they age (people tend to put on weight as they age too).
7.9.0.0.2.2	As Investigating Life: Mitochondria, Genetics, and Obesity reveals, it appears that the leaner mice make more UCP1 and burn off more fat than normal mice do.
7.9.0.0.2.3	Might this observation point to ways to control weight gain in people?
7.9.0.0.2.4	In a related study of obesity conducted in the 1930s, a chemical, dinitrophenol, was shown to uncouple oxidation and phosphorylation, just as UCP1 (which had not been discovered yet) does.
7.9.0.0.2.5	Physicians got the idea that giving obese people the uncoupler would cause them to oxidize (burn off) their fat.
7.9.0.0.2.6	It worked, but since dinitrophenol acted on all mitochondria everywhere in the body, and not just in fat cells, severe side effects occurred as ATP production all over the body became critically low   in some cases too low for survival.
7.9.0.0.2.7	So the idea of an uncoupler for weight loss was dropped.
7.9.0.0.1.1	Now that we have established that the H+ gradient is needed for ATP synthesis, a question remains: How does the enzyme ATP synthase actually make ATP from ADP and Pi?
7.9.0.0.1.2	This is certainly a fundamental question in biology, as it underlies energy harvesting in most cells.
7.9.0.0.1.3	The structure and mechanism of ATP synthase, illustrated in Figure 9.10A, are shared by living organisms as diverse as bacteria and humans.
7.9.0.0.1.4	ATP synthase is a molecular motor composed of two parts: the F0 unit, a transmembrane region that is the H+ channel; and the F1 unit, which contains the active sites for ATP synthesis.
7.9.0.0.1.5	F1 consists of six subunits (three each of two polypeptide chains), arranged like the segments of an orange around a central shaftlike polypeptide that interacts with the membrane-embedded F0.
7.9.0.0.1.6	Electron transport sets up an H+ gradient across the membrane.
7.9.0.0.1.7	This gradient has potential energy, and when H+ diffuses through the channel, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, causing the central polypeptide to rotate.
7.9.0.0.1.8	The energy is transmitted to the catalytic subunits of F1, resulting in ATP synthesis.
7.9.0.0.1.9	These molecular motors make ATP at rates up to 100 molecules per second.

7.9.0.0.8.1	As people (and mice) get older, they tend to accumulate fat.
7.9.0.0.8.2	In the course of investigating a strain of mice genetically unable to make the receptor for a hormone called ghrelin that is involved in controlling appetite, Yuxiang Sun and her team at Baylor College of Medicine compared these mice with normal mice as they aged.
7.9.0.0.8.3	They were surprised to find that the genetically changed mice did not put on as much weight as their normal counterparts.
7.9.0.0.8.4	The researchers discovered that the genetic mutation in these mice caused uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and burning of body fat.
7.9.0.0.8.5	Their experiment investigated whether levels of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) were different in the genetically changed mice than in normal mice.

7.9.0.0.10.1	CONCLUSION  Increased UCP1 correlates with less fat and a lower body weight.
7.9.0.0.11.1	work with the data
7.9.0.0.12.1	In an effort to determine whether weight gain in normal mice might be due to inactivity or to eating too much (two of the well-known causes of weight gain), as opposed to a biochemical abnormality (such as unusual UCP1 levels), Sun and her team examined young (3   4 months old) and older (10   12 months old) mice of both strains.
7.9.0.0.12.2	They measured weight and body composition in terms of fat and lean body tissues.
7.9.0.0.12.3	The results are shown in Figure A.
7.9.0.0.13.1	QUESTIONS
7.9.0.0.14.1	Did the mutant mice and normal mice gain weight as they aged?
7.9.0.0.15.1	The researchers wondered whether the weight changes noted in Figure 1 were due to changes in eating patterns or exercising.
7.9.0.0.15.2	So they measured how much food the mice ate per day and measured their movements over time in a special chamber.
7.9.0.0.15.3	The results are shown in Figure B. What can you conclude about the role of food intake and exercise on the weight differences between the two strains of mice?
7.9.0.0.16.1	The uncoupling protein UCP1 found in the inner mitochondrial membrane of brown fat cells uncouples mitochondrial electron transport (oxidation) and ATP production (phosphorylation), so that instead of being trapped as chemical energy in the formation of ATP, the energy released by oxidation is released as heat.
7.9.0.0.16.2	Sun and her team measured UCP1 levels in brown fat mitochondria of the two strains of mice.
7.9.0.0.16.3	The results are shown in Figure C. What can you conclude about the role of UCP1 in the weight differences between the two strains of mice?
7.9.0.0.17.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.9.0.0.18.1	An ingenious experiment confirmed this rotary motor mechanism.
7.9.0.0.18.2	Masasuke Yoshida and his colleagues at the Tokyo Institute of Technology isolated the F1 portion of the ATP synthase and attached it to a glass slide.
7.9.0.0.18.3	Fluorescently labeled microfilaments were attached to the central peptide, and the slide was incubated in a solution containing ATP.
7.9.0.0.18.4	In this case there was no proton gradient to drive the molecular motor in the direction of ATP synthesis.
7.9.0.0.18.5	Instead, ATP was hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi, and this energy caused the motor to spin.
7.9.0.0.18.6	Rotation of the labeled microfilament was visible under a microscope, with the labeled filaments clearly rotating like propellers.
7.9.0.5.1.1	A more general way to describe the last reaction in electron transport (Equation 9.1, above) is: Xoxidized + e        Xreduced
7.9.0.5.2.1	Part of the amazing success of bacteria and archaea is that they have evolved biochemical pathways that allow them to exist in environments where O2 is scarce or absent.
7.9.0.5.2.2	As you will see in the next section, for most animals and plants, the anaerobic (no O2) catabolism of glucose generally yields much less energy than aerobic catabolism.
7.9.0.5.2.3	However, many bacteria and archaea exploit their environments to use *alternative electron acceptors.
7.9.0.5.2.4	This allows them to complete the electron transport chain and produce ATP even in the absence of O2.
7.9.0.5.2.5	Table 9.2 summarizes some of these pathways, which are referred to as anaerobic respiration.
7.9.0.5.2.6	Note that some of these microbes use ions as electron acceptors while others use small molecules.

7.9.0.5.4.1	9.3 recap
7.9.0.5.5.1	The oxidation of reduced electron carriers in the respiratory chain drives the active transport of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, generating a proton-motive force.
7.9.0.5.5.2	Diffusion of protons down their electrochemical gradient through ATP synthase is coupled to the synthesis of ATP.
7.9.0.5.5.3	Electron transport can form toxic intermediates.

7.9.0.5.12.1	Trace the sequence of changes in redox reactions that occur in mammalian tissue when the oxygen supply is cut off.
7.9.0.5.12.2	The first change is that all of the cytochrome c becomes reduced, because electrons can still flow from cytochrome c, but there is no oxygen to accept electrons from cytochrome c oxidase.
7.9.0.5.12.3	What happens after this?
7.9.0.5.13.1	The drug antimycin A blocks electron transport in mitochondria and chloroplasts.
7.9.0.5.13.2	Explain what would happen if the experiment in Figure 9.9 were repeated in the presence of this drug.
7.9.0.5.14.1	Oxidative phosphorylation captures a great deal of energy in ATP.
7.9.0.5.14.2	But it does not occur if O2 is absent.
7.9.0.5.14.3	We will turn now to the metabolism of glucose in anaerobic conditions.
7.9.0.5.15.1	Chapter 9 continues with
7.9.0.5.16.1	9.4  In the Absence of Oxygen, Some Energy Is Harvested from Glucose
7.9.4.1.1	Cellular respiration yields much more energy than fermentation
7.9.4.2.1	The yield of ATP is reduced by the impermeability of mitochondria to NADH
7.9.4.3.1	In eukaryotes, in the absence of O2 (anaerobic conditions), a small amount of ATP can be produced by glycolysis and fermentation.
7.9.4.3.2	Like glycolysis, fermentation pathways occur in the cytoplasm.
7.9.4.3.3	There are many different types of fermentation, but they all operate to regenerate NAD+ so that the NAD+-requiring reactions of glycolysis can continue.
7.9.4.3.4	The two best-understood fermentation pathways are found in a wide variety of organisms, including eukaryotes:
7.9.4.4.1	Lactic acid fermentation, the end product of which is lactic acid (lactate)
7.9.4.5.1	Alcoholic fermentation, the end product of which is ethyl alcohol (ethanol)
7.9.4.6.1	focus your learning
7.9.4.7.1	Lactic acid fermentation and alcoholic fermentation are pathways that allow glucose to be oxidized in the absence of oxygen by regenerating oxidized electron carriers.
7.9.4.7.2	Figure 9.11  Fermentation
7.9.4.8.1	In lactic acid fermentation, pyruvate serves as the electron acceptor and lactate is the product (Figure 9.11A).
7.9.4.8.2	This process takes place in many microorganisms and complex organisms, including higher plants and vertebrates.
7.9.4.8.3	A notable example of lactic acid fermentation occurs in vertebrate muscle tissue.
7.9.4.8.4	Usually, vertebrates get their energy for muscle contraction aerobically, with the circulatory system supplying O2 to muscles.
7.9.4.8.5	In small vertebrates, this is almost always adequate: for example, birds can fly long distances without resting.
7.9.4.8.6	But in larger vertebrates such as humans, the circulatory system is not up to the task of delivering enough O2 when the need is great, such as during intense activity.
7.9.4.8.7	At this point, the muscle cells break down glycogen (a stored polysaccharide; see Figure 3.18) and undergo lactic acid fermentation.
7.9.4.9.1	Lactate buildup becomes a problem after prolonged periods of intense exercise because it is associated with an increase in the H+ concentration in the cell, lowering the pH.
7.9.4.9.2	This affects cellular activities, which return to normal upon resting.
7.9.4.9.3	Lactate dehydrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the fermentation reaction, works in both directions.
7.9.4.9.4	That is, when O2 is available it can catalyze the oxidation of lactate to form pyruvate, which is then catabolized to CO2 with concomitant energy release to form ATP.
7.9.4.9.5	When lactate levels are decreased, muscle activity can resume.
7.9.4.10.1	Alcoholic fermentation takes place in certain yeasts (eukaryotic microbes) and some plant cells under anaerobic conditions.
7.9.4.10.2	This process requires two enzymes, pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase, which metabolize pyruvate to ethanol (Figure 9.11B).
7.9.4.10.3	As with lactic acid fermentation, the reactions are essentially reversible.
7.9.4.10.4	For thousands of years, humans have used anaerobic fermentation by yeast cells to produce alcoholic beverages.
7.9.4.10.5	The cells use sugars from plant sources (glucose from grapes or maltose from barley) to produce the end product, ethanol, in wine and beer.
7.9.4.11.1	By recycling NAD+, fermentation allows glycolysis to continue, thus producing small amounts of ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation.
7.9.4.11.2	The net yield of two ATPs per glucose molecule is much lower than the energy yield from cellular respiration.
7.9.4.11.3	For this reason, most organisms existing in anaerobic environments are small microbes that grow relatively slowly.
7.9.4.1.1.1	The total net energy yield from glycolysis plus fermentation is two molecules of ATP per molecule of glucose oxidized.
7.9.4.1.1.2	The maximum yield of ATP that can be harvested from a molecule of glucose through glycolysis followed by cellular respiration is much greater   about 32 molecules of ATP (Figure 9.12).
7.9.4.1.1.3	(Review Figures 9.5, 9.6, and 9.8, and p. 180 to see where all the ATP molecules come from. )
7.9.4.1.2.1	Figure 9.12 Cellular Respiration Yields More Energy Than Fermentation
7.9.4.1.3.1	Electron carriers are reduced in pyruvate oxidation and the citric acid cycle, then oxidized by the respiratory chain.
7.9.4.1.3.2	These reactions produce ATP via chemiosmosis.
7.9.4.1.4.1	Why do the metabolic pathways that operate in aerobic environments produce so much more ATP?
7.9.4.1.4.2	Glycolysis and fermentation only partially oxidize glucose.
7.9.4.1.4.3	Much more energy remains in the end products of fermentation (lactic acid and ethanol) than in CO2, the end product of cellular respiration.
7.9.4.1.4.4	In cellular respiration, carriers (mostly NAD+) are reduced during pyruvate oxidation and the citric acid cycle.
7.9.4.1.4.5	Then the reduced carriers are oxidized by the respiratory chain, with the accompanying production of ATP by chemiosmosis (about 2.5 ATP for each NADH and 1.5 ATP for each FADH2).
7.9.4.1.4.6	In an aerobic environment, a cell or organism capable of aerobic metabolism will have the advantage over one that is limited to fermentation, in terms of its ability to harvest chemical energy.
7.9.4.1.4.7	Two key events in the evolution of multicellular organisms were the rise in atmospheric O2 levels (see Key Concept 25.2) and the development of metabolic pathways to use that O2.
7.9.4.2.1.1	About 32 ATP are produced from the oxidation of one molecule of glucose to CO2.
7.9.4.2.1.2	However, in many eukaryotes the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH, and a    toll  ? of one ATP must be paid for each NADH molecule produced in glycolysis that must be    shuttled  ? into the mitochondrial matrix.
7.9.4.2.1.3	So in these organisms, the net yield of ATP is 30.
7.9.4.2.2.1	NADH shuttle systems transfer the electrons captured by glycolysis onto substrates that are capable of movement across the mitochondrial membranes.
7.9.4.2.2.2	In muscle and liver tissues (and the brown fat in the opening story), an important shuttle involves glycerol 3-phosphate.
7.9.4.2.2.3	In the cytoplasm, NADH (from glycolysis) + dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)     NAD+ + glycerol 3-phosphate
7.9.4.2.3.1	Glycerol 3-phosphate is transferred to the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane.
7.9.4.2.3.2	At that surface, FAD + glycerol 3-phosphate     FADH2 + DHAP
7.9.4.2.4.1	The electrons flow from FADH2 into the electron transport chain via ubiquinone (Q) (see Figure 9.8).
7.9.4.2.4.2	DHAP is able to move back to the cytoplasm, where it is available to repeat the process.
7.9.4.2.4.3	Note that the reducing electrons are transferred from NADH to FADH2.
7.9.4.2.4.4	As you know from Figure 9.8, the energy yield in terms of ATP from FADH2 is lower than that from NADH.
7.9.4.2.4.5	This lowers the overall energy yield.
7.9.4.2.5.1	9.4 recap
7.9.4.2.6.1	In the absence of O2, fermentation pathways use NADH formed by glycolysis to reduce pyruvate and regenerate NAD+.
7.9.4.2.6.2	The energy yield of glycolysis coupled to fermentation is low because glucose is only partially oxidized.
7.9.4.2.6.3	When O2 is present, the electron carriers of cellular respiration allow for the full oxidation of glucose, so the energy yield from glucose is much higher.
7.9.4.2.7.1	learning outcomes
7.9.4.2.8.1	You should be able to:
7.9.4.2.9.1	Describe the process of fermentation.
7.9.4.2.10.1	Why is replenishing NAD+ required to continue glycolysis in the absence of O2?
7.9.4.2.11.1	How does fermentation replenish NAD+?
7.9.4.2.12.1	Now that you   ve seen how cells harvest energy, let   s see how that energy moves through other metabolic pathways in the cell.

7.9.5.6.1	Q: Can DNA be an energy source?
7.9.5.6.2	Explain.
7.9.5.6.3	Why do you think it is not usually employed in this way?
7.9.5.7.1	Glycolysis and the pathways of cellular respiration do not operate in isolation.
7.9.5.7.2	Rather, there is an interchange of molecules into and out of these pathways, to and from the metabolic pathways for the synthesis and breakdown of amino acids, nucleotides, fatty acids, and other building blocks of life (see Figure 8.14).
7.9.5.7.3	Carbon skeletons (i. e. , the carbon backbones of organic molecules) can enter the catabolic pathways and be broken down to release their energy, or they can enter anabolic pathways to be used in the formation of the macromolecules that are the major constituents of the cell.
7.9.5.7.4	These relationships are summarized in Figure 9.13.
7.9.5.7.5	In this section we will explore how pathways are interrelated by the sharing of intermediate molecules, and we will see how pathways are regulated by the inhibitors of key enzymes.
7.9.5.8.1	focus your learning
7.9.5.9.1	The synthesis and breakdown of macromolecules in a cell are linked through common metabolic pathways.
7.9.5.10.1	Metabolic pathways are regulated to ensure efficiency and proper functioning of the cell.
7.9.5.1.1.1	A hamburger or veggie burger on a bun contains three major sources of carbon skeletons: carbohydrates, mostly in the form of starch (a polysaccharide); lipids, mostly as triglycerides (three fatty acids attached to glycerol); and proteins (polymers of amino acids).
7.9.5.1.1.2	Look at Figure 9.13 to see how each of these three types of macromolecules can be hydrolyzed and used in catabolism or anabolism.
7.9.5.1.1.1.1	Polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins can all be broken down to provide energy:
7.9.5.1.1.2.1	Polysaccharides are hydrolyzed to glucose.
7.9.5.1.1.2.2	Glucose then passes through glycolysis and cellular respiration, where its energy is captured in ATP.
7.9.5.1.1.3.1	Lipids are broken down into their constituents, glycerol and fatty acids.
7.9.5.1.1.3.2	Glycerol is converted into dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), an intermediate in glycolysis.
7.9.5.1.1.3.3	Fatty acids are highly reduced molecules that are converted to acetyl CoA inside the mitochondrion by a series of oxidation enzymes, in a process known as   -oxidation.
7.9.5.1.1.3.4	For example, the   -oxidation of a 16-carbon (C16) fatty acid occurs in several steps: C16 fatty acid + CoA     C16 fatty acyl CoA C16 fatty acyl CoA + CoA     C14 fatty acyl CoA + acetyl CoA Repeat 6 times     8 acetyl CoA
7.9.5.1.1.4.1	The acetyl CoA can then enter the citric acid cycle and be catabolized to CO2.
7.9.5.1.1.5.1	Proteins are hydrolyzed to their amino acid building blocks.
7.9.5.1.1.5.2	The 20 different amino acids feed into glycolysis or the citric acid cycle at different points determined by their structures.
7.9.5.1.1.5.3	For example, the amino acid glutamate is converted into   -ketoglutarate, an intermediate in the citric acid cycle (the five-carbon molecule in Figure 9.6).
7.9.5.1.2.1.1	Many catabolic pathways can operate essentially in reverse, with some modifications.
7.9.5.1.2.1.2	Glycolytic and citric acid cycle intermediates, instead of being oxidized to form CO2, can be reduced and used to form glucose in a process called gluconeogenesis (which means    new formation of glucose  ?).
7.9.5.1.2.1.3	Likewise, acetyl CoA can be used to form fatty acids.
7.9.5.1.2.1.4	The most common fatty acids have even numbers of carbons: 14, 16, or 18.
7.9.5.1.2.1.5	These are formed by the addition of two-carbon acetyl CoA    units  ? one at a time until the appropriate chain length is reached.
7.9.5.1.2.1.6	Acetyl CoA is also a building block for various pigments, plant growth substances, rubber, steroid hormones, and other molecules.
7.9.5.1.2.2.1	Some intermediates in the citric acid cycle are reactants in pathways that synthesize important components of nucleic acids.
7.9.5.1.2.2.2	For example,   -ketoglutarate is a starting point for purines, and oxaloacetate for pyrimidines.
7.9.5.1.2.2.3	In addition,   -ketoglutarate is a starting point for the synthesis of chlorophyll (used in photosynthesis; see Chapter 10) and the amino acid glutamate (used in protein synthesis).
7.9.5.2.1.1	Figure 9.14 Interactions of Catabolism and Anabolism during Exercise
7.9.5.2.2.1	A carbon atom from a protein in your burger can end up in DNA, fat, or CO2, among other fates.
7.9.5.2.2.2	How does the organism    decide  ? which metabolic pathways to follow, in which cells?
7.9.5.2.2.3	With all of the possible interconversions, you might expect that cellular concentrations of various biochemical molecules would vary widely.
7.9.5.2.2.4	Remarkably, the levels of these substances in what is called the metabolic pool   the sum total of all the biochemical molecules in a cell   are quite constant.
7.9.5.2.2.5	Organisms regulate the *enzymes in various cells in order to maintain a steady state between catabolism and anabolism.
7.9.5.2.2.6	For example, let   s look at how glucose levels are maintained in the body during exercise (Figure 9.14).
7.9.5.2.3.1	*connect the concepts Control of metabolic pathways often rests with regulation of enzymes already present.
7.9.5.2.3.2	Review the mechanisms of enzyme regulation in Key Concept 8.4.
7.9.5.2.4.1	When you   re walking or jogging, the muscles that most need energy are the leg muscles that power movement and the heart muscles that circulate blood.
7.9.5.2.4.2	The energy comes from the catabolism of glucose by glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation.
7.9.5.2.4.3	These muscles therefore need a lot of glucose.
7.9.5.2.4.4	Some glycogen is stored in the leg muscles and is hydrolyzed to glucose monomers.
7.9.5.2.4.5	In addition, glycogen is hydrolyzed in the liver, which releases the glucose into the blood.
7.9.5.2.4.6	As this glucose is used up by the working muscles, more glucose is made in the liver by anabolism from amino acids and pyruvate.
7.9.5.2.4.7	Some of this pyruvate comes from lactate formed by fermentation in the leg muscles and that has been transported back to the liver in the blood.
7.9.5.2.5.1	The exquisite integration of catabolism and anabolism cannot be accomplished without control points in the biochemical pathways.
7.9.5.2.5.2	For example, something must    tell  ? the liver to make glucose rather than catabolizing it or storing it.
7.9.5.2.5.3	How are the systems integrated?
7.9.5.3.1.1	The regulation of interconnecting biochemical pathways is a problem of systems biology, which seeks to understand how biochemical pathways interact (see Key Concept 8.5).
7.9.5.3.1.2	It is a bit like trying to predict traffic patterns in a city: if an accident blocks traffic on a major road, drivers take alternate routes, where the traffic volume consequently changes.
7.9.5.3.2.1	Several mechanisms can be used to regulate the rate of each step in a biochemical pathway:
7.9.5.3.3.1	Changing the amount of active enzyme: The cell can increase the expression of a gene encoding an enzyme.
7.9.5.3.4.1	Changing enzyme activity by covalent modifications: Adding phosphate groups by protein kinase can alter the activity of an enzyme.
7.9.5.3.5.1	Feedback inhibition: Allosteric changes in an enzyme due to binding of a product in a pathway can cause the entire pathway to shut down.
7.9.5.3.6.1	Substrate availability: If the substrate of a particular enzyme is used up by another pathway, the first enzyme can no longer function and the pathway shuts down.
7.9.5.3.7.1	Consider what happens to the starch in your burger bun.
7.9.5.3.7.2	In the digestive system, starch is hydrolyzed to glucose, which enters the blood for distribution to the rest of the body.
7.9.5.3.7.3	But before the glucose is distributed, a regulatory check must be made: If there is already enough glucose in the blood to supply the body   s needs, the excess glucose is converted into glycogen and stored in the liver and muscles.
7.9.5.3.7.4	If not enough glucose is supplied by food, glycogen is broken down, or other molecules are used to make glucose by gluconeogenesis.
7.9.5.3.7.5	The end result is that the level of glucose in the blood is remarkably constant.
7.9.5.3.7.6	How does the body accomplish this?
7.9.5.3.7.7	Figure 9.15 Regulation by Negative and Positive Feedback Figure 9.16 Allosteric Regulation of Glycolysis and the Citric Acid Cycle
7.9.5.3.8.1	Glycolysis and the citric acid cycle  are subject to allosteric regulation (see Key Concept 8.5) of key enzymes involved.
7.9.5.3.8.2	In a metabolic pathway, a high concentration of the final product can inhibit the action of an enzyme that catalyzes an earlier reaction (see Figure 8.18).
7.9.5.3.8.3	Furthermore, an excess of the product of one pathway can activate an enzyme in another pathway, speeding up its reactions and diverting raw materials away from synthesis of the first product (Figure 9.15).
7.9.5.3.8.4	These negative and positive feedback mechanisms are used at many points in the energy-harvesting pathways and are summarized in Figure 9.16.
7.9.5.3.9.1	The main control point in glycolysis is the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase, which catalyzes Step 3 in Figure 9.5.
7.9.5.3.9.2	This enzyme is allosterically inhibited by ATP or citrate, and activated by ADP or AMP.
7.9.5.3.9.3	Under anaerobic conditions, fermentation yields a relatively small amount of ATP, and phosphofructokinase operates at a high rate.
7.9.5.3.9.4	However, when conditions are aerobic, respiration makes 16 times more ATP than fermentation does, and the abundant ATP allosterically inhibits phosphofructokinase.
7.9.5.3.9.5	So glycolysis slows down.
7.9.5.3.10.1	The main control point in the citric acid cycle is the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (which catalyzes Step 3 in Figure 9.6).
7.9.5.3.10.2	This enzyme is activated by increases in substrate concentrations (ADP, NAD+, and isocitrate) and is inhibited by products of the citric acid cycle: ATP and NADH.
7.9.5.3.10.3	If too much ATP or NADH accumulates, the reaction is slowed, and the citric acid cycle shuts down.
7.9.5.3.11.1	Another control point involves acetyl CoA.
7.9.5.3.11.2	If the level of ATP is high and the citric acid cycle shuts down, the accumulation of citrate activates fatty acid synthase, diverting acetyl CoA to the synthesis of fatty acids for storage (contributing to a person   s accumulation of fat).
7.9.5.3.11.3	These fatty acids may be metabolized later to produce more acetyl CoA.
7.9.5.3.12.1	investigatinglife
7.9.5.3.13.1	How are mitochondria related to obesity?
7.9.5.3.14.1	Recall from the opening of this chapter that brown fat is adipose tissue with a high concentration of mitochondria, which have iron-containing pigments.
7.9.5.3.14.2	The uncoupling protein UCP1, found in the inner membranes of mitochondria in brown fat cells, uncouples mitochondrial electron transport (oxidation) and ATP production (phosphorylation), so that instead of being trapped as chemical energy in the formation of ATP, the energy released by oxidation is released as heat.
7.9.5.3.15.1	Hibernating animals take advantage of the heat emitted by the catabolism of energy-rich molecules in brown fat, especially when aroused.
7.9.5.3.15.2	In hibernating animals, brown fat and UCP1 increase during the winter.
7.9.5.3.15.3	It turns out that adult humans also experience a seasonal variation in brown fat, having more of it in the cooler months.
7.9.5.3.15.4	Other factors such as diet and exercise being equal, increased fat catabolism occurs in the presence of UCP1 (as demonstrated by the experiment in Investigating Life: Mitochondria, Genetics, and Obesity).
7.9.5.3.16.1	Genetic studies confirm the role of UCP1 in fat breakdown as well.
7.9.5.3.16.2	For example, some people have a genetically determined variant of UCP1 that has lower uncoupling activity than normal UCP1.
7.9.5.3.16.3	As people with the variant get older, they accumulate more body fat than their peers with normal UCP1 do.
7.9.5.3.17.1	Future directions
7.9.5.3.18.1	The recent finding that not just babies but also adults have mitochondrialaden brown fat has sparked interest in the possible activation of these cells to treat obesity.
7.9.5.3.18.2	In addition to occurring in well-known locations such as the neck and shoulders, brown fat cells have been found mixed in with non  brown fat all over the body, and can be seen by PET (positron emission tomography) scans.
7.9.5.3.18.3	At the U.S. National Institutes of Health, a research team led by Aaron Cypess has found unexpectedly that a drug used to treat people with an overactive bladder also activates fat breakdown in brown fat cells.
7.9.5.3.18.4	The drug, mirabegron, targets a receptor on bladder cells that is also expressed on brown fat cells.
7.9.5.3.18.5	When people without bladder disease were given this drug, brown fat cells were activated.
7.9.5.3.18.6	There was increased glucose uptake and heat production due to mitochondrial uncoupling, and also an eightfold increase in fatty acid breakdown by the mitochondria.
7.9.5.3.18.7	This could be a promising treatment for disorders that lead to obesity.

7.9.summary.3.2	Such oxidation   reduction, or redox, reactions transfer large amounts of energy.
7.9.summary.3.3	Review Figure 9.2
7.9.summary.4.1	The coenzyme NAD+ is a key electron carrier in biological redox reactions.
7.9.summary.4.2	It exists in two forms, one oxidized (NAD+) and the other reduced (NADH).

7.9.summary.5.1	Glycolysis does not use O2.
7.9.summary.5.2	Under aerobic conditions, cellular respiration continues the process of breaking down glucose.
7.9.summary.5.3	Under anaerobic conditions, fermentation occurs.
7.9.summary.5.4	Review Figures 9.1, 9.4, Activities 9.1, 9.2
7.9.summary.6.1	The pathways of cellular respiration after glycolysis are pyruvate oxidation, the citric acid cycle, and electron transport/ATP synthesis. 9.2
7.9.summary.7.1	In the Presence of Oxygen, Glucose Is Fully Oxidized
7.9.summary.8.1	Glycolysis consists of ten enzyme-catalyzed reactions that occur in the cell cytoplasm.
7.9.summary.8.2	Two pyruvate molecules are produced for each partially oxidized molecule of glucose, providing the starting material for both cellular respiration and fermentation.
7.9.summary.8.3	Review Figure 9.5
7.9.summary.9.1	Pyruvate oxidation follows glycolysis and links glycolysis to the citric acid cycle.
7.9.summary.9.2	This pathway converts pyruvate into acetyl CoA.
7.9.summary.10.1	Acetyl CoA is the starting point of the citric acid cycle.
7.9.summary.10.2	It reacts with oxaloacetate to produce citrate.
7.9.summary.10.3	A series of eight enzyme-catalyzed reactions oxidize citrate and regenerate oxaloacetate, continuing the cycle.

7.9.summary.11.1	Oxidative Phosphorylation Forms ATP
7.9.summary.12.1	Oxidation of electron carriers in the presence of O2 releases energy that can be used to form ATP in a process called oxidative phosphorylation.
7.9.summary.13.1	The NADH and FADH2 produced in glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, and the citric acid cycle are oxidized by the respiratory chain, regenerating NAD+ and FAD.
7.9.summary.13.2	Oxygen (O2) is the final acceptor of electrons and protons, forming water (H2O).
7.9.summary.13.3	Review Figure 9.7, Activity 9.4
7.9.summary.14.1	The respiratory chain not only transports electrons, but also transfers protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating the proton-motive force.
7.9.summary.15.1	Protons driven by the proton-motive force can return to the mitochondrial matrix via ATP synthase, a molecular motor that couples this movement of protons to the synthesis of ATP.
7.9.summary.15.2	This process is called chemiosmosis.
7.9.summary.15.3	Review Figure 9.8

7.9.summary.17.1	In the Absence of Oxygen, Some Energy Is Harvested from Glucose
7.9.summary.18.1	In the absence of O2 in most organisms, glycolysis is followed by fermentation.
7.9.summary.18.2	Together, these pathways partially oxidize pyruvate and generate end products such as lactic acid or ethanol.
7.9.summary.18.3	In the process, NAD+ is regenerated from NADH so that glycolysis can continue, thus generating a small amount of ATP.
7.9.summary.18.4	Review Figure 9.11
7.9.summary.19.1	For each molecule of glucose used, glycolysis plus fermentation yields two molecules of ATP.
7.9.summary.19.2	In contrast, glycolysis operating with pyruvate oxidation, the citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation yields up to 32 molecules of ATP per molecule of glucose.

7.9.summary.21.2	Review Figure 9.13
7.9.summary.22.1	Anabolic pathways use intermediate components of the energy-harvesting pathways to synthesize fats, amino acids, and other essential building blocks.
7.9.summary.23.1	The formation of glucose from intermediates of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle is called gluconeogenesis.
7.9.summary.24.1	The rates of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle are controlled by allosteric regulation and by the diversion of excess acetyl CoA into fatty acid synthesis.
7.9.summary.24.2	Key regulated enzymes include phosphofructokinase, citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and fatty acid synthase.

7.9.summary.32.2	But how effective is this strategy?
7.9.summary.32.3	What happens to the body when it is starved of food?
7.9.summary.32.4	Scientists have studied starvation in mammals to find out how their bodies compensate for a lack of food.
7.9.summary.32.5	Their findings can be used to better understand the effects of severe diets on the human body.
7.9.summary.33.1	Studies have shown that mammalian bodies need a constant supply of glucose to maintain homeostasis.
7.9.summary.33.2	Food provides a regular supply of glucose, and when there is an excess, the body stores it as glycogen.
7.9.summary.33.3	Figure A shows how cells in the human body shift in their rate of glucose oxidation and the source of glucose oxidized after food intake has stopped.

7.9.summary.35.1	These data indicate that once glycogen reserves are used up, the body uses other molecules as sources of glucose.
7.9.summary.35.2	What are these molecules?
7.9.summary.35.3	To find out, researchers studied the biochemistry of the liver, since it is the major organ where glucose is made (gluconeogenesis).
7.9.summary.35.4	They surgically removed livers from healthy rats and kept the livers in an active physiological state using perfusion.
7.9.summary.35.5	Perfusion is a technique that pumps fluids through the blood vessels of an organ to mimic the normal blood flow taking place inside a living animal.
7.9.summary.35.6	Using perfused rat livers, the researchers tested the production of glucose inside liver cells when various metabolic compounds were pumped through the isolated livers.

7.10.8.1	investigatinglife
7.10.9.1	Saving FACE
7.10.10.1	In July 2014, a satellite was launched into space to measure photosynthesis over all of Earth.
7.10.10.2	The Orbiting Carbon Observatory has instruments aboard that map not only the concentration of carbon dioxide, but also the presence of the green plant pigment chlorophyll.
7.10.10.3	Why these measurements, and why now?
7.10.11.1	As you may know, green plants use the pigment chlorophyll in photosynthesis, which has the general equation
7.10.12.1	The orbiting satellite is measuring chlorophyll, a reflection of the presence of green plants, and CO2 over time because the global atmosphere and biological communities are changing.
7.10.12.2	Over the past 200 years, the concentration of atmospheric CO2 has increased&#x2013;from 280 parts per million (ppm) in the year 1800 to 400 ppm in 2016&#x2013;and the increase will probably continue for some time.
7.10.12.3	Carbon dioxide is a &#8220;greenhouse gas&#8221; that traps heat in the atmosphere, and the rising CO2 level is resulting in global climate change.
7.10.12.4	Plant biologists are being asked two questions about the rise in CO2: will it lead to an increased rate of photosynthesis, and if so, will it lead to increased plant growth?
7.10.13.1	To answer these questions, scientists developed a way to expose plants to high levels of CO2 in the field.
7.10.13.2	Free-air concentration enrichment (FACE) uses rings of pipes to release CO2 into the air surrounding plants in fields or forests.
7.10.13.3	Wind speed and direction are monitored by a computer, which constantly controls which pipes release CO2.
7.10.13.4	These experiments confirm that photosynthetic rates increase as the concentration of CO2 rises, and indicate that as atmospheric CO2 rises globally, there will be an increase in photosynthesis.
7.10.14.1	Will this increase in photosynthesis result in an increase in plant growth?
7.10.14.2	Keep in mind that plants, like all organisms, use carbohydrates as an energy source.
7.10.14.3	They perform cellular respiration with the general equation
7.10.15.1	The challenge facing plant biologists is to determine the balance between photosynthesis and respiration and how this affects the rate of plant growth.
7.10.15.2	The FACE experiments indicate that plant growth and crop yields increase under higher CO2 concentrations, suggesting that the overall increase in photosynthesis is greater than the increase in respiration.
7.10.16.1	What is the chemistry of photosynthesis, and how will it be affected by rising atmospheric CO2?
7.10.17.1	Chapter 10 continues with
7.10.18.1	10.1  Photosynthesis Uses Light to Make Carbohydrate
7.10.1.1.1	Photosynthesis involves light and gas exchange
7.10.1.2.1	Experiments with isotopes show that O2 comes from H2O in oxygenic photosynthesis
7.10.1.3.1	Photosynthesis involves two pathways
7.10.1.4.1	Recall that catabolism   the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler units   is the reverse of anabolism   the construction of complex molecules from simpler units.
7.10.1.4.2	Chapter 9 described several energy-releasing catabolic pathways.
7.10.1.4.3	The energy stored in chemical bonds in almost all organisms (with the exception of those living near deep-sea vents) ultimately comes from the sun.
7.10.1.4.4	Photosynthesis (literally, &#x201C;synthesis from light&#x201D;) is an anabolic process by which the energy of sunlight is captured and used to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into more complex carbon-containing compounds.
7.10.1.5.1	focus your learning
7.10.1.6.1	Water molecules supply the protons and electrons needed to reduce carbon dioxide to carbohydrate in oxygenic photosynthesis.
7.10.1.7.1	Photosynthesis occurs via two sequential reactions: light reactions followed by light-independent reactions.
7.10.1.1.1.1	Plants, algae, and cyanobacteria live in aerobic environments and carry out oxygenic photosynthesis: the conversion of CO2 and water (H2O) into carbohydrates (which we will represent as a six-carbon sugar, C6H12O6) and oxygen gas (O2)(Figure 10.1) Figure 10.1  The Ingredients for Photosynthesis
7.10.1.1.2.1	Some kinds of bacteria live in anaerobic environments and carry out a type of photosynthesis in which energy from the sun is used to convert CO2 to more complex molecules without the production of O2.
7.10.1.1.2.2	We will describe this process in more detail below, but first let&#x2019;s look at oxygenic photosynthesis.
7.10.1.1.3.1	Equation 10.1 describes an endergonic reaction.
7.10.1.1.3.2	From experiments such as the ones described in the chapter-opening story using FACE, the role of CO2 is well established.
7.10.1.1.3.3	But while the equation is essentially correct, it is too general for a real understanding of the processes involved.
7.10.1.1.3.4	Several questions arise: What are the precise chemical reactions of photosynthesis?
7.10.1.1.3.5	What role does light play in these reactions?
7.10.1.1.3.6	How do carbons become linked to form carbohydrates?
7.10.1.1.3.7	What carbohydrates are formed?
7.10.1.1.3.8	And does the oxygen gas come from CO2 or H2O?
7.10.1.2.1.1	In 1941 Samuel Ruben and Martin Kamen at the University of California, Berkeley performed experiments using the isotopes 18O and 16O to identify the source of the O2 produced during photosynthesis (Investigating Life: What is the chemistry of photosynthesis, and how will increasing CO2 in the atmosphere affect it?).
7.10.1.2.1.2	Their results showed that all the oxygen gas produced during photosynthesis comes from water, as is reflected in the revised balanced equation:
7.10.1.2.2.1	Water appears on both sides of the equation because it is both used as a reactant (the 12 molecules on the left) and released as a product (the 6 new molecules on the right).
7.10.1.2.2.2	This revised equation accounts for all the water molecules needed for all the oxygen gas produced.
7.10.1.2.3.1	The realization that water was the source of photosynthetic O2 led to an understanding of photosynthesis in terms of oxidation and reduction.
7.10.1.2.3.2	As you learned in Chapter 9, oxidation   reduction (redox) reactions are coupled: when one molecule becomes oxidized in a reaction, another gets reduced.
7.10.1.2.3.3	In this case, oxygen atoms in the reduced state in H2O get oxidized to O2:
7.10.1.2.4.1	while carbon atoms in the oxidized state in CO2 get reduced to carbohydrate, with the simultaneous production of water:
7.10.1.2.5.1	Adding Equations 10.3 and 10.4 (chemistry students will recognize them as half-cell reactions) gives the overall Equation 10.2 shown above.
7.10.1.2.6.1	As you have just seen, water is the donor of protons and electrons in oxygenic photosynthesis.
7.10.1.2.6.2	Earlier, we mentioned a type of photosynthesis that does not produce O2.
7.10.1.2.6.3	In these cases, other molecules are used as electron donors in the reduction of CO2 to carbohydrates.
7.10.1.2.6.4	For example, purple sulfur bacteria use hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as the electron donor:
7.10.1.2.7.1	Green sulfur bacteria use sulfide ions, hydrogen, or ferrous iron as electron donors, whereas another group of bacteria use compounds derived from arsenic.
7.10.1.2.7.2	The remainder of this chapter will focus on oxygenic photosynthesis, which produces the vast majority of the organic carbon used by life on Earth today and replenishes the O2 in our atmosphere.

7.10.1.2.12.1	Understanding the chemical reactions of photosynthesis is key to understanding the effects of increasing atmospheric CO2.
7.10.1.2.12.2	In particular, the source of O2 was not known.
7.10.1.2.12.3	Two possibilities were the reactants, CO2 and H2O.
7.10.1.2.12.4	In two separate experiments, Samuel Ruben and Martin Kamen labeled the oxygen in these molecules with the isotope 18O, then tested the O2 produced by a green plant to find out which molecules contributed the oxygen.

7.10.1.2.15.1	CONCLUSION  Water is the source of the oxygen atoms in the O2 produced by photosynthesis.
7.10.1.2.16.1	work with the data
7.10.1.2.17.1	In the 1930s, Cornelius van Niel, then a graduate student at Stanford University, was the first to propose that the oxygen released during photosynthesis is not actually derived from carbon dioxide, but rather from the water molecules consumed in the reaction.
7.10.1.2.17.2	This hypothesis was formed on the basis of the discovery that the anaerobic purple sulfur bacteria do not release oxygen during photosynthesis.
7.10.1.2.17.3	Instead, these organisms convert hydrogen sulfide (H2S) into elemental sulfur in their photosynthetic pathway (see Equation 10.5).
7.10.1.2.17.4	This hypothesis was later confirmed by the experiment outlined above, which employed the &#8220;heavy&#8221; isotope of oxygen, 18O, to trace the flow of oxygen in plants.
7.10.1.2.18.1	As part of the expanding research on radioisotopes during World War II, the U.S. government set up a radiation laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley.
7.10.1.2.18.2	Out of this lab came key experiments that described the light-dependent and light-independent pathways of photosynthesis.
7.10.1.2.18.3	In this set of experiments, Chlorella algal cells were exposed to water and CO2, the latter coming from potassium carbonate (K2CO3) and potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3&#x2013;), which dissolve in water to form CO2.
7.10.1.2.18.4	In Experiment 1, water had a higher isotopic ratio of 18O/16O than CO2 and in Experiment 2, CO2 had a higher isotopic ratio than water.
7.10.1.2.18.5	A mass spectrometer was used to measure the isotopic contents of the reactants and the O2 produced, and the data were presented as the isotopic ratio (18O/16O).
7.10.1.2.18.6	These data are shown in the table.
7.10.1.2.19.1	QUESTIONS
7.10.1.2.20.1	In Experiment 1, was the isotopic ratio of O2 similar to that of H2O or to that of CO2?
7.10.1.2.20.2	What about in Experiment 2?
7.10.1.2.21.1	What can you conclude from these data? &#160; Time before start of O2 collection (min) Time at end of O2 collection (min) 18O/16O (proportion 18O in compound) H2O HCO3&#x2013; + CO32&#x2013; (CO2 sources) O2 Experiment 1: 0 0.85 0.20 0.09 M KHCO3 + 0.09 M K2CO3 (18O in H2O) 45 110 0.85 0.41 0.84 110 223 0.85 0.55 0.85 225 350 0.85 0.61 0.86 Experiment 2: 0 0.20 0.14 M KHCO3 + 0.06 M K2CO3 (18O in CO2) 40 110 0.20 0.50 0.20 110 185 0.20 0.40 0.20

7.10.1.3.1.1	Equation 10.2 above summarizes the overall process of photosynthesis, but not the steps by which it happens.
7.10.1.3.1.2	Water serves as the electron donor, but there is an intermediary carrier of the H+ and electrons between the oxidation and reduction reactions.
7.10.1.3.1.3	The carrier is the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+).
7.10.1.3.2.1	focus: key figure
7.10.1.3.3.1	Figure 10.2 An Overview of Photosynthesis
7.10.1.3.4.1	Photosynthesis consists of two pathways: the light reactions and the light-independent reactions.
7.10.1.3.4.2	These reactions take place in the thylakoids and the stroma of chloroplasts, respectively.
7.10.1.3.4.3	See Figure 5.12 for more on the structure of chloroplasts.
7.10.1.3.5.1	Q:In the cell, where does the reduction of CO2 occur and what is the reducing agent?
7.10.1.3.6.1	Like glycolysis and the other metabolic pathways that harvest energy in cells, photosynthesis has many steps.
7.10.1.3.6.2	These reactions are commonly divided into two main pathways:
7.10.1.3.7.1	The light reactions convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of ATP and the reduced electron carrier NADPH.
7.10.1.3.7.2	This molecule is similar to the coenzyme NADH (see Key Concept 9.1) but with an additional phosphate group attached to the sugar of its adenosine.
7.10.1.3.7.3	In general, NADPH acts as a reducing agent in photosynthesis and other anabolic reactions.
7.10.1.3.8.1	The light-independent reactions (carbon-fixation reactions) do not use light directly, but instead use ATP, NADPH (made by the light reactions), and CO2 to produce carbohydrate.
7.10.1.3.9.1	The light-independent reactions are sometimes called the dark reactions because they do not directly require light energy.
7.10.1.3.9.2	They are also called the carbon-fixation reactions because by these reactions inorganic carbon is assimilated, or &#x201C;fixed,&#x201D; into organic compounds.
7.10.1.3.9.3	However, in most plants both the light reactions and the light-independent reactions stop in the dark because ATP synthesis and NADP+ reduction require light.
7.10.1.3.9.4	So to be accurate, we use the term light-independent reactions.
7.10.1.3.9.5	The reactions of both pathways proceed within the chloroplast, but they are compartmentalized, occurring in different parts of that organelle (Focus: Key Figure 10.2).
7.10.1.3.10.1	As we describe these two series of reactions in more detail, you will see that they conform to the principles of biochemistry that we discussed in Chapters 8 and 9: energy transformations, oxidation   reduction, and the stepwise nature of biochemical pathways.
7.10.1.3.11.1	10.1 recap
7.10.1.3.12.1	The light reactions of photosynthesis convert light energy into chemical energy.
7.10.1.3.12.2	The light-independent reactions use that chemical energy to reduce CO2 to carbohydrates.
7.10.1.3.12.3	While most photosynthetic organisms use water as the electron donor for reduction of CO2, some use other molecules, such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S).

7.10.2.8.1	Chemiosmosis is the source of the ATP produced in photophosphorylation
7.10.2.9.1	Light is a form of energy, and it can be converted to other forms of energy such as heat or chemical energy.
7.10.2.9.2	Our focus here will be on light as the source of energy to drive the formation of ATP (from ADP and Pi) and NADPH (from NADP+ and H+).
7.10.2.10.1	focus your learning
7.10.2.11.1	Plants have pigment molecules that receive light energy and convert it to chemical energy in the form of excited electrons.
7.10.2.12.1	Electron transport systems and two coordinated photosystems harvest the chemical energy of excited electrons to produce NADPH and ATP.
7.10.0.0.1.1	It is helpful here to discuss light in terms of its photochemistry and photobiology.
7.10.0.1.0-1.1.1	Figure 10.3 The Electromagnetic Spectrum
7.10.0.1.0-1.2.1	Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation.
7.10.0.1.0-1.2.2	Electromagnetic radiation is said to have a dual nature.
7.10.0.1.0-1.2.3	Although it is propagated in waves, it also has particle-like behaviors.
7.10.0.1.0-1.2.4	Particles of light can be described as packets of energy called photons, which have no mass.
7.10.0.1.0-1.2.5	The amount of energy in electromagnetic radiation is inversely proportional to its wavelength   the shorter the wavelength, the greater the energy.
7.10.0.1.0-1.2.6	The visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (Figure 10.3) encompasses a wide range of wavelengths and energy levels.
7.10.0.1.0-1.2.7	In plants and other photosynthetic organisms, receptive molecules absorb photons and thereby harvest their energy for biological processes.
7.10.0.1.0-1.2.8	These receptive molecules absorb only specific wavelengths of light   photons with specific amounts of energy.
7.10.0.1.0-1.3.1	When a photon meets a molecule, one of three things can happen:
7.10.0.1.0-1.4.1	The photon may bounce off the molecule   it may be scattered or reflected.
7.10.0.1.0-1.5.1	The photon may pass through the molecule   it may be transmitted.
7.10.0.1.0-1.6.1	The photon may be absorbed by the molecule, adding energy to the molecule.
7.10.0.1.0-1.7.1	Neither of the first two outcomes causes any change in the molecule.
7.10.0.1.0-1.7.2	However, in the case of absorption, the photon disappears and its energy is absorbed by the molecule.
7.10.0.1.0-1.7.3	The photon&#x2019;s energy cannot disappear, because according to the first law of thermodynamics, energy is neither created nor destroyed.
7.10.0.1.0-1.7.4	When the molecule acquires the energy of the photon, it is raised from a ground state (with lower energy) to an excited state (with higher energy):
7.10.0.1.0-1.8.1	The difference in free energy between the molecule&#x2019;s excited state and its ground state is approximately equal to the free energy of the absorbed photon (a small amount of energy is lost to entropy, according to the second law of thermodynamics).
7.10.0.1.0-1.8.2	The increase in energy boosts one of the electrons in the molecule into a *shell farther from its nucleus; this electron is now held less firmly, making the molecule unstable and more chemically reactive.
7.10.0.1.0-1.9.1	*connect the concepts As discussed in Key Concept 2.1, the electrons orbiting an atom are distributed in a series of electron shells, or energy levels, around the nucleus.
7.10.0.1.0-1.9.2	The farther an electron is from the nucleus, the higher its energy level.
7.10.0.2.1-2.1.1	The specific wavelengths absorbed by a particular molecule are characteristic of that type of molecule.
7.10.0.2.1-2.1.2	Molecules that absorb wavelengths in the visible spectrum are called pigments.
7.10.0.2.1-2.2.1	When a beam of white light (containing all the wavelengths of visible light) falls on a pigment, certain wavelengths are absorbed.
7.10.0.2.1-2.2.2	The remaining wavelengths are scattered or transmitted and make the pigment appear to us as colored.
7.10.0.2.1-2.2.3	For example, the pigment chlorophyll absorbs both blue and red light, and we see the remaining light, which is primarily green.
7.10.0.2.1-2.2.4	If we plot light absorbed by a purified pigment against wavelength, the result is an absorption spectrum for that pigment.
7.10.0.2.1-2.3.1	In contrast to the absorption spectrum, an action spectrum is a plot of the rate of photosynthesis carried out by an organism against the wavelengths of light to which it is exposed.
7.10.0.2.1-2.3.2	An action spectrum for photosynthesis can be determined as follows:
7.10.0.2.1-2.4.1	Place the organism in a closed container.
7.10.0.2.1-2.5.1	Expose it to light of a certain wavelength for a period of time.
7.10.0.2.1-2.6.1	Measure the rate of photosynthesis by the amount of O2 released.
7.10.0.2.1-2.7.1	Repeat with light of other wavelengths.
7.10.0.2.1-2.8.1	Figure 10.4 shows the absorption spectra of pigments in Anacharis, a common aquarium plant, and the action spectrum for photosynthesis by that plant.
7.10.0.2.1-2.8.2	The two spectra can be compared to see which pigments in Anacharis contribute most to light harvesting for photosynthesis.
7.10.0.2.1-2.8.3	Figure 10.4 Absorption and Action Spectra
7.10.0.2.1-2.9.1	Q: If you overfertilize the soil of a potted plant, the plant often wilts.
7.10.0.2.1-2.9.2	Why?
7.10.0.2.1-2.9.3	Figure 10.5A Photosystem and Chlorophyll
7.10.0.2.1-2.10.1	The major pigment used to drive the light reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis is chlorophyll a. (In Figure 10.4 you can see that the wavelengths at which photosynthesis is highest in Anacharis are the same wavelengths at which chlorophyll a absorbs the most light. ) Chlorophyll a has a complex ring structure (Figure 10.5), similar to that of the heme group of hemoglobin, with a magnesium ion at the center.
7.10.0.2.1-2.10.2	A long hydrocarbon &#x201C;tail&#x201D; anchors the molecule to proteins within a large multi-protein complex called a photosystem, which spans the thylakoid membrane.
7.10.0.2.1-2.10.3	Molecules of chlorophyll a and various accessory pigments (such as chlorophylls b and c, carotenoids, and phycobilins; see below) are arranged into light-harvesting complexes, also called antenna systems.
7.10.0.2.1-2.10.4	Multiple light-harvesting complexes surround a single reaction center within the photosystem.
7.10.0.2.1-2.11.1	Light energy is captured by the light-harvesting complexes and transferred to the reaction center, where chlorophyll a molecules participate in redox reactions that convert the light energy to chemical energy.
7.10.0.2.1-2.12.1	Chlorophyll absorbs blue and red light, which are near the two ends of the visible spectrum (see Figure 10.3).
7.10.0.2.1-2.12.2	The various accessory pigments absorb light in other parts of the spectrum and thus function to broaden the range of wavelengths that can be used for photosynthesis.
7.10.0.2.1-2.12.3	You can see this in the action spectrum in Figure 10.4B: Anacharis is able to photosynthesize at wavelengths of light that chlorophyll a doesn&#x2019;t absorb but that other pigments absorb (e. g. , 500 nanometers [nm]).
7.10.0.2.1-2.12.4	Different photosynthetic organisms have different combinations of accessory pigments.
7.10.0.2.1-2.12.5	Higher plants and green algae have chlorophyll b (with a structure and absorption spectrum very similar to that of chlorophyll a) and carotenoids such as   -carotene, which absorb photons in the blue and blue-green wavelengths.
7.10.0.2.1-2.12.6	Phycobilins, which are found in red algae and cyanobacteria, absorb various yellow-green, yellow, and orange wavelengths.
7.10.0.1.0-15.1.1	Figure 10.6 Energy Transfer and Electron Transport
7.10.0.1.0-15.2.1	When a pigment molecule absorbs light, it enters an excited state.
7.10.0.1.0-15.2.2	This is an unstable situation, and the molecule rapidly returns to its ground state, releasing most of the absorbed energy.
7.10.0.1.0-15.2.3	So rapid is this process that it is measured in picoseconds (trillionths of a second).
7.10.0.1.0-15.2.4	Within the antennae system of a photosystem (Figure 10.6A), the energy released by a pigment molecule (for example, chlorophyll b) is absorbed by other, adjacent pigment molecules.
7.10.0.1.0-15.2.5	The energy (not as electrons but in the form of chemical energy called resonance) is passed from molecule to molecule until it reaches a chlorophyll a molecule at the reaction center of the photosystem (Figure 10.6B).
7.10.0.1.0-15.3.1	A ground-state chlorophyll a molecule at the reaction center (symbolized by Chl) absorbs the energy from the adjacent chlorophylls and becomes excited (Chl*), but to return to the ground state this chlorophyll does not pass the energy to another pigment molecule   something very different occurs.
7.10.0.1.0-15.3.2	The reaction center converts the absorbed light energy into chemical energy (Figure 10.7).
7.10.0.1.0-15.3.3	The chlorophyll molecule in the reaction center absorbs sufficient energy that it actually gives up its excited electron to a chemical acceptor:
7.10.0.1.0-15.4.1	Figure 10.7 Noncyclic Electron Transport Uses Two Photosystems
7.10.0.1.0-15.5.1	Absorption of light energy by chlorophyll molecules in the reaction centers of photosystems I and II allows them to pass electrons into a series of redox reactions.
7.10.0.1.0-15.6.1	Q:An herbicide can act as an electron acceptor, becoming reduced by ferredoxin (Fd).
7.10.0.1.0-15.6.2	What effect would this have on a plant?
7.10.0.1.0-15.7.1	This, then, is the first consequence of light absorption by chlorophyll: the reaction center chlorophyll (Chl*) loses its excited electron in a redox reaction and becomes Chl+.
7.10.0.1.0-15.7.2	As a result of this transfer of an electron, the chlorophyll gets oxidized, while the acceptor molecule is reduced.
7.10.0.1.0-18.1.1	The electron acceptor that is reduced by Chl* is the first in a chain of electron carriers in the thylakoid membrane.
7.10.0.1.0-18.1.2	Electrons are passed from one carrier to another in an energetically &#x201C;downhill&#x201D; series of reductions and oxidations.
7.10.0.1.0-18.1.3	The final electron acceptor is NADP+, which gets reduced:
7.10.0.1.0-18.2.1	As in mitochondria, ATP is produced chemiosmotically in the thylakoid membrane during the process of photophosphorylation, which we will illustrate shortly.
7.10.0.1.0-18.2.2	The overall process involves two *electron transport processes, noncylic and cylic.
7.10.0.1.0-18.2.3	The noncyclic electron transport reactions that use the energy from light to generate ATP and NADPH are illustrated in Figure 10.7.
7.10.0.1.0-18.3.1	*connect the concepts The thylakoid membrane has an electron transport system similar to the respiratory chain of mitochondria (see Key Concept 9.3).
7.10.0.1.0-18.4.1	As seen in Figure 10.7, two coordinated photosystems, each with its own reaction center, collaborate to produce ATP and NADPH:
7.10.0.1.0-18.5.1	Photosystem I (containing the &#x201C;P700&#x201D; chlorophylls at its reaction center) absorbs light energy best at 700 nm and passes its excited electrons (via intermediate molecules) to NADP+, reducing it to NADPH.
7.10.0.1.0-18.6.1	Photosystem II (with &#x201C;P680&#x201D; chlorophylls at its reaction center) absorbs light energy best at 680 nm, oxidizes water molecules, and passes its energized electrons through a series of carriers to produce ATP.
7.10.0.1.0-18.7.1	Let&#x2019;s look in more detail at these photosystems, beginning with photosystem II.
7.10.0.1.0-22.1.1	After an excited chlorophyll in the reaction center (Chl*) gives up its energetic electron to reduce a chemical acceptor molecule, the chlorophyll lacks an electron and is very unstable.
7.10.0.1.0-22.1.2	It has a strong tendency to obtain an electron from another molecule to replace the one it lost   in chemical terms, it is a strong oxidizing agent.
7.10.0.1.0-22.1.3	The replenishing electrons come from water, splitting the H   O   H bonds:
7.10.0.1.0-22.2.1	Notice that the source of O2 in photosynthesis is H2O (as demonstrated in Investigating Life: What is the chemistry of photosynthesis, and how will increasing CO2 in the atmosphere affect it?).
7.10.0.1.0-22.3.1	Back to the electron acceptor in the electron transport system: the energetic electrons are passed through a series of membrane-bound carriers to a final acceptor at a lower energy level.
7.10.0.1.0-22.3.2	As in the mitochondrion, a proton gradient is generated and is used by ATP synthase to make ATP (see below).
7.10.0.1.0-26.1.1	In photosystem I, an excited electron from the Chl* at the reaction center reduces an acceptor.
7.10.0.1.0-26.1.2	The oxidized chlorophyll (Chl+) now obtains an electron, but in this case the electron comes from the last carrier in the electron transport system.
7.10.0.1.0-26.1.3	This links the two photosystems chemically.
7.10.0.1.0-26.1.4	They are also linked spatially, with the two photosystems adjacent to one another in the thylakoid membrane.
7.10.0.1.0-26.1.5	The energetic electrons from photosystem I pass through several molecules and end up reducing NADP+ to NADPH.
7.10.0.1.0-26.1.6	Figure 10.8 Cyclic Electron Transport Traps Light Energy as ATP
7.10.0.1.0-26.2.1	Next in the process of harvesting light energy to produce carbohydrates is the series of carbon-fixation reactions.
7.10.0.1.0-26.2.2	These reactions require more ATP than NADPH.
7.10.0.1.0-26.2.3	If the pathway we just described   the linear or noncyclic pathway   were the only set of light reactions operating, there might not be sufficient ATP for carbon fixation.
7.10.0.1.0-26.2.4	Cyclic electron transport makes up for this imbalance.
7.10.0.1.0-26.2.5	This pathway uses photosystem I and the electron transport system to produce ATP but not NADPH; it is cyclic because an electron is passed from an excited chlorophyll and recycles back to the same chlorophyll (Figure 10.8).
7.10.0.0.1.1	Figure 10.9 Photophosphorylation
7.10.0.0.2.1	In Chapter 9 you learned about the chemiosmotic mechanism for ATP formation in the mitochondrion.
7.10.0.0.2.2	A similar mechanism, called photophosphorylation, operates in the chloroplast, where electron transport is coupled to the transport of protons (H+) across the thylakoid membrane, resulting in a proton gradient across the membrane (Figure 10.9).
7.10.0.0.3.1	The electron carriers in the thylakoid membrane are oriented so that protons are transferred from the stroma into the lumen of the thylakoid.
7.10.0.0.3.2	Thus the lumen becomes more acidic (higher concentration of protons) compared with the stroma, resulting in an electrochemical gradient across the thylakoid membrane, whose bilayer is not permeable to H+.
7.10.0.0.3.3	Water oxidation creates more H+ in the thylakoid lumen, and NADP+ reduction removes H+ in the stroma.
7.10.0.0.3.4	Both reactions contribute to the H+ gradient.
7.10.0.0.3.5	The high concentration of H+ in the thylakoid space drives the movement of H+ back into the stroma through protein channels in the membrane.
7.10.0.0.3.6	These channels are also enzymes   ATP synthases   that couple the movement of protons to the formation of ATP, as they do in mitochondria (see Figure 9.8).
7.10.0.0.3.7	Indeed, the amino acid sequence of chloroplast ATP synthase is about 60 percent identical to human mitochondrial ATP synthase   a remarkable similarity, given that plants and animals had their most recent common ancestor more than a billion years ago.
7.10.0.0.3.8	This is testimony to the evolutionary unity of life.
7.10.0.0.4.1	The mechanisms of the two enzymes are similar, but their orientations differ.
7.10.0.0.4.2	In chloroplasts, protons flow through the ATP synthase out of the thylakoid lumen into the stroma (where the ATP is synthesized).
7.10.0.0.4.3	In mitochondria, the protons flow out of the intermembrane space into the mitochondrial matrix.
7.10.0.0.5.1	10.2 recap
7.10.0.0.6.1	Conversion of light energy into chemical energy occurs when photons are absorbed by chlorophylls and accessory pigments in the light-harvesting complex within the chloroplast.
7.10.0.0.6.2	Light energy is used to drive a series of protein-associated redox reactions in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast.
7.10.0.0.6.3	In the process of photophosphorylation, two linked photosystems establish a proton gradient across the membrane that drives ATP synthesis.
7.10.0.0.7.1	learning outcomes
7.10.0.0.8.1	You should be able to:
7.10.0.0.9.1	Describe the transfer of energy within the reaction center of a light-harvesting complex.

7.10.0.0.14.1	How does cyclic electron transport in photosystem I result in the production of ATP?
7.10.0.0.15.1	You have seen how light energy drives the synthesis of ATP and NADPH in the stroma of chloroplasts.
7.10.0.0.15.2	We will now turn to the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis, which use energy-rich ATP and NADPH to reduce CO2 and form carbohydrates.
7.10.0.0.16.1	Chapter 10 continues with
7.10.0.0.17.1	10.3 Chemical Energy Trapped in Photosynthesis Is Used to Synthesize Carbohydrates
7.10.3.1.1	How were the steps in carbohydrate synthesis elucidated?
7.10.3.2.1	The Calvin cycle is made up of three processes
7.10.3.3.1	Light stimulates the Calvin cycle
7.10.3.4.1	Most of the enzymes that catalyze the reactions of CO2 fixation are in the stroma of the chloroplast, where those reactions take place.
7.10.3.4.2	These enzymes use the energy in ATP and NADPH to reduce CO2 to carbohydrates.
7.10.3.4.3	Therefore, with some exceptions, CO2 fixation occurs only in the light, when ATP and NADPH are being generated.
7.10.3.5.1	focus your learning
7.10.3.6.1	The Calvin cycle describes the chemical steps that produce carbohydrates from carbon dioxide in the stroma of the chloroplast.
7.10.3.7.1	Light affects photosynthetic carbon fixation.
7.10.0.0.1.1	To identify the reactions by which the carbon from CO2 ends up in carbohydrates, scientists found a way to label CO2 so they could isolate and identify the compounds formed from it during photosynthesis.
7.10.0.0.1.2	In the 1950s, Melvin Calvin, Andrew Benson, and their colleagues used radioactively labeled CO2 in which some of the carbon atoms were the radioisotope 14C rather than the normal 12C.
7.10.0.0.1.3	They were able to trace the chemical pathway of CO2 fixation (Figure 10.10).
7.10.0.0.1.4	The first molecule that appeared in the pathway was a three-carbon sugar phosphate called 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) (the 14C is shown in red):

7.10.0.0.7.1	HYPOTHESIS  The first product of CO2 fixation is a 3-carbon molecule.
7.10.0.0.8.1	CONCLUSION  The initial product of CO2 fixation is 3PG.
7.10.0.0.8.2	Later, the carbon from CO2 ends up in many molecules.
7.10.0.0.9.1	work with the data
7.10.0.0.10.1	Figure 10.10B Tracing the Pathway of CO2
7.10.0.0.11.1	Original Paper: Benson, A. A. et al. 1950.
7.10.0.0.12.1	To elucidate the sequence of reactions that allow carbon fixation, Melvin Calvin and colleagues exposed suspensions of the green alga Chlorella to 14CO2 (see Figure 10.10A).
7.10.0.0.12.2	After 3 sec of photosynthesis, the 14C from 14CO2 was found only in 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), but after 30 sec many compounds were radioactive.
7.10.0.0.12.3	Calvin and his colleagues then expanded on these results and were able to determine the exact sequence of reactions and reaction intermediates in the Calvin cycle by exposing the cells to 14CO2 for various periods of time.
7.10.0.0.13.1	The first reaction in CO2 fixation can occur in the dark.
7.10.0.0.13.2	To show this, Calvin and his colleagues exposed Chlorella cells to 14CO2 under bright lights for 20 min and harvested the cells.
7.10.0.0.13.3	Then they repeated the experiment, but following the 20 min of light with varying periods of darkness (30 sec, 2 min, and 5 min).
7.10.0.0.13.4	They harvested cells and made chromatograms to identify the labeled compounds, and used a radioactivity detector to quantify the amount of 14C in each compound.
7.10.0.0.13.5	The data are shown in the table.

7.10.0.0.14.1	QUESTIONS
7.10.0.0.15.1	Plot radioactivity in 3PG versus time.
7.10.0.0.15.2	What do the data show?
7.10.0.0.16.1	Why did the amount of radioactively labeled RuBP decline after 30 seconds in the dark?
7.10.0.0.17.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.10.0.0.18.1	Using successively longer exposures to 14CO2, Calvin and his colleagues were able to trace the route of 14C as it moved through a series of compounds, including monosaccharides and amino acids.
7.10.0.0.18.2	It turned out the 14C moved through a cyclical pathway.
7.10.0.0.18.3	In this cycle, the CO2 initially bonds covalently to a five-carbon acceptor molecule.
7.10.0.0.18.4	The resulting six-carbon intermediate quickly breaks into two three-carbon molecules.
7.10.0.0.18.5	As the cycle repeats, a carbohydrate is produced and the initial CO2 acceptor is regenerated.
7.10.0.0.18.6	This pathway was appropriately named the Calvin cycle.
7.10.0.0.18.7	Figure 10.11 RuBP Is the Carbon Dioxide Acceptor
7.10.0.0.19.1	The initial reaction in the Calvin cycle adds the one-carbon CO2 to the five-carbon acceptor molecule ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP).
7.10.0.0.19.2	The product is an intermediate six-carbon compound, which quickly breaks down and forms two molecules of 3PG (Figure 10.11).
7.10.0.0.19.3	The intermediate compound is broken down so rapidly that Calvin did not observe radioactive carbon appearing in it first.
7.10.0.0.19.4	The enzyme that catalyzes its formation, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase(rubisco), is the most abundant protein in the world!
7.10.0.0.19.5	It constitutes up to 50 percent of all the protein in every plant leaf.
7.10.0.1.0-2.1.1	The Calvin cycle uses the ATP and NADPH made in the light to reduce CO2 in the stroma to a carbohydrate.
7.10.0.1.0-2.1.2	As in all biochemical pathways, each reaction is catalyzed by a specific enzyme.
7.10.0.1.0-2.1.3	The cycle is composed of three distinct processes (Figure 10.12):
7.10.0.1.0-2.2.1	Figure 10.12 The Calvin Cycle The Calvin cycle uses the ATP and NADPH generated in the light reactions and CO2 to produce carbohydrate.
7.10.0.1.0-2.2.2	Six turns of the cycle produce the equivalent of one molecule of glucose, a hexose sugar.
7.10.0.1.0-2.3.1	Fixation of CO2.
7.10.0.1.0-2.3.2	As we have seen, this reaction is catalyzed by rubisco, and its stable product is 3PG.
7.10.0.1.0-2.4.1	Reduction of 3PG to form glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P).
7.10.0.1.0-2.4.2	This series of reactions involves a phosphorylation (using the ATP made in the light reactions) and a reduction (coupled to the oxidation of NADPH made in the light reactions).
7.10.0.1.0-2.5.1	Regeneration of the CO2 acceptor, RuBP.
7.10.0.1.0-2.5.2	Most of the G3P ends up as ribulose monophosphate (RuMP), and ATP is used to convert this compound into RuBP.
7.10.0.1.0-2.5.3	So for every &#x201C;turn&#x201D; of the cycle, one CO2 is fixed and one CO2 acceptor is regenerated.
7.10.0.1.0-2.6.1	The product of this cycle is glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P), which is a three-carbon sugar phosphate, also called triose phosphate:
7.10.0.1.0-2.7.1	In a typical leaf, five-sixths of the G3P is recycled into RuBP.
7.10.0.1.0-2.7.2	There are two fates for the remaining G3P, depending on the time of day and the needs of different parts of the plant:
7.10.0.1.0-2.8.1	Some of the G3P is exported out of the chloroplast to the cytoplasm, where it is converted to hexoses (glucose and fructose).
7.10.0.1.0-2.8.2	These molecules may be used in glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration to power the activities of photosynthetic cells (see Chapter 9) or they may be converted into the disaccharide sucrose, which is transported out of the leaf to other organs in the plant.
7.10.0.1.0-2.8.3	There the sucrose is hydrolyzed to its constituent monosaccharides, which can be used as sources of energy or as building blocks for other molecules.
7.10.0.1.0-2.9.1	Some of the G3P is used to synthesize glucose inside the chloroplast.
7.10.0.1.0-2.9.2	As the day wears on, glucose molecules accumulate and are linked together to form the polysaccharide starch.
7.10.0.1.0-2.9.3	This stored carbohydrate can then be drawn on during the night so that the photosynthetic tissues can continue to export sucrose to the rest of the plant, even when photosynthesis is not taking place.
7.10.0.1.0-2.9.4	In addition, starch is abundant in nonphotosynthetic organs such as roots, underground stems, and seeds, where it provides glucose to fuel cellular activities, including plant growth.
7.10.0.1.0-2.10.1	The plant uses the carbohydrates produced in photosynthesis to make other molecules, including amino acids, lipids, and the building blocks of nucleic acids   in fact, all the organic molecules in the plant.
7.10.0.1.0-2.10.2	Figure 10.13 The Photochemical Reactions Stimulate the Calvin Cycle
7.10.0.1.0-2.11.1	The products of the Calvin cycle are of crucial importance to Earth&#x2019;s entire biosphere.
7.10.0.1.0-2.11.2	For the majority of living organisms on Earth, the C   C and C   H covalent bonds generated by the cycle provide almost all of the energy for life.
7.10.0.1.0-2.11.3	Photosynthetic organisms, which are also called autotrophs (&#x201C;self-feeders&#x201D;), release most of this energy by glycolysis and cellular respiration, and use it to support their own growth, development, and reproduction.
7.10.0.1.0-2.11.4	But plants are also the source of energy for other organisms.
7.10.0.1.0-2.11.5	Much plant matter ends up being consumed by heterotrophs (   other-feeders  ?), such as animals, including you, which cannot photosynthesize.
7.10.0.1.0-2.11.6	Heterotrophs depend on autotrophs for both raw materials and energy.
7.10.0.1.0-2.11.7	Free energy is released from food by glycolysis and cellular respiration in the cells of heterotrophs.
7.10.0.1.0-7.1.1	As you have seen, the Calvin cycle uses NADPH and ATP, which are generated using energy from light.
7.10.0.1.0-7.1.2	Two other processes connect the light reactions with this CO2 fixation pathway.
7.10.0.1.0-7.1.3	Both connections are indirect but significant:
7.10.0.1.0-7.2.1	Light-induced pH changes in the stroma activate some Calvin cycle enzymes.
7.10.0.1.0-7.2.2	Proton transfer from the stroma into the thylakoid lumen causes an increase in the pH of the stroma from 7 to 8 (a tenfold decrease in H+ concentration) that favors the activation of rubisco.
7.10.0.1.0-7.3.1	Light-induced electron transport reduces disulfide bridges in four of the Calvin cycle enzymes, thereby activating them (Figure 10.13).
7.10.0.1.0-7.3.2	When ferredoxin is reduced in photosystem I (see Figure 10.7), it passes some electrons to a small, soluble protein called thioredoxin, and this protein passes electrons to four enzymes in the CO2 fixation pathway.
7.10.0.1.0-7.3.3	Reduction of the sulfurs in the disulfide bridges of these enzymes (see Figure 3.5) forms SH groups and breaks the bridges.
7.10.0.1.0-7.3.4	The resulting changes in their three-dimensional shapes activate the enzymes and increase the rate at which the Calvin cycle operates.
7.10.0.1.0-7.4.1	10.3 recap
7.10.0.1.0-7.5.1	ATP and NADPH produced in the light reactions power the synthesis of carbohydrates by the Calvin cycle.
7.10.0.1.0-7.5.2	This cycle fixes CO2, reduces it, and regenerates the acceptor, RuBP, for further fixation.
7.10.0.1.0-7.6.1	learning outcomes
7.10.0.1.0-7.7.1	You should be able to:
7.10.0.1.0-7.8.1	Describe the experiment that led to identification of the steps in the Calvin cycle.
7.10.0.1.0-7.9.1	Explain how light reactions stimulate the Calvin cycle.
7.10.0.1.0-7.10.1	What experiments led to the identification of 3PG as the initial product of carbon fixation?
7.10.0.1.0-7.11.1	In what ways does light stimulate the Calvin cycle?
7.10.0.1.0-7.12.1	Both photosynthetic electron transport and the Calvin cycle stop in the dark.
7.10.0.1.0-7.12.2	Which specific reaction stops first?
7.10.0.1.0-7.12.3	Which stops next?
7.10.0.1.0-7.12.4	Continue answering the question &#x201C;Which stops next?&#x201D; until you have explained why both pathways have stopped.
7.10.0.1.0-7.13.1	Although all green plants carry out the Calvin cycle, some plants have evolved variations on, or additional steps in, the light-independent reactions.
7.10.0.1.0-7.13.2	These variations and additions have permitted plants to adapt to and thrive in certain environmental conditions.
7.10.0.1.0-7.13.3	Let&#x2019;s look at these environmental limitations and the metabolic bypasses that have evolved to circumvent them.
7.10.0.1.0-7.14.1	Chapter 10 continues with
7.10.0.1.0-7.15.1	10.4  Plants Have Adapted Photosynthesis to Environmental Conditions
7.10.4.1.1	How do some plants overcome the limitations of CO2 fixation?
7.10.4.2.1	C3 plants undergo photorespiration but C4 plants do not
7.10.4.3.1	The Evolution of CO2 Fixation Pathways
7.10.4.4.1	CAM plants also use PEP carboxylase
7.10.4.5.1	In addition to fixing CO2 during photosynthesis, rubisco can react with O2.
7.10.4.5.2	This reaction, which leads to a process called photorespiration, lowers the overall rate of CO2 fixation in some plants.
7.10.4.5.3	After examining this problem, we&#x2019;ll look at some biochemical pathways and features of plant anatomy that compensate for the limitations of rubisco.
7.10.4.6.1	focus your learning
7.10.4.7.1	C4 plants have evolved to avoid photorespiration under hot, dry conditions, whereas C3 plants have not.
7.10.4.8.1	CAM plants differ from C4 plants by separating carbon fixation from the Calvin cycle according to different times of the day.
7.10.4.1a.1.1	As its full name indicates, rubisco (ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) is an oxygenase as well as a carboxylase&#x2014;it can add O2 or CO2, respectively, to the acceptor molecule RuBP:
7.10.4.1a.2.1	Rubisco is a carboxylase when it adds CO2 to RuBP.
7.10.4.1a.3.1	Rubisco is an oxygenase when it adds O2 to RuBP.
7.10.4.1a.4.1	Think about the concentrations of O2 and CO2 in the typical air that you breathe.
7.10.4.1a.4.2	The concentration of CO2 in Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere is about 400 ppm, or 0.04%.
7.10.4.1a.4.3	The concentration of O2 in the air is about 20%.
7.10.4.1a.4.4	You would think that if there were an &#x201C;even competition&#x201D; between CO2 and O2 for rubisco that the latter, with its higher concentration, would be favored.
7.10.4.1a.4.5	But such is not the case.
7.10.4.1a.4.6	It turns out that the affinity (binding) of rubisco for CO2 is much stronger than it is for O2, so in normal air inside a leaf, CO2 fixation is favored even though the concentration of CO2 in the air is far lower than that of O2.
7.10.4.1a.4.7	It is when there is an even higher concentration of O2 in the leaf relative to outside that O2 competes with the CO2, and rubisco combines RuBP with O2 rather than with CO2.
7.10.4.1a.4.8	This oxygenase activity reduces the overall amount of CO2 that can be converted into carbohydrates, and may play a role in limiting plant growth.
7.10.4.1a.5.1	Relatively low O2 and high CO2 concentrations within the leaf favor carboxylase activity.
7.10.4.1a.6.1	Relatively high O2 and low CO2 concentrations within the leaf favor oxygenase activity.
7.10.4.1a.7.1	Under what conditions inside the leaf does the air have higher O2 and lower CO2, favoring the oxygenase activity?
7.10.4.1a.7.2	On a hot, dry day, small pores in the leaf surface called stomata close to prevent water from evaporating from the leaf (see Figure 10.1).
7.10.4.1a.7.3	But stomata closure also prevents gases from entering and leaving the leaf.
7.10.4.1a.7.4	If stomata are closed, the CO2 concentration in the leaf falls as CO2 is used up in photosynthetic reactions, and the O2 concentration rises because of these same reactions where water is used to form O2 (see Investigating Life: What is the chemistry of photosynthesis, and how will increasing CO2 in the atmosphere affect it?).
7.10.4.1a.7.5	As the ratio of CO2 to O2 falls, the oxygenase activity of rubisco is favored.
7.10.4.1a.8.1	The consequences of oxygenase activity and lower carboxylase activity are significant.
7.10.4.1a.8.2	When O2 is added to RuBP, one of the products is a two-carbon compound, phosphoglycolate: Figure 10.14 The Photorespiration Pathway
7.10.4.1a.9.1	The 3PG formed by rubisco&#x2019;s oxygenase activity enters the Calvin cycle, but the phosphoglycolate does not.
7.10.4.1a.9.2	Plants have evolved a metabolic pathway that can partially recover the carbon in phosphoglycolate.
7.10.4.1a.9.3	The phosphoglycolate is hydrolyzed to glycolate, which diffuses into peroxisomes (Figure 10.14).
7.10.4.1a.9.4	There, a series of reactions converts it into the amino acid glycine:
7.10.4.1a.10.1	The glycine then diffuses into a mitochondrion, where two glycine molecules are converted in a series of reactions into the amino acid serine, releasing CO2:
7.10.4.1a.11.1	The serine moves into the peroxisome, where it is converted to glycerate.
7.10.4.1a.11.2	The glycerate then moves into the chloroplast, where it is phosphorylated to make 3PG, which enters the Calvin cycle.
7.10.4.1a.11.3	Note that it takes two phosphoglycolate molecules from Equation 10.11 to produce the two glycines used in Equation 10.13.
7.10.4.1a.11.4	So overall:
7.10.4.1a.12.1	This pathway thus reclaims 75 percent of the carbons from phosphoglycolate for the Calvin cycle.
7.10.4.1a.12.2	In other words, the reaction of RuBP with O2 instead of CO2 reduces the net carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle by 25 percent.
7.10.4.1a.12.3	The pathway is called photorespiration because it consumes O2 and releases CO2 and because it occurs only in the light (mediated by the same enzyme activation processes that we mentioned above with regard to the Calvin cycle).
7.10.4.2a.1.1	Figure 10.15Leaf Anatomy of C3 and C4 Plants
7.10.4.2a.2.1	Plants differ in how they fix CO2, and can be distinguished as C3 or C4 plants, based on whether the first product of CO2 fixation is a three- or four-carbon molecule.
7.10.4.2a.2.2	In C3 plants such as roses, wheat, and rice, the first product is the three-carbon molecule 3PG&#x2014;as we have just described for the Calvin cycle.
7.10.4.2a.2.3	In these plants the cells of the mesophyll, which makes up the main body of the leaf, are full of chloroplasts containing rubisco (Figure 10.15A).
7.10.4.2a.2.4	On a hot day, these leaves close their stomata to conserve water, and as a result, rubisco acts as an oxygenase as well as a carboxylase, and photorespiration occurs.
7.10.4.2a.3.1	C4 plants, which include corn, sugarcane, and tropical grasses, make the four-carbon molecule oxaloacetate as the first product of CO2 fixation (Figure 10.15B).
7.10.4.2a.3.2	On a hot day, they partially close their stomata to conserve water, but their rate of photosynthesis does not fall.
7.10.4.2a.3.3	What do they do differently?
7.10.4.2a.3.4	Figure 10.16 The Anatomy and Biochemistry of C4 Carbon Fixation
7.10.4.2a.4.1	C4 plants have evolved a mechanism that increases the concentration of CO2 around the rubisco enzyme while at the same time isolating the rubisco from atmospheric O2.
7.10.4.2a.4.2	Thus in these plants the carboxylase reaction is favored over the oxygenase reaction; the Calvin cycle operates, but photorespiration does not occur.
7.10.4.2a.4.3	This mechanism involves the initial fixation of CO2 in the mesophyll cells and then the transfer of the fixed carbon (as a four-carbon molecule) to the bundle sheath cells, where the fixed CO2 is released for use in the Calvin cycle (Figure 10.16).
7.10.4.2a.4.4	The bundle sheath cells are located in the interior of the leaf where less atmospheric O2 can reach them than reaches cells near the surface of the leaf.
7.10.4.2a.5.1	The first enzyme in this C4 carbon fixation process, called PEP carboxylase, is present in the cytosols of mesophyll cells near the leaf&#x2019;s surface.
7.10.4.2a.5.2	This enzyme combines CO2 with a three-carbon acceptor compound, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), to produce the four-carbon fixation product, oxaloacetate.
7.10.4.2a.5.3	PEP carboxylase has two advantages over rubisco:
7.10.4.2a.6.1	It does not have oxygenase activity.
7.10.4.2a.7.1	It fixes CO2 even at very low CO2 levels.
7.10.4.2a.8.1	So even on a hot day when the stomata are partially closed and the ratio of O2 to CO2 rises, PEP carboxylase just keeps on fixing CO2.
7.10.4.2a.9.1	Oxaloacetate is converted to malate, which diffuses out of the mesophyll cells and into the bundle sheath cells (see Figure 10.15B).
7.10.4.2a.9.2	(Some C4 plants convert the oxaloacetate to aspartate instead of malate, but we will only discuss the malate pathway here. )
7.10.4.2a.9.3	The bundle sheath cells contain modified chloroplasts that are designed to concentrate CO2 around the rubisco.
7.10.4.2a.9.4	There, the four-carbon malate loses one carbon (is decarboxylated), forming CO2 and pyruvate.
7.10.4.2a.9.5	The latter moves back to the mesophyll cells where the three-carbon acceptor compound, PEP, is regenerated at the expense of ATP.
7.10.4.2a.9.6	So the &#x201C;expenditure&#x201D; of ATP in the mesophyll cell &#x201C;pumps up&#x201D; the CO2 concentration around rubisco in the bundle sheath cell, ensuring that rubisco will function as a carboxylase and begin the Calvin cycle.
7.10.4.2a.10.1	Under relatively cool or cloudy conditions, C3 plants have an advantage over C4 plants in that they don&#x2019;t expend energy to &#x201C;pump up&#x201D; the concentration of CO2 near rubisco.
7.10.4.2a.10.2	But this advantage begins to be outweighed under conditions that favor photorespiration, such as warmer seasons and climates.
7.10.4.2a.10.3	Under these conditions C4 plants have the advantage, especially if there is ample light to supply the extra ATP required for C4 photosynthesis.
7.10.4.2a.10.4	For example, Kentucky bluegrass is a C3 plant that thrives on lawns in April and May.
7.10.4.2a.10.5	But in the heat of summer it does not do as well, and Bermuda grass, a C4 plant, takes over the lawn.
7.10.4.2a.10.6	The same is true on a global scale for crops: C3 plants such as soybean, wheat, and barley have been adapted for human food production in temperate climates, whereas C4 plants such as corn and sugarcane originated and are still grown in the tropics.
7.10.4.3.1.1.1	C3 plants are more ancient than C4 plants.
7.10.4.3.1.1.2	Whereas C3 photosynthesis appears to have begun about 2.5 billion years ago, C4 plants appeared about 12 million years ago.
7.10.4.3.1.1.3	A possible factor in the emergence of the C4 pathway is the decline in atmospheric CO2.
7.10.4.3.1.1.4	When dinosaurs dominated Earth 100 million years ago, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was four times what it is now.
7.10.4.3.1.1.5	As CO2 levels declined thereafter, the C4 plants would have gained an advantage over their C3 counterparts in high-temperature, high-light environments.
7.10.4.3.1.2.1	As described in the opening of this chapter, atmospheric CO2 levels have been increasing over the past 200 years.
7.10.4.3.1.2.2	Currently, the level of CO2 is not enough for maximal CO2 fixation by rubisco, so photorespiration occurs, reducing the growth rates of C3 plants.
7.10.4.3.1.2.3	Under hot conditions, C4 plants are favored.
7.10.4.3.1.2.4	But if CO2 levels in the atmosphere continue to rise, the reverse will occur and C3 plants will have a comparative advantage.
7.10.4.3.1.2.5	The overall growth rates of crops such as rice and wheat should increase.
7.10.4.3.1.2.6	This may or may not translate into more food, given that other effects of the human-spurred CO2 increase (such as global climate change) will also alter Earth&#x2019;s ecosystems.
7.10.4.3a.1.1	Other plants besides the C4 plants use PEP carboxylase to fix and accumulate CO2.
7.10.4.3a.1.2	They include some water-storing plants (succulents) of the family Crassulaceae, many cacti, pineapples, and several other kinds of flowering plants.
7.10.4.3a.1.3	The CO2 metabolism of these plants is called crassulacean acid metabolism, or CAM, after the family of succulents in which it was discovered.
7.10.4.3a.1.4	CAM is much like the metabolism of C4 plants in that CO2 is initially fixed into a four-carbon compound.
7.10.4.3a.1.5	But in CAM plants the initial CO2 fixation and the Calvin cycle are separated in time rather than space.
7.10.4.3a.2.1	At night, when it is cooler and water loss is minimized, the stomata open.
7.10.4.3a.2.2	CO2 is fixed in mesophyll cells to form the four-carbon compound oxaloacetate, which is converted into malate and stored in the vacuole.
7.10.4.3a.3.1	During the day, when the stomata close to reduce water loss, the accumulated malate is shipped from the vacuole to the chloroplasts, where its decarboxylation supplies the CO2 for the Calvin cycle and the light reactions supply the necessary ATP and NADPH.
7.10.4.3a.4.1	10.4 recap
7.10.4.3a.5.1	Rubisco catalyzes the carboxylation of RuBP to form two 3PG, and the oxygenation of RuBP to form one 3PG and one phosphoglycolate.
7.10.4.3a.5.2	The diversion of rubisco to its oxygenase function decreases net CO2 fixation.
7.10.4.3a.5.3	C4 photosynthesis and CAM allow plants to fix CO2 under warm, dry conditions when stomata are closed and CO2 entry into the leaf is limited.
7.10.4.3a.6.1	learning outcomes
7.10.4.3a.7.1	You should be able to:
7.10.4.3a.8.1	Explain how and why C4 plants maintain a high concentration of CO2 around rubisco.
7.10.4.3a.9.1	Explain how CAM plants carry out carbon fixation separately from Calvin cycle reactions.
7.10.4.3a.10.1	How do C4 plants keep the concentration of CO2 around rubisco high, and why?
7.10.4.3a.11.1	Describe CAM plants and explain how they can temporally segregate CO2 fixation from the Calvin cycle.
7.10.4.3a.12.1	Table 10.1 compares photosynthesis in C3, C4, and CAM plants.
7.10.4.3a.12.2	Now that you understand how photosynthesis produces carbohydrates, let&#x2019;s see how the pathways of photosynthesis are connected to other metabolic pathways.
7.10.4.3a.13.1	Chapter 10 continues with
7.10.4.3a.14.1	10.5  Photosynthesis Is an Integral Part of Plant Metabolism
7.10.5.1.1	Photosynthesis interacts with other metabolic pathways
7.10.5.2.1	Green plants are autotrophs and can synthesize all the molecules they need from simple starting materials: CO2, H2O, phosphate, sulfate, ammonium ions (NH4+), and small quantities of other mineral nutrients.
7.10.5.2.2	Plants use the carbohydrates generated in photosynthesis to provide energy for processes such as active transport and anabolism.
7.10.5.2.3	Both cellular respiration and fermentation can occur in plants, although the former is far more common.
7.10.5.2.4	Unlike photosynthesis, plant cellular respiration occurs all the time in both the light and the dark.
7.10.5.3.1	focus your learning
7.10.5.4.1	Photosynthesis is linked to cellular respiration, gluconeogenesis, and other metabolic pathways.
7.10.5.5.1	Photosynthesis is responsible for providing the energy needed by most organisms on Earth.
7.10.5.1.1.1	Figure 10.17 Metabolic Interactions in a Plant Cell
7.10.5.1.2.1	Photosynthesis and respiration are closely linked through the Calvin cycle (Figure 10.17).
7.10.5.1.2.2	The partitioning of G3P, the product of the Calvin cycle, is particularly important:
7.10.5.1.3.1	Some G3P from the Calvin cycle enters glycolysis and is converted into pyruvate in the cytosol.
7.10.5.1.3.2	This pyruvate can be used in cellular respiration for energy, or its carbon skeletons can be used in anabolic reactions to make lipids, proteins, and other carbohydrates (see Figure 9.13).
7.10.5.1.4.1	Some G3P can enter a pathway that is the reverse of glycolysis (gluconeogenesis; see Key Concept 9.5).
7.10.5.1.4.2	In this case, hexose phosphates (hexose P) and then sucrose are formed and transported to the nonphotosynthetic tissues of the plant (such as the root).
7.10.5.1.5.1	Energy flows from sunlight to reduced carbon in photosynthesis, then to ATP in respiration.
7.10.5.1.5.2	Energy can also be stored in the bonds of macromolecules such as polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins.
7.10.5.1.5.3	For a plant to grow, energy storage (as body structures) must exceed energy release; that is, overall carbon fixation by photosynthesis must exceed respiration.
7.10.5.1.5.4	This principle is the basis of the ecological *food chain, as you will see in later chapters.
7.10.5.1.5.5	The products of the Calvin cycle are used in the reactions of cellular respiration (glycolysis and the citric acid cycle).
7.10.5.1.6.1	*connect the concepts Chapter 57 describes the sequence of energy flow through a community, including food chains and food webs.
7.10.5.1.6.2	Figure 10.18 Energy Losses in Photosynthesis
7.10.5.1.7.1	Photosynthesis provides most of the energy that we need for life.
7.10.5.1.7.2	Given the uncertainties about the future of photosynthesis (because of changes in CO2 levels and climate change), it would be wise to seek ways to improve photosynthetic efficiency.
7.10.5.1.7.3	Figure 10.18 shows the various ways in which solar energy is used by plants or lost.
7.10.5.1.7.4	In essence, only about 5 percent of the sunlight that reaches Earth is converted into plant growth.
7.10.5.1.7.5	The inefficiencies of photosynthesis involve basic chemistry and physics (some light energy is not absorbed by photosynthetic pigments) as well as biology (plant anatomy and leaf exposure, the oxygenase reaction of rubisco, and inefficiencies in metabolic pathways).
7.10.5.1.7.6	While it is hard to change chemistry and physics, biologists might be able to use their knowledge of plants to improve on the basic biology of photosynthesis.
7.10.5.1.7.7	This could result in a more efficient use of resources and better food production.
7.10.5.1.8.1	investigatinglife
7.10.5.1.9.1	what is the chemistry of photosynthesis, and how will it be affected by rising atmospheric CO2
7.10.5.1.10.1	Crops could be affected by increased atmospheric CO2 in multiple ways.
7.10.5.1.10.2	Higher CO2 levels generally lead to increased photosynthesis.
7.10.5.1.10.3	This is especially true for C3 plants, which are more sensitive than C4 plants to CO2 levels.
7.10.5.1.10.4	Because increased photosynthesis leads to greater plant growth, C3 crops such as wheat and rice will tend to grow more.
7.10.5.1.10.5	However, it is unclear whether this growth will be in the vegetative parts of the plant (stems and leaves) or in the part we eat (grain).
7.10.5.1.10.6	To further complicate matters, such increases in plant growth may be counteracted by the effects of increased CO2 on climate.
7.10.5.1.10.7	For example, increased temperatures would increase the rate of photosynthesis and extend the growing season, but might alter rainfall patterns.
7.10.5.1.10.8	In some areas of the world there might be less rain, and this could limit plant growth.
7.10.5.1.11.1	Future directions
7.10.5.1.12.1	As the human population rises and land for farming is limited, we are challenged to improve the productivity of crops.
7.10.5.1.12.2	A significant increase in overall crop productivity would have global consequences.
7.10.5.1.12.3	Increased atmospheric CO2 will not have a great effect on C4 plants.
7.10.5.1.12.4	But the C4 pathway accounts for about 25 percent of all net carbon fixed.
7.10.5.1.12.5	Some important species, such as corn, sorghum, and sugarcane, have the C4 pathway, but the major grain crops such as rice do not.
7.10.5.1.12.6	An intensive research program is under way to understand the genetic control of the development of the C4 pathway, including not just the enzymes involved but also how the distinctive leaf anatomy develops.
7.10.5.1.12.7	This research may lead to greater use of the C4 pathway, and its related increase in productivity in more plant species in a higher-CO2 world.

7.10.summary.2.1	Photosynthesis Uses Light to Make Carbohydrate
7.10.summary.3.1	In the process of photosynthesis, the energy of sunlight is  captured and used to convert CO2 into more complex carbon- containing compounds.
7.10.summary.3.2	See Animation 10.1
7.10.summary.4.1	Isotope-labeling experiments demonstrated that water is the source of the oxygen atoms in the O2 produced by photosynthesis.
7.10.summary.4.2	Review Investigating Life: What is the chemistry of photosynthesis, and how will increasing CO2 in the atmosphere affect it?
7.10.summary.5.1	Plants, algae, and cyanobacteria live in aerobic environments and carry out oxygenic photosynthesis: the conversion of CO2 and H2O into carbohydrates and release of O2.
7.10.summary.6.1	Some bacteria that live in anaerobic environments carry out anoxygenic photosynthesis, in which energy from the sun is used to fix CO2 without the use of H2O and the production of O2.
7.10.summary.7.1	The light reactions of photosynthesis convert light energy into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH.
7.10.summary.7.2	Review Focus: Key Figure 10.2
7.10.summary.8.1	The light-independent reactions do not use light directly but instead use ATP and NADPH to reduce CO2, forming carbohydrates. 10.2
7.10.summary.9.1	Photosynthesis Converts Light Energy into Chemical Energy
7.10.summary.10.1	Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation.
7.10.summary.10.2	It is emitted in  particle-like packets called photons but has wavelike properties.
7.10.summary.11.1	Molecules that absorb light in the visible spectrum are called  pigments.
7.10.summary.11.2	Photosynthetic organisms have several pigments,  most notably chlorophylls.
7.10.summary.12.1	Absorption of a photon puts an electron of a pigment molecule in an excited state that has more energy than its ground state.
7.10.summary.13.1	Each pigment has a characteristic absorption spectrum.
7.10.summary.13.2	An action spectrum reflects the rate of photosynthesis carried out by a photosynthetic organism at a given wavelength of light.
7.10.summary.13.3	Review Figure 10.4
7.10.summary.14.1	The pigments in photosynthetic organisms are arranged into light-harvesting complexes that absorb energy from light and funnel this energy to chlorophyll a molecules in the reaction center of the photosystem.
7.10.summary.14.2	Chlorophyll can act as a reducing agent, transferring excited electrons to other molecules.
7.10.summary.14.3	Review Figure 10.6
7.10.summary.15.1	Noncyclic electron transport uses photosystems I and II to produce ATP, NADPH, and O2.
7.10.summary.15.2	Cyclic electron transport uses only photosystem I and produces only ATP.
7.10.summary.15.3	Both systems generate ATP via the electron transport system.
7.10.summary.15.4	Review Figures 10.7, 10.8
7.10.summary.16.1	Chemiosmosis is the mechanism of ATP production in photophosphorylation.
7.10.summary.16.2	Review Figure 10.9, Animation 10.2 10.3
7.10.summary.17.1	Chemical Energy Trapped in Photosynthesis Is Used to Synthesize Carbohydrates
7.10.summary.18.1	The Calvin cycle makes carbohydrates from CO2.
7.10.summary.18.2	The cycle consists of three processes: fixation of CO2, reduction and carbohydrate production, and regeneration of RuBP.
7.10.summary.18.3	See Animation 10.3
7.10.summary.19.1	RuBP is the initial CO2 acceptor, and 3PG is the first stable product of CO2 fixation.
7.10.summary.19.2	The enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco) catalyzes the reaction of CO2 and RuBP to form 3PG.
7.10.summary.19.3	Review Figures 10.10, 10.11
7.10.summary.20.1	ATP and NADPH formed by the light reactions are used in the reduction of 3PG to form glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P).
7.10.summary.20.2	Review Figure 10.12, Activity 10.1
7.10.summary.21.1	Light stimulates enzymes in the Calvin cycle, further integrating the light-dependent and light-independent pathways.
7.10.summary.21.2	Review Figure 10.13 10.4
7.10.summary.22.1	Plants Have Adapted Photosynthesis to Environmental Conditions
7.10.summary.23.1	Rubisco can catalyze a reaction between O2 and RuBP in addition to the reaction between CO2 and RuBP.
7.10.summary.23.2	At high temperatures and low CO2 concentrations, the oxygenase function of rubisco is favored over its carboxylase function.
7.10.summary.24.1	The oxygenase reaction catalyzed by rubisco significantly reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis.
7.10.summary.24.2	The subsequent reactions of photorespiration recover some of the fixed carbon that otherwise would be lost.
7.10.summary.24.3	Review Figure 10.14
7.10.summary.25.1	In C4 plants, CO2 reacts with phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to form a four-carbon intermediate in mesophyll cells.
7.10.summary.25.2	The four-carbon product releases its CO2 to rubisco in the bundle sheath cells in the interior of the leaf.
7.10.summary.25.3	Review Figures 10.15, 10.16, Activity 10.2
7.10.summary.26.1	Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants operate much like C4 plants, but their initial CO2 fixation by PEP carboxylase is temporally separated from the Calvin cycle, rather than spatially separated as in C4 plants. 10.5
7.10.summary.27.1	Photosynthesis Is an Integral Part of Plant Metabolism
7.10.summary.28.1	Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are linked through the Calvin cycle, the citric acid cycle, and glycolysis.
7.10.summary.28.2	Review Figure 10.17
7.10.summary.29.1	To survive, a plant must photosynthesize more than it respires.
7.10.summary.30.1	Photosynthesis uses only a small portion of the energy of sunlight.

7.10.summary.36.1	Some plants are shade-tolerant, and others thrive in sunlight.
7.10.summary.36.2	This phenomenon raises questions, because all plants use the same basic photosynthetic process.
7.10.summary.36.3	What makes shade-tolerant plants different from shade-intolerant plants, allowing them to grow well in low light?
7.10.summary.36.4	Can plants adapt to cope with unfavorable lighting conditions?
7.10.summary.37.1	Researchers explored these questions by studying seedlings of two tree species   one shade-tolerant (beech) and one shade-intolerant (quaking aspen).
7.10.summary.37.2	The researchers planted newly germinated seedlings of both species under frames and covered the frames with shade cloth, limiting the amount of sunlight getting through to either 3% or 44% of normal daylight.
7.10.summary.38.1	After 5 weeks the researchers moved one leaf, still attached to each plant, out of the frame so it could be studied briefly.
7.10.summary.38.2	They exposed each leaf to varying light intensities for several minutes, while measuring the rate of photosynthesis in its cells.
7.10.summary.38.3	Then leaves were removed and analyzed for chlorophyll content by mass, density of chlorophyll in the leaf, and leaf surface area.
7.10.summary.38.4	The last measurement was expressed as surface area per gram of leaf tissue so that the two species, which have different leaf sizes, could be compared.
7.10.summary.38.5	The results are shown in the graphs at right and in the table below.

7.39.1.1	Chapter 39: Physiology, Homeostasis, and Temperature Regulation
7.39.2.1	Paula Radcliffe, photographed here during her winning performance at the 2005 London Marathon, collapsed from heat stress during the 2004 Olympic marathon.
7.39.2.2	When the body is subjected to extreme heat, its homeostatic mechanisms may fail.

7.39.10.1	Heat Limits Physical Performance
7.39.11.1	The 2008 New York City Marathon took place on a cold, clear, windy day in November.
7.39.11.2	For the third time, the first-place woman in this 41-kilometer race was world record holder Paula Radcliffe.
7.39.11.3	Radcliffe had also been expected to win the women's marathon in the 2004 Olympics.
7.39.11.4	But that race took place on an extremely hot (high of 34  C), humid day in Athens.
7.39.11.5	Overcome by heat stress, Radcliffe collapsed 6 kilometers from the finish line.
7.39.12.1	Elite runners generally have their best times when temperatures are below 10  C. The 2012 Boston Marathon coincided with an unseasonable April heat wave, with temperatures exceeding 27  C. During the race, 120 runners were rushed to hospitals with severe heat stress.
7.39.13.1	When a person's internal body temperature rises above 40  C, major organs begin to fail, a condition known as heat stroke.
7.39.13.2	Every year some athletes suffer heat stroke, which leads to death in a high percentage of cases.
7.39.13.3	Soldiers in desert environments are at extreme risk of heat stroke, as are workers in many occupations, including firefighting, agriculture, and construction.
7.39.14.1	Heat stroke is a particular danger for those who are active in the heat because working muscles generate heat.
7.39.14.2	The blood carries that heat out of the muscles and distributes it throughout the body, raising the temperature of the body's internal tissues.
7.39.14.3	Some of the heated blood flows to the skin, where heat can be lost to the environment, but humans are subject to the problems faced by all mammals in losing excess heat.
7.39.14.4	First, their normal internal temperatures are not far from the environmental temperatures that cause heat stress, so they don't have much of a safety zone.
7.39.14.5	Second, most mammalian skin surfaces are covered with an insulating layer of fur   great for conserving body heat in cold environments, but an impediment to heat loss in warm ones.
7.39.14.6	Even human skin is an insulator.
7.39.15.1	A major evolutionary adaptation in mammals for heat loss is efficient heat-loss portals of non-furred areas such as the nose, tongue, and footpads.
7.39.15.2	In these areas, specialized blood vessels can open up and act like radiators to disperse heat (conversely, these portals can close down to conserve heat).
7.39.15.3	Humans are not furred, but our evolutionary ancestors were, and we retain these mammalian blood vessel adaptations in our hands, feet, and face (which is why we blush).
7.39.16.1	How can we increase heat loss from the body to protect against heat stress?
7.39.17.1	Chapter 39 continues with
7.39.18.1	39.1 Animals Are Composed of Organs Built from Four Types of Tissues
7.39.1.1.1	How would you build a multicellular animal?
7.39.1.2.1	There are advantages and challenges to getting bigger
7.39.1.3.1	There are four tissue types
7.39.1.4.1	Organs are built from multiple tissues
7.39.1.5.1	Animals are amazing in all they do to survive, thrive, and propagate.
7.39.1.5.2	They live in environments that could not support single cells, they extract energy from the environment, they build complex molecules and structures, they alter their environments, and they reproduce.
7.39.1.5.3	All of these feats and more depend on complex body components that have evolved since the first appearance of multicellular organisms on this planet.
7.39.1.5.4	What does it take to be an animal?
7.39.1.6.1	focus your learning
7.39.1.7.1	Multicellularity enabled the evolution of organisms that are much larger than single-celled organisms can be.
7.39.1.8.1	Organs are composed of four tissue types.
7.39.1.1.1.1	This might seem like a silly question; even bioengineers don't build animals.
7.39.1.1.1.2	But as you begin to study animal form and function, or animal physiology, it is instructive to think of all of the problems animals must solve to survive.
7.39.1.1.1.3	For example: they must:
7.39.1.1.2.1	extract energy and nutrients from the environment.
7.39.1.1.3.1	build all of the internal structures they need.
7.39.1.1.4.1	eliminate toxins and metabolic waste products.
7.39.1.1.5.1	sense the environment and respond to it in various ways, including movement.
7.39.1.1.6.1	maintain constant conditions in their internal environments.
7.39.1.1.7.1	reproduce.
7.39.1.1.8.1	Single- and multicellular organisms have evolved to conquer these challenges.
7.39.1.1.8.2	In fact, single-celled organisms are remarkably abundant and thrive in widely diverse environments.
7.39.1.1.8.3	Multicellular organisms have evolved complex body systems to conquer the same challenges.
7.39.1.1.8.4	Given the success of single-celled organisms, why have multicellular animals evolved?
7.39.1.1.8.5	How is it advantageous to be multi-cellular?
7.39.1.1.8.6	Multicellularity confers two advantages&#8212;large size and the opportunity for cells to specialize.
7.39.1.2.1.1	Advantages to being bigger include being able to prey on other organisms and also being able to resist or work against forces in the environment, such as wave forces in reefs.
7.39.1.2.1.2	There is a problem, however, that limits how big single-celled organisms can get.
7.39.1.2.1.3	All exchanges with the environment, such as uptake of nutrients and elimination of wastes, occur across the cell membrane, so the extent of these exchanges is limited by the surface area of the cell membrane. *Cell surface area increases with the square of the linear dimension of the cell, but the needs of the cell increase as a function of the volume of the cell, which is a function of the cube of the linear dimension.
7.39.1.2.1.4	Thus there is a size limit beyond which single-celled organisms cannot satisfy their needs.
7.39.1.2.2.1	*connect the concepts Figure 5.2 illustrates how cell volume grows faster than cell surface area as cells get bigger.
7.39.1.2.3.1	Cell specialization is essential for multicellular animals to grow bigger.
7.39.1.2.3.2	If a multicellular animal consists of only a few layers of cells, those cells can carry out their own exchanges directly with the environment.
7.39.1.2.3.3	A good example is a sponge (Figure 39.1).
7.39.1.2.3.4	Bigger organisms have cells that are not in contact with the external environment.
7.39.1.2.3.5	The needs of those cells must be supplied by an internal environment&#8212;extracellular fluid that bathes all the cells of the animal's body.
7.39.1.2.3.6	Different cells and groups of cells must be specialized to contribute to the maintenance of that internal environment.
7.39.1.2.3.7	Thus each cell contributes to the internal environment, and each cell is supported by that internal environment.
7.39.1.2.3.8	Figure 39.1 No Cell Too Far
7.39.1.2.4.1	Cell specializations have tremendous adaptive value for even the simplest multicellular animals.
7.39.1.2.4.2	Some cells can be specialized for movement, some for intake of food, and some for reproduction.
7.39.1.2.4.3	But evolving a specialized function usually comes at the expense of other cellular functions, which may be lost or at least compromised.
7.39.1.2.4.4	The specialized cells of an organism thus engage in a kind of collaborative enterprise by providing services for all of the cells of the organism in return for different services provided by other cells.
7.39.1.2.4.5	Thus the cells specialized for movement do not have to also capture and process food, and the reproductive cells do not have to move the whole animal to find a mate.
7.39.1.2.4.6	For example, male sex cells are motile cells that are good at seeking out nonmotile female sex cells, but the male sex cells have lost the ability to do many other cell functions such as acquire and process food.
7.39.1.3.1.1	Specialized cells rarely function alone, but rather as groups of similar cells called tissues.
7.39.1.3.1.2	There are many different kinds of cells, but they are all classified as one of four tissue types: epithelial, muscle, connective, and nervous (Focus: Key Figure 39.2):
7.39.1.3.2.1	focus: key figure
7.39.1.3.3.1	Figure 39.2 How to Build an Animal
7.39.1.3.4.1	Tissues are the building blocks.
7.39.1.3.5.1	Q: If we consider the functions of skeletal muscle in running, what are roles played by the three other tissue types in this process?
7.39.1.3.6.1	Epithelial tissues are sheets of cells that create barriers between different compartments and frequently have secretory functions.
7.39.1.3.7.1	Muscle tissues contract to generate forces and movement.
7.39.1.3.8.1	Connective tissues provide structure and support.
7.39.1.3.9.1	Nervous tissues convey and process information.
7.39.1.3.10.1	These are very general groupings that reflect developmental origins, but within each group there are various specializations that accommodate different functions.
7.39.1.3.10.2	For example, connective tissue includes bones, cartilage, fat, and blood.
7.39.1.3.10.3	Epithelial tissue includes the outer layers of skin (epidermis) and many types of secretory cells that produce and release substances internally, such as hormones, and externally, such as sweat and digestive juices.
7.39.1.3.10.4	You might think of digestive juices as being secreted internally, but the lumen of the digestive tract is continuous with the external environment.
7.39.1.3.10.5	You will learn a lot about the diversity of functions accomplished through specializations of these four tissue types in the chapters that follow.
7.39.1.4.1.1	Organs are internal structures that carry out specific functions.
7.39.1.4.1.2	An organ is composed of an outer covering, or epithelium, and one or more other kinds of tissues.
7.39.1.4.1.3	Indeed, most organs include all four tissue types.
7.39.1.4.1.4	The gut (digestive tract) is a good example (Figure 39.3).
7.39.1.4.1.5	Its inner surface is lined with a sheet of columnar epithelial cells.
7.39.1.4.1.6	Different types of epithelial cells in this lining secrete hormones or digestive juices or absorb nutrients from the gut.
7.39.1.4.1.7	Beneath the epithelial lining is a layer of connective tissue called the mucosa.
7.39.1.4.1.8	Within this connective tissue are blood vessels, neurons, and glands (clusters of secretory epithelial cells).
7.39.1.4.1.9	Concentric layers of smooth muscle tissue enable the gut to contract to mix food with digestive juices.
7.39.1.4.1.10	A network of neurons between the muscle layers controls these movements.
7.39.1.4.1.11	Figure 39.3 Tissues Form Organs
7.39.1.4.2.1	An individual organ is usually part of an organ system, a group of organs that work together to carry out certain functions.
7.39.1.4.2.2	The stomach, small intestine, liver, and pancreas, for example, are parts of the digestive system.
7.39.1.4.2.3	The structure of an animal involves an organizational hierarchy.
7.39.1.4.2.4	Cells form tissues, tissues form organs, organs work together as organ systems, and all work together as a multicellular organism.
7.39.1.4.3.1	39.1 recap
7.39.1.4.4.1	There are limits to how large cells can be because metabolic needs are related to cell volume, and abilities to satisfy those needs are determined by cell surface area.
7.39.1.4.4.2	Cell volume grows faster than cell surface area.
7.39.1.4.4.3	Multicellularity and cell specialization enabled organisms to grow larger.
7.39.1.4.4.4	Groups of similar cells form tissues, and multicellular animals are composed of four tissue types: epithelial, connective, nervous, and muscle.

7.39.2.1.1	The internal environment is the extracellular fluid that serves all the needs of the cells of the body
7.39.2.2.1	Physiological systems are regulated to maintain homeostasis
7.39.2.3.1	The evolution of multicellularity made it possible to enclose and therefore create an internal fluid environment that bathed all cells of the organism.
7.39.2.3.2	Since that internal environment provided for all of the needs of the individual cells, individual cell lines could become specialized as to what they contributed to the internal environment.
7.39.2.3.3	Just as with people, specialization in one function usually goes hand in hand with losses in other functions.
7.39.2.3.4	But those functional losses in each cell line were compensated for by the constancy of the internal environment.
7.39.2.3.5	The evolution of organs composed of multiple tissues and the evolution of informational systems to control organ activities improved the abilities of animals to maintain a constant internal environment.
7.39.2.3.6	In essence, the evolution of physiological systems to maintain various aspects of the internal environment made it possible for multicellular animals to become larger, and more complex, and allowed them to occupy many different environments.
7.39.2.4.1	focus your learning
7.39.2.5.1	The needs of cells in the multicellular animal are served through exchanges with the internal environment, which consists of the extracellular fluid.
7.39.2.6.1	Homeostasis of the internal environment is maintained through control and regulation of activities of organs and organ systems.
7.39.2.1.1.1	Individual cells get their nutrients from the surrounding extracellular fluid (ECF) and dump their waste products into it.
7.39.2.1.1.2	A human is about 60 percent water.
7.39.2.1.1.3	Two-thirds of that water is intracellular fluid and one-third is the ECF.
7.39.2.1.1.4	About 20 percent of the ECF (about 3 liters) is the blood plasma that circulates in our blood vessels.
7.39.2.1.1.5	The remaining 80 percent (about 11 liters) is the interstitial fluid that bathes every cell of the body (Figure 39.4).
7.39.2.1.1.6	Water and small molecules freely exchange between the interstitial fluid and the blood plasma.
7.39.2.1.1.7	Thus nutrients move into the interstitial fluid from the blood plasma, and wastes move into the blood plasma from the interstitial fluid.
7.39.2.1.1.8	As long as the composition and physical conditions of the interstitial fluid are held within certain limits, cells are protected from the changes and harsh conditions of the external environment.
7.39.2.1.1.9	A stable internal environment makes it possible for an animal to occupy habitats that would kill its cells if they were directly exposed to the external conditions.
7.39.2.1.1.10	How is the internal environment kept constant?
7.39.2.1.2.1	Figure 39.4 The Internal Environment
7.39.2.1.3.1	The constant composition of the internal environment is always being challenged by the external environment and by the metabolic activities of the cells of the body.
7.39.2.1.3.2	Organisms must maintain their internal environment in a state of homeostasis&#8212;a narrow range of stable and optimal physical and biochemical conditions.
7.39.2.1.3.3	If a physiological system fails to function properly, homeostasis is compromised, and cells are damaged and can die.
7.39.2.1.3.4	To avoid the loss of homeostasis, organ systems are controlled and regulated in response to changes in both the external and internal environments.
7.39.2.1.3.5	The maintenance of homeostasis is a central theme of physiology.
7.39.2.2.1.1	The activities of physiological systems are controlled&#8212;speeded up or slowed down&#8212;by actions of the nervous and endocrine systems.
7.39.2.2.1.2	But to regulate these systems and maintain homeostasis, information is required.
7.39.2.2.1.3	As an analogy, think of the thermostat that controls the furnace and air conditioner to regulate the temperature of a house (Figure 39.5).
7.39.2.2.1.4	The desired temperature is a set point, or reference point on the thermostat.
7.39.2.2.1.5	The thermostat acts as a comparator by sensing the current temperature in the house and comparing that value to the set point.
7.39.2.2.1.6	Thus the sensing of the air temperature is feedback information.
7.39.2.2.1.7	Any difference between the set point and feedback information results in an error signal.
7.39.2.2.1.8	The error signal is converted into commands to the furnace or air conditioner, turning them on or off.
7.39.2.2.2.1	Figure 39.5 A Thermostat Regulates Temperature
7.39.2.2.3.1	Regulatory systems such as a building thermostat or one of the many physiological regulatory systems described in this book obtain, process, and integrate information.
7.39.2.2.3.2	Regulatory systems use that information to issue commands to effectors such as muscles or glands that effect changes in the internal environment.
7.39.2.2.3.3	Effectors are also called controlled systems because their activities are controlled by the neural or hormonal signals from their respective regulatory systems.
7.39.2.2.3.4	Important components of any regulatory system are the sensors such as light-, temperature-, and pressure-sensitive cells that provide feedback information to be compared with internal set points.
7.39.2.2.4.1	Negative feedback is information used to counteract the influence that created an error signal.
7.39.2.2.4.2	Whatever force is pushing the system away from its set point must be &#8220;negated. &#8221; In our thermostat analogy, an air temperature below the set point causes the furnace to be turned on, which then reverses the direction of change in the air temperature.
7.39.2.2.5.1	Although not as common as negative feedback, positive feedback also exists in physiological systems.
7.39.2.2.5.2	Rather than returning a system to a set point, positive feedback amplifies a response (i. e. , it increases the deviation from the set point).
7.39.2.2.5.3	An example is sexual behavior, in which a little stimulation causes more behavior, which causes more stimulation, and so on.
7.39.2.2.5.4	Positive feedback responses tend to reach a limit and terminate rapidly.
7.39.2.2.5.5	The birth process is a good example.
7.39.2.2.5.6	Contractions of the uterus push the baby into the birth canal, and stretching of the birth canal stimulates more and stronger contractions until the baby is delivered, at which time contractions cease.
7.39.2.2.6.1	Feedforward information is another feature of regulatory systems.
7.39.2.2.6.2	Its function is to change the set point in anticipation of a change in conditions.
7.39.2.2.6.3	The timer on a thermostat provides feedforward information by changing the system's temperature set point, usually lowering it in the evening and raising it in the morning.
7.39.2.2.6.4	Hearing the words &#8220;on your mark&#8221; before a race is feedforward information that raises your heart rate in anticipation of running.
7.39.2.2.6.5	Feedforward information anticipates a change in the internal environment before that change occurs.
7.39.2.2.7.1	39.2 recap
7.39.2.2.8.1	The internal environment provides for the needs of all the cells that make up a complex multicellular animal.
7.39.2.2.8.2	Organs and organ systems control the composition of the internal environment so as to maintain homeostasis.
7.39.2.2.8.3	The activities of organs and organ systems are regulated.
7.39.2.2.8.4	Regulation requires information about optimal conditions (set points) and existing conditions (feedback) to create commands to effector cells and organs.
7.39.2.2.9.1	learning outcomes
7.39.2.2.10.1	You should be able to:
7.39.2.2.11.1	Explain why homeostasis of the internal environment in a multicellular animal is critical to the animal's survival.
7.39.2.2.12.1	Use knowledge about fluid compartments in the human body to perform analyses.
7.39.2.2.13.1	Differentiate between negative feedback, positive feedback, and feedforward control mechanisms.
7.39.2.2.14.1	Why is maintenance of the internal environment considered to be the primary focus of physiology?
7.39.2.2.15.1	Explain the differences between negative and positive feedback and feedforward control mechanisms.
7.39.2.2.16.1	Based on your body mass, estimate how much water is in your body.
7.39.2.2.16.2	What is your intracellular fluid volume, your extracellular fluid volume, and your blood plasma volume?
7.39.2.2.17.1	Principles of control and regulation help organize our thinking about physiological systems.
7.39.2.2.17.2	Once we understand how a system works, we can then ask how it is regulated.
7.39.2.2.17.3	Part Nine of this book describes various physiological systems, how they function, and how they are regulated.
7.39.2.2.17.4	We begin by extending our example of a house thermo-regulatory system to that of the mammalian body.
7.39.2.2.18.1	Chapter 39 continues with
7.39.2.2.19.1	39.3 Biological Processes Are Temperature-Sensitive
7.39.3.1.1	Temperature affects living systems
7.39.3.2.1	Q10 is a measure of temperature sensitivity
7.39.3.3.1	Animals acclimatize to seasonal temperatures
7.39.3.4.1	Small changes in temperature can have large physiological effects
7.39.3.5.1	Temperatures of environments where organisms live vary enormously, from the boiling hot springs of Yellowstone National Park to the interior of Antarctica, where the temperature can fall below &#8722;80&#0176;C.
7.39.3.5.2	But in general, cells can function over only a narrow range of temperatures.
7.39.3.5.3	The evolution of thermoregulatory adaptations enables maintenance of suitable thermal conditions in the internal environment.
7.39.3.6.1	focus your learning
7.39.3.7.1	Cells can survive only within a small range of the temperatures that occur on Earth.
7.39.3.8.1	Q10 values are measures of temperature sensitivity of biochemical reactions or physiological processes.
7.39.3.9.1	Temperature acclimatization allows animals to shift their metabolic rates as they experience seasonal changes in external temperatures.
7.39.3.10.1	Metabolic acclimatization enables animals to adapt to seasonal temperature changes.
7.39.3.1.1.1	Figure 39.6 Frozen Frogs
7.39.3.1.2.1	If cells cool below the freezing point of their body fluids, ice crystals form and damage cell structures.
7.39.3.1.2.2	Some animals have adaptations, such as antifreeze molecules in their blood that help them resist freezing; others can survive freezing (Figure 39.6).
7.39.3.1.2.3	Generally, however, cells must remain above freezing to stay alive.
7.39.3.1.2.4	The upper temperature limit for survival in most cells is about 45&#0176;C because of protein denaturation.
7.39.3.1.2.5	Some specialized algae, however, can grow in hot springs at 70&#0176;C, and some archaea live at near 100&#0176;C.
7.39.3.1.3.1	*connect the concepts Protein denaturation by heat is due to effects on secondary and tertiary structure of the protein as described in Key Concept 3.2.
7.39.3.1.4.1	Although the survival limits for most cells fall in the range of 0&#0176;C&#8211;40&#0176;C, most species have much narrower thermal limits for optimal function.
7.39.3.1.4.2	To stay within those limits in spite of environmental conditions, animals have thermoregulatory adaptations that enable them to tolerate extreme conditions or to control their body temperature in spite of environmental conditions.
7.39.3.1.4.3	These adaptations may determine the thermal tolerances of species and thereby determine their geographic ranges.
7.39.3.1.4.4	When environments change rapidly, as is happening globally at present, animals may find themselves in situations that exceed their thermal tolerances.
7.39.3.1.4.5	A good example is the reef-building corals discussed in the opening of Chapter 1.
7.39.3.2.1.1	Even between 0&#0176;C and 40&#0176;C, changes in body temperature create problems for animals.
7.39.3.2.1.2	Most *biochemical reactions and the physiological processes they are involved in are temperature-sensitive, going faster at higher temperatures.
7.39.3.2.1.3	The temperature sensitivity of a reaction or process can be described in terms of Q10, a factor calculated by dividing the rate of a process or reaction at a certain temperature, RT, by the rate of that same process or reaction at a temperature 10&#0176;C lower, RT&#8722;10:
7.39.3.2.2.1	*connect the concepts As discussed in Key Concept 8.5, increases in temperature increase reaction rates because reactant molecules have more kinetic energy.
7.39.3.2.2.2	Enzymes that control rates of biochemical reactions in metabolic pathways are influenced by temperature as well.
7.39.3.2.3.1	Q10 can be measured for a simple biochemical reaction or for a complex physiological process, such as rate of oxygen consumption.
7.39.3.2.3.2	If a reaction or process is not temperature-sensitive, it has a Q10 of 1.
7.39.3.2.3.3	Most biological Q10 values are between 2 and 3.
7.39.3.2.3.4	A Q10 of 2 means that the reaction rate doubles as temperature increases by 10&#0176;C, and a Q10 of 3 indicates a tripling of the rate over a 10&#0176;C temperature range (Figure 39.7).
7.39.3.2.3.5	Figure 39.7 Q10 and Reaction Rate
7.39.3.2.4.1	Notice that the Q10 values (except for Q10 = 1) plotted in Figure 39.7 produce curves rather than straight lines.
7.39.3.2.4.2	This is because temperature increases in additive intervals (10, 20, 30, etc. ) but reaction rates increase in a multiplicative fashion (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. ).
7.39.3.2.4.3	Such curvilinear plots are common in biological data.
7.39.3.2.5.1	Changes in body temperature can disrupt an animal&#0039;s physiology because not all of the biochemical reactions that constitute the metabolism of an animal have the same Q10.
7.39.3.2.5.2	These biochemical reactions are linked together in complex networks: the products of one reaction are the reactants for other reactions.
7.39.3.2.5.3	Because different reactions have different Q10&#0039;s, changes in tissue temperature will shift the rates of some reactions more than others, disrupting the overall network.
7.39.3.2.5.4	Therefore, to maintain homeostasis, organisms compensate for or prevent changes in body temperature.
7.39.3.3.1.1	The body temperatures of some animals (especially aquatic animals) are coupled to environmental temperature.
7.39.3.3.1.2	The body temperature of a fish in a pond, for example, is the same as the water temperature, which might range from 4&#0176;C in winter to 24&#0176;C in summer.
7.39.3.3.1.3	If we bring that fish into the laboratory in the summer and measure the rates of any of its physiological or biochemical processes such as oxygen consumption, we will demonstrate a Q10 relationship.
7.39.3.3.1.4	On the basis of the Q10 relationship, we would predict that the fish&#0039;s oxygen consumption&#8212;a measure of its metabolic rate&#8212;would be lower in the winter pond because the water temperature is lower.
7.39.3.3.1.5	However, if we bring that fish back into the laboratory in the winter and measure its metabolic rate at winter pond temperature, we find that rate to be higher than we predicted.
7.39.3.3.1.6	The fish&#0039;s biochemistry and physiology will have acclimatized to the seasonal change in water temperature so that it can remain active at winter temperatures.
7.39.3.3.1.7	What could be the mechanism of this acclimatization?
7.39.3.3.1.8	Many organisms express multiple forms of enzymes (isozymes) that have different temperature optima.
7.39.3.3.1.9	In winter, organisms express the forms that show maximum substrate affinity at low temperatures, and in summer they express the forms that have maximum substrate affinity at high temperature.
7.39.3.3.1.10	Another mechanism of temperature acclimatization is a change in the composition of cell membranes designed to maintain optimum fluidity despite changes in temperature (see Key Concept 6.1).
7.39.3.3.1.11	Acclimatization in animals essentially means that their metabolic functions are less sensitive to long-term changes in their environment than to short-term changes.
7.39.3.4.1.1	The story opening this chapter described a world-class marathon runner failing to finish an important race because of heat stress.
7.39.3.4.1.2	As many of us have experienced, our ability to do hard work is reduced when we get overheated.
7.39.3.4.1.3	Because high tissue temperatures can damage cells, shutting off a muscle&#0039;s ability to do work may serve a protective function.
7.39.3.4.2.1	Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme critical for production of ATP in muscles; it catalyzes the last step in glycolysis, producing pyruvate that can enter the mitochondria and be metabolized to produce ATP (see Figure 9.12).
7.39.3.4.2.2	Without ATP, muscles fatigue.
7.39.3.4.2.3	Muscle pyruvate kinase inactivates around 40&#0176;C, which shuts off muscle function and thereby prevents thermal damage to the muscle.
7.39.3.4.2.4	The thermal inactivation of muscle pyruvate kinase is probably a protective adaptation to prevent thermal damage to the muscle.
7.39.3.4.2.5	You may thus wonder, if we could facilitate the extraction of heat from muscle, could we increase its capacity to do work?
7.39.3.4.2.6	We consider this question in Investigating Life: Can the Work Capacity of Muscle Be Increased by Extracting Heat from the Palms of the Hands?

7.39.3.4.7.1	At the beginning of the chapter you learned that mammals dissipate excess heat through their non-hairy skin areas.
7.39.3.4.7.2	Those skin areas are small, but they have special high-volume blood vessels that transfer heat from the body core to the skin.
7.39.3.4.7.3	Humans have these same blood vessel adaptations.
7.39.3.4.7.4	In this experiment, heat was extracted from the palm of a hand, and muscle work capacity was measured.
7.39.3.4.8.1	HYPOTHESIS Extracting excess heat from the body will increase the capacity of muscles to do work.
7.39.3.4.9.1	METHOD
7.39.3.4.10.1	Recruit seventeen healthy recreational athletes between the ages of 19 and 23 years old.
7.39.3.4.11.1	Instruct subjects in proper bench press technique, and determine each subject&#0039;s 1 repetition maximum (the maximum weight they could lift once).
7.39.3.4.12.1	Divide subjects into two groups (controls with no cooling and treatment with palmar cooling).
7.39.3.4.12.2	Have each group complete 5 trials of 6 sets of bench presses, until muscle failure, with the weight set to 50% of the subject&#0039;s 1 repetition maximum.
7.39.3.4.12.3	Between sets allow subjects to rest for 3 minutes, with the experimental group receiving palmar cooling and the control group receiving no cooling.
7.39.3.4.12.4	Separate trials by at least 3 days.
7.39.3.4.12.5	Record the total numbers of bench presses per trial.
7.39.3.4.13.1	Repeat the experiment with control and treatment groups switched.
7.39.3.4.14.1	RESULTS
7.39.3.4.15.1	Only results for first and last trials of each experiment are shown in the table.
7.39.3.4.16.1	CONCLUSION By working through the work with the data exercise, you will be able to conclude whether the hypothesis is supported or not supported by this experiment.

7.39.3.4.17.1	work with the data
7.39.3.4.18.1	This experiment involves a simple outcome measure: number of bench presses in 6 sets done to muscle failure.
7.39.3.4.18.2	The experimental manipulation is heat extraction from a palm between sets.
7.39.3.4.18.3	The control condition is an equivalent period of rest between sets without palmar cooling.
7.39.3.4.18.4	The main question is whether there is a difference in the  work volume when cooled versus when not cooled.
7.39.3.4.18.5	However, there are some complicating factors: (1) the subjects varied considerably in their initial work capacity, and (2) since the treatments were sequential there could be an order effect.
7.39.3.4.18.6	To minimize the order effect, the treatments were randomized as to palmar cooling or no cooling.
7.39.3.4.18.7	Your analysis must first standardize the data, then test for an order effect, and finally test for a treatment effect.
7.39.3.4.19.1	How can you standardize the data?
7.39.3.4.19.2	Because the subjects began the experiment at different ability levels, the absolute increase in repetitions cannot be used as a comparative outcome measure.
7.39.3.4.19.3	An increase of 5 repetitions is more impressive for a subject who began at 25 than for one who began at 50&#8212;a 20 percent increase in contrast to a 10 percent increase.
7.39.3.4.19.4	For each individual and each treatment it is necessary to convert the raw data to percent increase.
7.39.3.4.20.1	How can you test for a treatment effect?
7.39.3.4.20.2	Each subject was cooled in one treatment and not cooled in the other treatment.
7.39.3.4.20.3	To see if there is a difference in the percent increase due to palmar cooling, you can average the percent increases for all subjects in their cooling treatments and for all subjects in their control treatments.
7.39.3.4.20.4	Using a paired t-test, you can assess whether palmar cooling had a significant effect on the outcome.
7.39.3.4.21.1	QUESTIONS
7.39.3.4.22.1	Because this experiment involved repetitions of a physical activity, you would expect there to be a conditioning effect whether the subjects were cooled or not, and you might expect the improvements to be greater in the second treatment than in the first.
7.39.3.4.22.2	To test for an order effect, compare the percent increases for all subjects in treatment 1 to the percent increases for all subjects in treatment 2.
7.39.3.4.22.3	For statistical analysis use a paired t-test (see Appendix B).
7.39.3.4.22.4	What do you conclude about a possible order effect in your collection of data?
7.39.3.4.23.1	Each subject was cooled in one treatment and not cooled in the other treatment.
7.39.3.4.23.2	To see if there is a difference in the percent increase due to palmar cooling, average the percent increases for all subjects in their cooling treatments and for all subjects in their control treatments.
7.39.3.4.23.3	Using a paired t-test, you can assess whether palmar cooling had a significant effect on the outcome.
7.39.3.4.23.4	What do you conclude about a treatment effect in your experimental results?
7.39.3.4.24.1	Is the hypothesis supported or disproven?
7.39.3.4.24.2	Explain.
7.39.3.4.25.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.39.3.4.26.1	39.3 recap
7.39.3.4.27.1	Cells can survive only within a narrow range of temperatures, but even changes within that range can be disruptive because different physiological processes have different temperature sensitivities.
7.39.3.4.28.1	learning outcomes
7.39.3.4.29.1	You should be able to:
7.39.3.4.30.1	Explain why animals&#0039; body temperatures must be maintained within narrow ranges.
7.39.3.4.31.1	Plot a given Q10 value for a biochemical process.
7.39.3.4.32.1	Explain how isozymes may be involved in seasonal temperature acclimatization.
7.39.3.4.33.1	Explain how fluctuations in body temperature can disrupt complex physiological processes.
7.39.3.4.34.1	Plot a Q10 = 2.5 curve for a physiological process.
7.39.3.4.35.1	What characteristic of isozymes might explain their role in metabolic seasonal temperature acclimatization?
7.39.3.4.36.1	Now that you know how animals are affected by temperature, we next take a look at the adaptations that allow animals to survive wide ranges of thermal environments and wide ranges of metabolic activities.

7.39.3.4.38.1	39.4 Body Temperature Depends on the Balance between Heat In and Heat Out of the Body
7.39.4.1.1	Animals can be classified by their thermoregulatory characteristics
7.39.4.2.1	Endotherms produce substantial amounts of metabolic heat
7.39.4.3.1	Ectotherms and endotherms respond differently to changes in environmental temperature
7.39.4.4.1	Energy budgets reflect adaptations for regulating body temperature
7.39.4.5.1	Both ectotherms and endotherms control blood flow to the skin
7.39.4.6.1	Some fishes conserve metabolic heat
7.39.4.7.1	Some ectotherms regulate metabolic heat production
7.39.4.8.1	Body temperature is a measure of the heat content of the body.
7.39.4.8.2	Animals produce heat internally through their metabolism, and they continuously exchange heat with their environment.
7.39.4.8.3	The balance between heat gain and heat loss determines the animal&#0039;s body temperature.
7.39.4.8.4	Thermoregulatory adaptations enable animals to modulate the various paths of heat exchange between themselves and their environment.
7.39.4.9.1	focus your learning
7.39.4.10.1	Endotherms can increase metabolic heat production to balance increased heat loss to the environment, whereas ectotherms rely largely on behavior to control their heat exchange with the environment.
7.39.4.11.1	The four avenues of heat exchange between an animal and its environment are radiation, convection, conduction, and evaporation.
7.39.4.12.1	A countercurrent heat exchange system in some highly active fishes conserves heat generated by muscle activity.
7.39.4.1.1.1	One way of classifying animals is according to the constancy of their body temperature.
7.39.4.1.1.2	Animals that maintain a constant body temperature are called homeotherms, and animals that experience a fluctuating body temperature are called poikilotherms.
7.39.4.1.1.3	Another classification is based on the source of heat that predominantly determines body temperature.
7.39.4.1.1.4	Endotherms such as birds and mammals have the ability to vary their metabolic heat production to compensate for the loss of heat to the environment.
7.39.4.1.1.5	Ectotherms such as invertebrates, fishes, amphibians, and non-avian reptiles are largely dependent on environmental sources of heat.
7.39.4.1.1.6	We use the terminology of ectotherm and endotherm in this book, but no classification scheme is perfect.
7.39.4.1.1.7	Many ectotherms can generate considerable internal heat to raise their body temperature, and endotherms that hibernate can periodically appear to give up the ability to generate internal heat.
7.39.4.1.1.8	To accommodate these departures from a strict dichotomy, we add the term heterotherms&#8212;organisms that act like ectotherms some of the time and like endotherms at other times.
7.39.4.2.1.1	*Transfers of energy in biological systems are inefficient.
7.39.4.2.1.2	In both ectotherms and endotherms, in every transfer of energy&#8212;from food molecules to ATP, from ATP to biological work&#8212;some of the energy is lost as heat.
7.39.4.2.1.3	Working muscles produce heat, as do all of the metabolic activities of all tissues.
7.39.4.2.2.1	*connect the concepts As discussed in Key Concept 8.1, transfers of energy are governed by the first and second laws of thermodynamics, which explain why heat is always a by-product of metabolism.
7.39.4.2.3.1	Why do endotherms produce more heat than ectotherms?
7.39.4.2.3.2	The surprising answer is that the cells of endotherms are less efficient at using energy than are the cells of ectotherms.
7.39.4.2.3.3	The cells of endotherms are more &#8220;leaky&#8221; to ions than are the cells of ectotherms.
7.39.4.2.3.4	Therefore Na+ ions are constantly diffusing into the cells, and K+ ions are constantly diffusing out.
7.39.4.2.3.5	Even an endotherm at rest must spend considerable amounts of energy to transport Na+ out of the cells and transport K+ back in.
7.39.4.2.3.6	Because of their constant need to actively transport ions, endotherms expend more energy than do ectotherms just to maintain the ion concentration gradients across their cell membranes.
7.39.4.2.3.7	This situation is analogous to a leaky boat: the faster water comes in (i. e. , the faster ions diffuse down their concentration gradients), the more metabolic energy has to be expended to bail the water out (i. e. , pump ions back up their concentration gradients).
7.39.4.2.3.8	Since endotherms expend more energy than ectotherms do to maintain ion concentration gradients, they produce more internal heat.
7.39.4.2.4.1	We can speculate that a mutation resulting in seemingly faulty or leaky ion channels may underlie the evolution of endothermy.
7.39.4.2.4.2	Such a mutation in a small ectotherm would have increased its energy expenditure and therefore its heat production.
7.39.4.2.4.3	Increased heat production would have enabled the animal to be active earlier in the morning or for a longer time after sunset.
7.39.4.2.4.4	Being active in twilight, and eventually at night, would open up a new world of ecological opportunities&#8212;a world in which there was less competition from similar-sized ectotherms and less danger of predation.
7.39.4.2.5.1	Two major differences between endotherms and ectotherms are (1) their resting metabolic rates&#8212;the sum total of all energy expenditures in their bodies when at rest&#8212;and (2) their responses to changes in environmental temperature.
7.39.4.3.1.1	How do similar-sized ectotherms and endotherms respond to changes in environmental temperature?
7.39.4.3.1.2	Let&#0039;s compare a lizard and a mouse.
7.39.4.3.1.3	We put each animal in a closed chamber and measure its body temperature and its resting metabolic rate as we change the temperature of the chamber from 40&#0176;C to 0&#0176;C.
7.39.4.3.1.4	The body temperature of the lizard equilibrates with that of the chamber, whereas the body temperature of the mouse remains stable over most of this range (Figure 39.8A).
7.39.4.3.1.5	The metabolic rate of the lizard (already much lower than that of the mouse when both are at warm temperatures) decreases as the temperature drops (Figure 39.8B).
7.39.4.3.1.6	In contrast, the mouse&#0039;s metabolic rate increases as the chamber temperature falls below 25&#0176;C.
7.39.4.3.1.7	This increase in metabolism produces enough heat to prevent the mouse&#0039;s body temperature from falling.
7.39.4.3.1.8	In other words, the mouse can regulate its body temperature by increasing its metabolic rate and thereby maintain its physiological functions at an optimal level; the lizard cannot.
7.39.4.3.2.1	Figure 39.8 Ectotherms and Endotherms React Differently to Environmental Temperatures
7.39.4.3.3.1	This experiment might lead us to conclude that the ectotherm cannot regulate its body temperature, but observations of the lizard in nature do not support this conclusion.
7.39.4.3.3.2	In nature, the lizard can regulate its body temperature quite well, although it does so by behavioral mechanisms rather than by altering its internal metabolic heat production.
7.39.4.3.3.3	Air temperature in the desert can fluctuate by 40&#0176;C or more in a few hours; the lizard, however, can limit its variation in body temperature and even maintain a fairly stable body temperature by using behavior to alter its heat exchange with the environment.
7.39.4.3.3.4	Its behavioral strategies include spending time in a burrow, basking in the sun, seeking shade, climbing vegetation, and changing its orientation with respect to the sun.
7.39.4.3.4.1	Endotherms also use behavior as a first line of defense against thermal stress.
7.39.4.3.4.2	They select the most comfortable thermal environment possible.
7.39.4.3.4.3	They change posture or their orientation to the sun, move between sun and shade, and move between still air and moving air.
7.39.4.3.4.4	Examples of more complex thermoregulatory behaviors include nest construction and social behaviors such as huddling.
7.39.4.3.4.5	Humans put on or remove clothing and burn fossil fuels to generate the energy to heat or cool buildings.
7.39.4.4.1.1	Figure 39.9 Animals Exchange Heat with the Environment
7.39.4.4.2.1	Both ectotherms and endotherms influence their body temperatures by altering four avenues of heat exchange between their bodies and the environment (Figure 39.9):
7.39.4.4.3.1	Radiation Heat moves from warmer objects to cooler ones via the exchange of infrared radiation (what you feel when you stand in front of a fire).
7.39.4.4.4.1	Convection Heat exchanges with a surrounding medium such as air or water that flows over a surface (the wind-chill factor).
7.39.4.4.5.1	Conduction Heat flows directly between two objects at different temperatures when they come into contact (e. g. , an icepack on a sprained ankle).
7.39.4.4.6.1	Evaporation Heat is transferred away from a surface when water evaporates on that surface (the effect of sweating).
7.39.4.4.7.1	The total balance of heat production and heat exchange can be expressed as an energy budget, based on the simple fact that if the body temperature of an animal is to remain constant, the heat entering the animal must equal the heat leaving it.
7.39.4.4.7.2	The heat coming in is usually from metabolism and radiation (Rabs, for radiation absorbed).
7.39.4.4.7.3	Heat leaves the body via the four mechanisms listed above&#8212;radiation emitted (Rout), convection, conduction, and evaporation.
7.39.4.4.7.4	The energy budget takes the mathematical form
7.39.4.4.8.1	The energy budget is a useful concept because any adaptation that influences the ability of an animal to control its temperature must affect one or more components of the energy budget.
7.39.4.4.8.2	The energy budget gives us the ability to quantify and compare the thermal adaptations of animals.
7.39.4.4.8.3	One interesting observation is that all of the components on the right side of the energy budget equation&#8212;that is, the heat-loss side&#8212;depend on the surface temperature of the animal.
7.39.4.4.8.4	In fact, if the environmental temperature is above skin surface temperature, convection and conduction are avenues of heat gain rather than loss.
7.39.4.4.8.5	One way surface temperature can be controlled is by altering the flow of blood to the skin.
7.39.4.5.1.1	Heat is mostly moved around the internal environment by blood flow.
7.39.4.5.1.2	Heat produced in muscles during exercise is transported out of the muscle and to the heart in the blood.
7.39.4.5.1.3	That heat is then distributed around the body by the blood, raising body temperature.
7.39.4.5.1.4	Blood flow to the skin enables internal heat to be lost to the environment through radiation, convection, conduction, and evaporation, thus bringing the body temperature back toward normal.
7.39.4.5.1.5	When body temperature is too low or the environment is too cold, the blood vessels supplying the skin constrict, reducing heat loss to the environment.
7.39.4.5.2.1	The ability to control blood flow to the skin can be an important adaptation for an ectotherm such as the marine iguana (a reptile) of the Gal&#0225;pagos archipelago (Figure 39.10).
7.39.4.5.2.2	The Gal&#0225;pagos are volcanic islands that lie on the equator but are bathed by cold ocean currents.
7.39.4.5.2.3	Iguanas bask on hot black lava rocks on the shore, and periodically enter the cold ocean water to feed on seaweed.
7.39.4.5.2.4	While the iguanas are feeding, they lose heat to the cold ocean water.
7.39.4.5.2.5	This cooling lowers their metabolism, making them slower, more vulnerable to predators, and incapable of efficient digestion.
7.39.4.5.2.6	The iguanas therefore alternate between feeding in the cold seawater and basking on the hot rocks.
7.39.4.5.2.7	It is advantageous for iguanas to retain body heat as long as possible while swimming and to warm up as fast as possible when basking.
7.39.4.5.2.8	They accomplish these results by changing their heart rate and thus the rate of blood flow to their skin and around their bodies.
7.39.4.5.2.9	Figure 39.10 Some Ectotherms Regulate Blood Flow to the Skin
7.39.4.5.3.1	What about furred mammals?
7.39.4.5.3.2	Fur acts as insulation to keep body heat in, making it possible for mammals to function in cold environments.
7.39.4.5.3.3	When they are active, however, mammals must get rid of excess heat, and it does little good to transport that heat to the skin under the fur.
7.39.4.5.3.4	Thus, as mentioned at the opening of this chapter, mammals have specialized blood vessels for transporting heat to their hairless skin surfaces.
7.39.4.5.3.5	Heat loss from these areas is tightly controlled by the opening and closing of these blood vessels.
7.39.4.5.3.6	When you are cold, the blood flow to your hands and feet decreases and they feel cold, but when you exercise, the blood vessels serving these skin areas dilate increasing the blood flow and therefore the heat dissipation.
7.39.4.6.1.1	The muscles of active fishes produce substantial amounts of metabolic heat, but most fishes cannot retain that heat.
7.39.4.6.1.2	Blood pumped from the fish heart goes directly to the gills, where it comes very close to the surrounding water to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide.
7.39.4.6.1.3	Any heat the blood picks up from metabolically active muscles is lost to the water flowing across its gills.
7.39.4.6.1.4	It is therefore surprising that some large, rapidly swimming fishes, such as giant bluefin tuna (see Figure 1.15A) and great white sharks, can maintain swimming muscle temperatures 10&#0176;C&#8211;15&#0176;C higher than the surrounding water.
7.39.4.6.1.5	The heat comes from their powerful swimming muscles, and the ability of these &#8220;hot&#8221; fishes to conserve that heat is based on the remarkable arrangement of their blood vessels.
7.39.4.6.2.1	In the typical (&#8220;cold&#8221;) fish circulatory system, oxygenated blood from the gills collects in a large blood vessel, the aorta, that runs through the center of the fish, distributing blood to all organs and muscles (Figure 39.11A). &#8220;Hot&#8221; fishes have a small aorta, and most of their oxygenated blood is transported in large side vessels just under the skin (Figure 39.11B).
7.39.4.6.2.2	The cold blood leaving the gills is therefore kept close to the surface of the &#8220;hot&#8221; fishes as it flows posteriorly to the swimming muscles.
7.39.4.6.2.3	The cold blood flows into the muscle mass through small vessels branching off the large side vessels.
7.39.4.6.2.4	These many small vessels run parallel to the vessels carrying warm blood from the swimming muscles back toward the heart.
7.39.4.6.2.5	Because the vessels carrying the cold blood into the muscles are in close contact with the vessels carrying warm blood out of the muscles, heat flows from the warm to the cold blood by conduction.
7.39.4.6.2.6	Therefore the heat produced by the active muscles is retained in the muscle mass.
7.39.4.6.3.1	Because heat is exchanged between blood vessels carrying blood in opposite directions, this adaptation is called countercurrent heat exchange (Figure 39.11C).
7.39.4.6.3.2	By keeping heat within the muscles, these fishes can maintain an internal body temperature considerably higher than the water temperature.
7.39.4.6.3.3	Each 10&#0176;C rise in muscle temperature increases the fish&#0039;s power output almost threefold, giving it a faster and more powerful swimming capability.
7.39.4.6.4.1	Figure 39.11  &#8220;Cold&#8221; and &#8220;Hot&#8221; Fishes
7.39.4.7.1.1	By definition, ectotherms are largely dependent on environmental sources of heat for thermoregulation, but some ectotherms raise their body temperatures by producing metabolic heat.
7.39.4.7.1.2	For example, the powerful flight muscles of many insects must reach 35&#0176;C&#8211;40&#0176;C before the insects can fly, and they must maintain these high temperatures during flight.
7.39.4.7.1.3	Such insects warm up to fly by contracting their flight muscles isometrically in a manner similar to shivering in mammals.
7.39.4.7.1.4	The heat-producing ability of insect muscle can be quite remarkable.
7.39.4.7.1.5	An impressive case is a species of scarab beetle that lives mostly underground in mountains north of Los Angeles, California.
7.39.4.7.1.6	These beetles come aboveground to mate, with the males flying in search of females.
7.39.4.7.1.7	They undertake this mating ritual only at night, in winter, during snowstorms.
7.39.4.7.2.1	Honey bees regulate temperature as a group.
7.39.4.7.2.2	They live in large colonies consisting mostly of female worker bees that maintain the hive and rear the larval offspring of the single queen bee.
7.39.4.7.2.3	During winter, worker bees cluster around the brood (eggs and larvae).
7.39.4.7.2.4	They adjust their individual metabolic heat production and density of clustering so that the brood temperature remains remarkably constant, at about 34&#0176;C, even as the outside air temperature drops below freezing.
7.39.4.7.3.1	39.4 recap
7.39.4.7.4.1	Endotherms use metabolic heat production to maintain constant high body temperatures.
7.39.4.7.4.2	Body temperatures of ectotherms are more dependent on environmental heat sources.
7.39.4.7.4.3	Both ectotherms and endotherms use behavior to control their body temperature.
7.39.4.7.4.4	Heat exchange between an animal and its environment occurs via radiation, convection, conduction, and evaporation, all of which depend on body surface temperature.
7.39.4.7.4.5	Some ectotherms use metabolic heat production episodically to raise body temperature.

7.39.4.7.10.1	Why is the body temperature of an ectotherm that is exposed to variations in environmental temperature more constant in nature than in the laboratory?

7.39.4.7.13.1	Endotherms respond to changes in environmental temperature by changing their rates of metabolic heat production.
7.39.4.7.13.2	They also have other adaptations for controlling their rates of heat exchange with their environments.
7.39.4.7.13.3	How do they regulate these various avenues of heat exchange to achieve a constant internal body temperature?
7.39.4.7.14.1	Chapter 39 continues with
7.39.4.7.15.1	39.5 Body Temperature Is Regulated through Adaptations for Heat Production and Heat Loss
7.39.5.1.1	Basal heat production rates of endotherms correlate with body size
7.39.5.2.1	Endotherms respond to cold by producing heat and adapt to cold by reducing heat loss
7.39.5.3.1	Evaporation of water can dissipate heat, but at a cost
7.39.5.4.1	The mammalian thermostat uses feedback information
7.39.5.5.1	Some animals conserve energy by turning down the thermostat
7.39.5.6.1	As explained in Key Concept 39.2, there is a difference between control and regulation.
7.39.5.6.2	Think of driving your car.
7.39.5.6.3	You control the speed of the car with the accelerator and the brake, but you regulate the speed of your car by comparing the speed limit (set point) with your speedometer (feedback) to generate command signals to your foot that is operating the accelerator and brake.
7.39.5.6.4	For understanding how body temperature is regulated, you must understand the adaptations for heat production and heat loss, how they are controlled, and what information is used to modulate the control signals to achieve a regulated body temperature.
7.39.5.7.1	focus your learning
7.39.5.8.1	The basal metabolic rate (BMR) of an endotherm is the lowest metabolic rate necessary for biochemical and physiological processes of a resting animal.
7.39.5.9.1	Endotherms produce and conserve metabolic heat to offset heat loss in cold environments.
7.39.5.10.1	Mammalian body temperature is controlled by a regulatory center in the hypothalamus that uses hypothalamic temperature as the feedback information.
7.39.5.1.1.1	Physiologists can determine an animal&#0039;s metabolic rate and therefore its rate of heat production by measuring its consumption of O2 or production of CO2.
7.39.5.1.1.2	Within a narrow range of environmental temperatures, called the thermoneutral zone (see Figure 39.9B), the metabolic rates of endotherms (birds and mammals) are at low levels and independent of environmental temperature.
7.39.5.1.1.3	The metabolic rate of a resting endotherm at a temperature within its thermoneutral zone is its basal metabolic rate (BMR).
7.39.5.1.1.4	BMR is usually measured in animals that are quiet but awake and not using energy for digestion, reproduction, or growth.
7.39.5.1.1.5	Thus BMR is the rate at which a resting animal is consuming just enough energy to carry out its minimal body functions.
7.39.5.1.2.1	As you might expect, the BMR of an elephant is greater than that of a mouse.
7.39.5.1.2.2	After all, the elephant is more than 100,000 times larger than the mouse.
7.39.5.1.2.3	However, the BMR of the elephant is only about 7,000 times greater than that of the mouse.
7.39.5.1.2.4	That means that a gram of mouse tissue uses energy at a rate 15 times greater than a gram of elephant tissue (Figure 39.12).
7.39.5.1.2.5	Across all of the endotherms, BMR per gram of tissue increases as animals get smaller.
7.39.5.1.3.1	Figure 39.12 The Mouse-to-Elephant Curve
7.39.5.1.4.1	Why should this disproportionate difference exist?
7.39.5.1.4.2	There are several possible reasons.
7.39.5.1.4.3	As animals get bigger, they have a smaller surface area-to-volume ratio (see Figure 5.2).
7.39.5.1.4.4	Since heat production is related to the volume (i. e. , mass) of the animal, but its capacity to dissipate heat is related to its surface area, it has been reasoned that larger animals evolved lower metabolic rates to avoid overheating.
7.39.5.1.4.5	However, this explanation alone is insufficient because the relationship between body mass and basal metabolic rate holds for even very small organisms and for ectotherms, in which overheating is not a problem.
7.39.5.1.4.6	Other hypotheses have also been proposed.
7.39.5.1.4.7	For example, a larger animal has a greater proportion of support tissues (e. g. , skin and bone), which are not as metabolically active as other tissue types.
7.39.5.1.4.8	The real explanation is probably a mixture of different factors, but the relationship holds over a very broad range of species.
7.39.5.1.4.9	Figure 39.13 Environmental Temperature and Mammalian Metabolic Rates
7.39.5.1.5.1	For an endotherm, a metabolic rate versus environmental temperature curve represents the integrated response of all the animal&#0039;s thermoregulatory adaptations (Figure 39.13).
7.39.5.1.5.2	The thermoneutral zone is bounded by a lower critical temperature and an upper critical temperature.
7.39.5.1.5.3	When the environmental temperature is within the thermoneutral zone, an endotherm&#0039;s thermoregulatory responses do not require much energy and could be considered passive; such responses include changing posture, fluffing fur or feathers, and altering blood flow to the skin.
7.39.5.1.5.4	Outside its thermoneutral zone, however, an endotherm&#0039;s thermoregulatory responses are active and require metabolic energy.
7.39.5.2.1.1	When environmental temperatures fall below the lower critical temperature, endotherms increase metabolic heat production to compensate for heat loss.
7.39.5.2.1.2	Mammals can accomplish this by shivering and/or nonshivering heat production.
7.39.5.2.1.3	Birds use only shivering heat production.
7.39.5.2.1.4	Shivering uses the contractions of skeletal muscles to convert ATP to ADP, with the energy from this process released as heat.
7.39.5.2.1.5	Shivering muscles pull against each other so that little movement other than a tremor results. &#8220;Shivering heat production&#8221; is perhaps too narrow a term, however; increased muscle tone and increased body movements also contribute to increased heat production in cold environments.
7.39.5.2.2.1	Most nonshivering heat production occurs in specialized adipose tissue called brown fat.
7.39.5.2.2.2	This tissue looks brown because of its abundant mitochondria and rich blood supply.
7.39.5.2.2.3	In brown fat cells, a protein called thermogenin uncouples proton movement from ATP production, allowing protons to leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane rather than having to pass through the ATP synthase and generate ATP (review the discussion of brown fat and the chemiosmotic mechanism in Key Concept 9.3).
7.39.5.2.2.4	As a result, metabolic fuels are consumed without producing ATP, but heat is still released.
7.39.5.2.3.1	Pads of brown fat are found in newborns of many mammalian species.
7.39.5.2.3.2	Brown fat is also commonly found in adult mammals that are small and acclimatized to cold, and in mammals that hi-bernate.
7.39.5.2.3.3	Recently it has been discovered that adult humans have small amounts of brown fat distributed around the body and that its metabolic activity is stimulated by cold exposure.
7.39.5.2.3.4	One study found less brown fat activity in obese than in lean individuals, leading to the hypothesis that individual differences in propensity for weight gain may be related to the amount of brown fat in an individual, as described in the opening stories of Chapters 9 and 40.
7.39.5.2.4.1	In addition to their ability to produce heat, endotherms that live in cold climates have evolved adaptations to reduce their heat loss.
7.39.5.2.4.2	Heat is lost from the body surface, and cold-climate species have anatomical adaptations that give them smaller surface area-to-volume ratios than their warm-climate relatives (Figure 39.14).
7.39.5.2.4.3	These adaptations include rounder body shapes and shorter appendages.
7.39.5.2.4.4	Figure 39.14 Adaptations to Cold and Hot Climates
7.39.5.2.5.1	The most common and important means of decreasing heat loss is to increase thermal insulation.
7.39.5.2.5.2	Animals adapted to cold climates have much thicker layers of fur, feathers, and/or fat than do their warm-climate relatives.
7.39.5.2.5.3	Fur and feathers are good insulators because they trap a layer of still, warm air close to the skin surface.
7.39.5.2.5.4	If that air is displaced by water, insulation is drastically reduced.
7.39.5.2.5.5	In many species, oil secretions spread through fur or feathers by grooming are critical for resisting wetting and maintaining a high level of insulation.
7.39.5.2.5.6	In terms of the energy budget equation presented in Key Concept 39.4, remember that heat exchange between the animal and its environment is a function of the animal&#0039;s surface temperature.
7.39.5.2.5.7	For a body area covered by fur or feathers, surface temperature is that of the outer surface of the fur or feathers.
7.39.5.2.6.1	The ability to decrease blood flow to the noninsulated skin is an important thermoregulatory adaptation for cold-climate endotherms.
7.39.5.2.6.2	Constriction of blood vessels in the skin, and especially in the appendages, greatly improves an animal&#0039;s ability to conserve heat.
7.39.5.2.6.3	Countercurrent heat exchange like that you saw in &#8220;hot&#8221; fishes is also an important adaptation in the appendages of endotherms.
7.39.5.2.6.4	Warm blood flowing out to the paw of a wolf, the hoof of a caribou, or the foot of a bird parallels the flow of the cooler blood returning to the body core.
7.39.5.2.6.5	Heat is transferred from the outgoing to the returning blood, thus retaining heat in the animal&#0039;s core.
7.39.5.3.1.1	At the upper end of the thermoneutral zone, an endotherm dissipates heat through adaptations that don&#0039;t require much energy: increasing blood flow to the skin, seeking shade and cool breezes, and decreasing activity.
7.39.5.3.1.2	But when the environmental temperature exceeds the upper critical temperature, these adaptations are not sufficient and overheating becomes a problem.
7.39.5.3.1.3	For exercising animals (including athletes), overheating can occur even at low environmental temperatures.
7.39.5.3.1.4	Large mammals, especially those in hot habitats such as elephants, rhinoceroses, and water buffaloes, have little or no insulating fur and seek out water to wallow in when the air temperature is high.
7.39.5.3.1.5	Having water in contact with the skin greatly increases heat loss because the heat-absorbing capacity of water is much greater than that of air.
7.39.5.3.2.1	Evaporation from external or internal body surfaces through sweating or panting can also cool an endotherm.
7.39.5.3.2.2	A gram of water absorbs about 580 calories of heat when it evaporates.
7.39.5.3.2.3	If this evaporation occurs on the skin, most of the heat comes from the skin.
7.39.5.3.2.4	However, sweat or saliva that falls off the body provides no cooling.
7.39.5.3.2.5	Thus when the need for heat loss is greatest, water from the internal environment can be squandered with no cooling benefit.
7.39.5.3.2.6	Water is heavy, so animals do not carry an excess supply of it, and many hot environments are also arid.
7.39.5.3.2.7	In habitats that are both hot and dry, sweating and panting are cooling adaptations of last resort.
7.39.5.3.3.1	Sweating and panting are active processes that require expending metabolic energy.
7.39.5.3.3.2	That is why the metabolic rate increases when the upper critical temperature is exceeded (see Figure 39.16).
7.39.5.3.3.3	A sweating or panting animal is generating heat in the process of dissipating heat, which can be a losing battle.
7.39.5.4.1.1	The thermoregulatory mechanisms and adaptations of endotherms are controlled by neural regulatory systems that integrate information from environmental and internal sources and then issue commands to the effectors that alter the heat content of the body.
7.39.5.4.1.2	These regulatory systems are similar in principle in birds and mammals but differ in many details.
7.39.5.4.1.3	Here we focus on the nervous system thermostats of mammals.
7.39.5.4.1.4	Figure 39.15 The Mammalian Thermostat
7.39.5.4.2.1	The major thermoregulatory integrative center of mammals is at the base of the brain in a structure called the hypothalamus (Figure 39.15).
7.39.5.4.2.2	The hypothalamus is a key player in many regulatory systems of vertebrates.
7.39.5.4.2.3	Experiments demonstrating its role have shown that slight cooling of the hypothalamus stimulates constriction of skin blood vessels and that stronger cooling increases metabolic heat production.
7.39.5.4.2.4	As a result, cooling of the hypothalamus in an unchanging, thermoneutral environment will cause body temperature to rise.
7.39.5.4.2.5	Conversely, hypothalamic heating causes the overall body temperature to fall (Figure 39.16).

7.39.5.4.6.2	The body&#0039;s responses to the manipulations were as expected if the hypothalamus is the mammalian &#8220;thermostat. &#8221;
7.39.5.4.7.1	HYPOTHESIS Heating or cooling the mammalian hypothalamus results in predictable changes in body temperature.
7.39.5.4.8.1	METHOD
7.39.5.4.9.1	Implant a probe into the hypothalamus of a living ground squirrel&#0039;s brain.
7.39.5.4.9.2	Use the probe to heat or cool the hypothalamus directly (i. e. , without affecting the ambient temperature).
7.39.5.4.10.1	Manipulate the hypothalamic temperature TH.
7.39.5.4.11.1	Measure the animal&#0039;s metabolic rate and body temperature throughout the period of hypothalamic manipulation.
7.39.5.4.12.1	RESULTS
7.39.5.4.13.1	CONCLUSION  The ground squirrel&#0039;s hypothalamus acts as a thermostat.
7.39.5.4.13.2	When cooled, it activates metabolic heat production; when warmed, it suppresses metabolic heat production and favors heat loss.
7.39.5.4.14.1	In mammals, the temperature of the hypothalamus itself is the major feedback signal.
7.39.5.4.14.2	The hypothalamus generates set points for various thermoregulatory responses.
7.39.5.4.14.3	When the temperature of the hypothalamus exceeds or drops below those set points, thermoregulatory responses are controlled to reverse the direction of temperature change (see Figure 39.15).
7.39.5.4.14.4	The system integrates other sources of information in addition to hypothalamic temperature.
7.39.5.4.14.5	For example, temperature sensors in the skin register environmental temperature.
7.39.5.4.14.6	A change in skin temperature is feedforward information that shifts hypothalamic set points; the set point for metabolic heat production is higher when the skin is cold and lower when the skin is warm.
7.39.5.4.15.1	Hypothalamic set points are higher during wakefulness than during sleep, and they are higher during the active part of the daily cycle than the inactive part, even if the animal is awake at both times.
7.39.5.4.15.2	Even when an endotherm is kept under constant environmental conditions, its body temperature displays a daily cycle of changes in set point.
7.39.5.4.15.3	This kind of cycle, a *circadian rhythm, is controlled by an internal biological clock.
7.39.5.4.16.1	*connect the concepts Key Concept 52.5 explains how a region of the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus generates endogenous daily cycles called circadian rhythms that influence many physiological processes, including temperature regulation.
7.39.5.5.1.1	Hypothermia is a below-normal body temperature.
7.39.5.5.1.2	It can result from starvation (lack of metabolic fuel), exposure to extreme cold, serious illness, or anesthesia.
7.39.5.5.1.3	In each of these cases, the drop in body temperature is unregulated.
7.39.5.5.1.4	However, many birds and mammals undergo regulated hypothermia to survive periods of cold and food scarcity.
7.39.5.5.2.1	Hummingbirds, for example, are very small endotherms with a high metabolic rate, and going even a single day without food could exhaust their metabolic reserves.
7.39.5.5.2.2	Hummingbirds and other small endotherms extend the period over which they can survive without food by dropping their body temperature by 10&#0176;C&#8211;20&#0176;C during the portion of day when they are normally inactive, thus lowering their metabolic rate and conserving energy.
7.39.5.5.2.3	Daily bouts of regulated hypothermia are called daily torpor.
7.39.5.5.2.4	Figure 39.17 Hibernation Patterns in a Ground Squirrel
7.39.5.5.3.1	Regulated hypothermia that lasts for days or even weeks, during which the body temperature falls close to environmental temperature, is called hibernation (Figure 39.17).
7.39.5.5.3.2	Many species of mammals, including bats, bears, marmots, and ground squirrels, hibernate, but only one species of bird (the common poorwill) has been shown to hibernate.
7.39.5.5.3.3	The metabolic rate needed to sustain a hibernating animal may be only one-fiftieth its basal metabolic rate, and many hibernating animals maintain body temperatures close to the freezing point.
7.39.5.5.3.4	Arousal from hibernation occurs when the hypothalamic set point returns to the normal level.
7.39.5.5.3.5	The ability of animals to enter daily torpor or deep hibernation to reduce their thermoregulatory set point so dramatically probably evolved as an extension of the set point decrease that accompanies sleep in all mammals and birds.
7.39.5.5.4.1	39.5 recap
7.39.5.5.5.1	Within the thermoneutral zone, an endotherm controls its body temperature by passive means.
7.39.5.5.5.2	Above or below the thermoneutral zone, an endotherm must expend considerable metabolic energy to control body temperature.
7.39.5.5.5.3	Thermoregulatory responses in mammals are regulated by the hypothalamus.
7.39.5.5.6.1	learning outcomes
7.39.5.5.7.1	You should be able to:
7.39.5.5.8.1	Describe the thermoneutral zone and the upper and lower critical temperatures and how they relate to the basal metabolic rate of an endotherm.
7.39.5.5.9.1	Interpret a plot of metabolic rate versus environmental temperature for an endotherm.
7.39.5.5.10.1	Explain differences in physical features of endotherms of the same or similar species that live in climates of different temperature extremes.
7.39.5.5.11.1	Describe how the mammalian brain thermostat uses feedback and feedforward information to regulate body temperature.
7.39.5.5.12.1	Explain the variable features of the mammalian thermoregulatory system.
7.39.5.5.13.1	What determines the upper and lower boundaries of the thermoneutral zone?
7.39.5.5.14.1	In the metabolic rate versus ambient temperature curve for mammals shown in Figure 39.13, the segment of the curve below the lower critical temperature is described by the equation MR = K(Tb &#8722; Ta).
7.39.5.5.14.2	In this equation, what does K stand for?
7.39.5.5.14.3	Why does this equation predict that the curve it describes will meet the x axis at a temperature that equals body temperature?
7.39.5.5.15.1	Explain why arctic species of mammals tend to be bigger and stockier than closely related species in warmer environments.

7.39.5.5.18.1	investigating life
7.39.5.5.19.1	How can we increase heat loss from the body to protect against heat stress?
7.39.5.5.20.1	In the opening story to this chapter you saw that body temperature is a critical factor in limiting physical performance.
7.39.5.5.20.2	In Key Concept 39.4 you learned that body surface temperature is a critical factor in each path of heat loss.
7.39.5.5.20.3	The relevant body surface temperature for furred mammals is mostly the surface of the fur.
7.39.5.5.20.4	For us it is mostly the surface of our clothing.
7.39.5.5.20.5	We can take off our clothes, but furred mammals cannot take off their fur.
7.39.5.5.20.6	Mammals have evolved special blood vessel adaptations in their non-hairy skin that can accommodate large volumes of blood and therefore support high levels of heat loss.
7.39.5.5.20.7	The experiment in Investigating Life: Can the Work Capacity of Muscle Be Increased by Extracting Heat from the Palms of the Hands? used a technology to extract large amounts of heat from the palm of one hand and showed a resulting improvement in ability to do muscular work.
7.39.5.5.21.1	How does this heat-loss adaptation, and the technology designed to amplify it, work?
7.39.5.5.22.1	Blood flows from the heart through large arteries, then through small arteries, and then through the tiny capillaries that nourish the tissues and carry away waste products of metabolism, and then into veins that carry the blood back to the heart.
7.39.5.5.22.2	The circulatory adaptations of the &#8220;heat portals&#8221; in non-hairy mammalian skin are an exception to this pattern.
7.39.5.5.22.3	In the non-hairy skin, gated shunts deliver arterial blood directly to veins, bypassing the capillaries.
7.39.5.5.22.4	These veins in non-hairy skin form networks that can accommodate a large volume of blood when the shunts are open.
7.39.5.5.22.5	Based on this knowledge, biologists at Stanford University developed the &#8220;rapid-cooling&#8221; technology used in the experiment in Investigating Life: Can the Work Capacity of Muscle Be Increased by Extracting Heat from the Palms of the Hands?
7.39.5.5.22.6	The palm of the hand (non-hairy skin) is placed in contact with a cooled surface and a mild vacuum is used to pull more blood into the large, heat-exchanging blood vessels.
7.39.5.5.22.7	When this device is used, body temperature rises more slowly during exercise and cools more rapidly during rest after exercise.
7.39.5.5.23.1	As expected, this rapid cooling technology greatly increased endurance for exercise in the heat, but an unexpected discovery was enhanced athletic performance.
7.39.5.5.23.2	Because muscle fatigue is partly due to increased muscle temperature, enhanced cooling reduces fatigue and increases exercise capacity, which in turn can lead to conditioning gains.
7.39.5.5.23.3	In one study, first-year college students in a conditioning program doubled their rate of physical conditioning when they used the cooling technology.
7.39.5.5.23.4	After 6 weeks of training, some men and women in the study achieved more than 900 pushups or hundreds of pull-ups in a 45-minute workout session.
7.39.5.5.24.1	Future directions
7.39.5.5.25.1	In this chapter you learned that virtually all biological processes are affected by temperature.
7.39.5.5.25.2	Therefore, if we have a new technology that can rapidly and efficiently alter the heat content of the body, we should find many applications for it.
7.39.5.5.25.3	What could some of those applications be besides improving athletic performance?
7.39.5.5.25.4	Consider a few medical applications.
7.39.5.5.25.5	Active thermoregulatory responses such as vasoconstriction, shivering, and sweating depend on control by the nervous system, but all of these mechanisms are inactivated by anesthesia and patients can become seriously hypothermic.
7.39.5.5.25.6	Their body temperatures could be stabilized by heat exchange through their natural heat portals.
7.39.5.5.25.7	Some medical conditions render patients terribly temperature-sensitive.
7.39.5.5.25.8	An example is multiple sclerosis.
7.39.5.5.25.9	Individuals with MS can suffer serious increases in their symptoms if their body temperature rises even a little bit.
7.39.5.5.25.10	They may lose vision, balance, the ability to walk, or the ability to think clearly.
7.39.5.5.25.11	Could they be protected from the effects of heat by cooling their natural heat portals?
7.39.5.5.25.12	Evidence suggests that some cancer treatments could be augmented by the induction of hyperthermia and that the consequences of stroke or heart attack could be lessened by timely induction of hypothermia.

7.39.summary.31.2	These intermittent arousals from torpor include three phases: warming, maintenance of normal body temperature, and recooling.

7.40.8.1	The Exercise Hormone
7.40.9.1	Some active people eat a lot and never put on weight.
7.40.9.2	Do they stay thin simply because exercising burns excess calories that would be stored as fat?
7.40.9.3	There are two kinds of fat. &#8220;White&#8221; fat stores lipids, and &#8220;brown&#8221; fat metabolizes lipids to produce heat without producing ATP.
7.40.9.4	Brown fat is present in cold-acclimated rodents, hibernators, and newborn humans, but it was not thought to be present in adult humans.
7.40.9.5	Recently, imaging techniques revealed brown fat activity in cold-exposed adults.
7.40.9.6	What is interesting is that the amount of brown fat is inversely proportional to total body mass&#8211;lean people have more brown fat and obese people have less.
7.40.9.7	Perhaps the excess calories burned by brown fat contribute to low body mass.
7.40.10.1	A recently discovered signaling molecule may explain the difference in individual propensities to put on weight.
7.40.10.2	Because this molecule, which was named irisin, circulates in the blood, it was designated a hormone.
7.40.10.3	Irisin was discovered in a strain of mice bred for increased exercise endurance capacity, and it was shown that the irisin molecule is produced in and released from active muscles.
7.40.11.1	Training causes numerous structural and metabolic changes in muscle.
7.40.11.2	Training also improves many other aspects of health.
7.40.11.3	How are these changes mediated?
7.40.11.4	Analysis of fat tissue from the super athletic mice showed a remarkable finding: their white fat had properties of brown fat.
7.40.11.5	Moreover, this &#8220;browning&#8221; of white fat was triggered by irisin.
7.40.11.6	That is, active muscles in mice signal white fat to change its properties to become metabolically active, burn more calories, and produce more heat.
7.40.11.7	So in addition to improving the condition of muscles, exercise also causes muscles to &#8220;talk&#8221; to white fat, telling it to &#8220;shape up. &#8221;
7.40.12.1	Lots of questions followed the discovery of irisin in mice.
7.40.12.2	Is it produced in humans during exercise?
7.40.12.3	Does it have effects on tissues other than fat?
7.40.12.4	Might other benefits of exercise be attributed to it?
7.40.12.5	More research is under way.
7.40.13.1	This chapter covers the remarkable roles that hormones play in regulating physiological systems.
7.40.13.2	A hormone is a chemical message that circulates in the blood and activates distant target cells.
7.40.13.3	The power of hormones to initiate physiological change is reflected in the name irisin.
7.40.13.4	Iris was the messenger of the Greek gods, traveling the world with the speed of the wind.

7.40.1.2.1	Endocrine signaling can act locally or at a distance
7.40.1.3.1	Hormones are divided into three chemical groups
7.40.1.4.1	Hormone action is mediated by receptors on or within their target cells
7.40.1.5.1	Hormone action depends on the nature of the target cell and its receptors
7.40.1.6.1	Hormone structure is conserved through evolution, but functions change
7.40.1.7.1	In multicellular animals, physiological regulatory systems require information and cell-to-cell communication.
7.40.1.7.2	Most intercellular communication is by means of chemical signals that bind to receptors, as described in Chapter 7.
7.40.1.7.3	Some types of chemical signals discussed in other chapters include growth factors, morphogens, and cytokines.
7.40.1.7.4	In future chapters you will learn about chemical signals used by the nervous system called neurotransmitters.
7.40.1.7.5	Each of these examples involves a chemical message secreted by cells and received by other cells (target cells) that have appropriate receptors.
7.40.1.7.6	These four classes of chemical signals are named according to the types of actions they have: growth factors influence cell division, morphogens influence developmental processes, cytokines control immune system cells, and neurotransmitters enable nerve cells to communicate with each other and with target cells such as muscles.
7.40.1.7.7	In this chapter we cover another broad class of chemical signals called endocrines, which are secreted by epithelial cells directly into the extracellular fluid (ECF; see Key Concept 39.2).
7.40.1.7.8	From the ECF, endocrines can diffuse locally and also into the blood, where they circulate throughout the body.
7.40.1.8.1	focus your learning
7.40.1.9.1	Hormones affect target cells that have appropriate receptors.
7.40.1.10.1	Hormones stimulate signal transduction pathways in target cells either by binding to specific receptors on cell surfaces or by diffusing through the cell membrane to bind to internal receptors.
7.40.1.11.1	Different target cells can respond to the same hormone in different ways depending on the signal transduction pathway stimulated.
7.40.1.12.1	Intercellular chemical signaling mechanisms evolved early in the evolutionary history of multicellular animals.
7.40.1.1.1.1	Some analogies might help differentiate how chemical signaling in the immune, nervous, and endocrine informational systems works.
7.40.1.1.1.2	The immune system (the topic of Chapter 42) operates like an army of private security guards.
7.40.1.1.1.3	Immune system cells make their rounds of the body, and if they detect a security breach, they sound their alarms&#8212;cytokines&#8212;that activate the body&#8217;s defenses.
7.40.1.1.1.4	The nervous system (see Chapters 44&#8211;46) operates like a landline telephone system, with a central integration and command center that sends signals along specific wires to specific receivers.
7.40.1.1.1.5	The endocrine system is more like a radio, television, or cell-phone system, broadcasting signals that can be picked up by anyone who has an appropriate receiver that is turned on and tuned in.
7.40.1.1.1.6	Some endocrine signals are weak like those of a walkie-talkie and are picked up only locally, but others are strong like those of a major broadcast station and reach distant parts of the body.
7.40.1.1.1.7	In all cases, the signals are received only by cells that have appropriate receptors, and the responses are determined by the receiving cell&#8217;s internal signal transduction machinery.
7.40.1.2.1.1	Endocrine signals that enter the blood are called hormones (from a Greek word meaning to excite, arouse, or stimulate).
7.40.1.2.1.2	Hormones activate target cells wherever they occur in the body (Figure 40.1A).
7.40.1.2.1.3	You probably are familiar with several hormones, such as testosterone, estrogen, adrenaline (also called epinephrine), and insulin.
7.40.1.2.1.4	Those molecules are well known, as are their sites of release and their actions.
7.40.1.2.1.5	Figure 40.1 Chemical Signaling Systems
7.40.1.2.2.1	Some endocrine signals are released in such tiny quantities, or are so rapidly inactivated by enzymes or taken up so efficiently by local cells, that they never diffuse into the blood in sufficient amounts to act on distant cells (Figure 40.1B).
7.40.1.2.2.2	Because these signals affect only target cells near their release site, they are called paracrines (para, &#8220;near&#8221;).
7.40.1.2.2.3	An example of a paracrine signal is histamine, one of the mediators of inflammation.
7.40.1.2.2.4	The most local action an endocrine signal can have is when it binds to receptors on or in the same cell that secreted it.
7.40.1.2.2.5	An autocrine signal is so named because it influences the cell that secreted it.
7.40.1.2.2.6	Hormones and paracrines can have autocrine functions as a means of providing negative feedback to control their own rates of secretion.
7.40.1.2.3.1	Some endocrine cells exist as single cells within a tissue.
7.40.1.2.3.2	Hormones of the digestive tract, for example, are secreted by isolated endocrine cells in the walls of the stomach and small intestine.
7.40.1.2.3.3	Many hormones are secreted by aggregations of endocrine cells in secretory organs called endocrine glands.
7.40.1.2.3.4	A single endocrine gland may secrete multiple hormones.
7.40.1.2.3.5	Be sure you don&#8217;t confuse endocrine glands with exocrine glands.
7.40.1.2.3.6	Endocrine glands secrete hormones within the body, whereas exocrine glands secrete substances through ducts to the outside of the body (sweat glands and salivary glands are examples).
7.40.1.2.4.1	Two other categories of chemical signals are neuroendocrines or neurohormones that are secreted by nerve cells and enter the circulation, and the pheromones that are released from the body of an animal to influence the behavior and physiology of other animals in its vicinity.
7.40.1.2.4.2	We will discuss pheromones in Chapter 52.
7.40.1.3.1.1	There is enormous diversity in the chemical structure of hormones, but by and large they can be classified into three groups:
7.40.1.3.2.1	Peptide and protein hormones make up the majority of hormones.
7.40.1.3.2.2	A peptide consists of 2 or more amino acids, and a protein is defined as having 50 or more amino acids.
7.40.1.3.2.3	Insulin is therefore a small protein hormone (Figure 40.2A).
7.40.1.3.2.4	Peptide and protein hormones are water-soluble and thus easily transported in the blood.
7.40.1.3.2.5	They can be packaged in vesicles within the cells that make them, and then released by exocytosis.
7.40.1.3.3.1	Steroid hormones (such as estrogen and testosterone) are synthesized from cholesterol (Figure 40.2B), are lipid-soluble, and pass easily through cell membranes.
7.40.1.3.3.2	Steroid hormones diffuse out of the cells that make them and are usually bound to carrier molecules in the blood.
7.40.1.3.4.1	Amine hormones are mostly synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine (thyroxine is one example; Figure 40.2C).
7.40.1.3.4.2	Some amine hormones are water-soluble and others are lipid-soluble; their modes of release differ accordingly.
7.40.1.3.4.3	Figure 40.2 Three Classes of Hormones
7.40.1.4.1.1	Water-soluble hormones cannot pass readily through cell membranes; instead they bind to receptors on the surfaces of target cells.
7.40.1.4.1.2	These receptors are large transmembrane glycoprotein complexes with three domains:
7.40.1.4.2.1	A binding domain that projects outside the cell membrane
7.40.1.4.3.1	A transmembrane domain that anchors the receptor in the membrane
7.40.1.4.4.1	A cytoplasmic domain that extends into the cytoplasm of the cell
7.40.1.4.5.1	When a hormone binds to the binding domain, the cytoplasmic domain initiates the target cell&#8217;s response, usually through second messengers.
7.40.1.4.5.2	Second messengers activate a cascade of intracellular events, eventually activating protein kinases or protein phosphatases (see Figures 7.6 and 7.7).
7.40.1.4.5.3	In most cases these protein kinases and phosphatases activate or inactivate enzymes in the cytoplasm that lead to the cell&#8217;s response, but the signaling cascade initiated by the receptor can also generate signals that enter the nucleus and alter gene expression (see Figure 7.10).
7.40.1.4.6.1	Lipid-soluble hormones can diffuse through cell membranes, and therefore their receptors are usually inside cells, in either the cytoplasm or the nucleus.
7.40.1.4.6.2	There are also some membrane-bound receptors for lipid-soluble hormones, but they are the exception rather than the rule.
7.40.1.4.6.3	In most cases, the complex formed by the lipid-soluble hormone and its receptor acts by altering gene expression in the cell&#8217;s nucleus (see Figure 7.8).
7.40.1.5.1.1	Wherever a hormone encounters a cell with an appropriate receptor, it can bind to that receptor and trigger a response.
7.40.1.5.1.2	The nature of the response depends on the signal transduction pathways of the responding cell.
7.40.1.5.1.3	Therefore the same hormone can cause different responses in different types of cells.
7.40.1.5.2.1	Consider the amine hormone epinephrine, and the closely related amine hormone as well as neurotransmitter norepinephrine.
7.40.1.5.2.2	Both of these molecules are involved in the well-known fight-or-flight response (Figure 40.3).
7.40.1.5.2.3	Suppose you are walking in the forest and almost step on a rattlesnake.
7.40.1.5.2.4	You jump back, your heart starts to thump, and protective reactions are set in motion.
7.40.1.5.2.5	The jump and the heart thumping are driven by your rapidly responding sympathetic nervous system (see Figure 46.8) which uses norepinephrine to signal target cells.
7.40.1.5.2.6	Simultaneously with these muscular responses, your sympathetic nervous system stimulates endocrine cells in the adrenal glands just above your kidneys to secrete both epinephrine and norepinephrine.
7.40.1.5.2.7	These hormones rapidly diffuse into your blood and circulate around your body, activating the many components of the fight-or-flight response.
7.40.1.5.2.8	Figure 40.3 The Fight-or-Flight Response
7.40.1.5.3.1	Epinephrine and norepinephrine bind to receptors in your heart, causing a faster and stronger heartbeat.
7.40.1.5.3.2	Your heart is now pumping more blood.
7.40.1.5.3.3	Epinephrine also binds to receptors in certain blood vessels.
7.40.1.5.3.4	By causing constriction of blood vessels supplying your skin, kidneys, and digestive tract (digesting lunch can wait!), the hormone diverts more blood to the muscles needed for your escape from danger.
7.40.1.5.4.1	Epinephrine binds to cells in the liver, stimulating them to break down glycogen and release glucose into the blood as a quick energy supply (see Figure 7.15).
7.40.1.5.4.2	In fatty tissue, epinephrine stimulates the breakdown of fats to yield fatty acids&#8212;another source of energy.
7.40.1.5.4.3	These are just some of the actions triggered by one hormone.
7.40.1.5.4.4	In each case the cellular response depends on the cell&#8217;s receptors, its associated intracellular signaling cascade, and the mechanisms activated by that signaling cascade.
7.40.1.5.4.5	All of the diverse cellular responses activated by epinephrine and norepinephrine increase your chances of surviving a dangerous situation.
7.40.1.6.1.1	Intercellular chemical signaling was critical for the evolution of multicellularity, so hormones have a long evolutionary history.
7.40.1.6.1.2	The least complex of the multicellular animals&#8212;the sponges&#8212;do not have nervous systems, but they do have intercellular chemical communication.
7.40.1.6.1.3	Studying the evolution of hormonal signaling reveals an interesting generalization: the signal molecules themselves are highly conserved.
7.40.1.6.1.4	We find the same chemical compounds over broad groups of organisms, although their functions may differ.
7.40.1.6.1.5	As organisms have evolved to occupy different environments and have different lifestyles, the same hormone&#8211;receptor systems have diversified to serve different functions.
7.40.1.6.1.6	A good example of this evolutionary diversification is the hormone prolactin, described in Figure 40.4.
7.40.1.6.1.7	The name prolactin reflects the role this hormone plays in mammals to stimulate the growth of mammary glands and the production of milk.
7.40.1.6.1.8	Mammary glands are unique to mammals, but we find prolactin in all vertebrate groups&#8212;and in all cases it is involved in some way in reproduction.
7.40.1.6.1.9	Figure 40.4 Prolactin&#8217;s Structure Is Conserved, but Its Functions Have Evolved
7.40.1.6.2.1	The list of hormones known to exist is long and growing longer (as shown by the recent discovery of irisin).
7.40.1.6.2.2	To make the subject manageable, we will focus primarily on the endocrine system of mammals.
7.40.1.6.2.3	Figure 40.5 presents the human endocrine glands and most of the hormones that are discussed in this and subsequent chapters.
7.40.1.6.2.4	Figure 40.5 Chemical Signaling Systems
7.40.1.6.3.1	40.1 recap
7.40.1.6.4.1	Endocrine signals initiate responses in target cells that vary depending on the signal transduction pathways of the responding cell.
7.40.1.6.4.2	Autocrines and paracrines act locally.
7.40.1.6.4.3	Hormones are chemical signals released by endocrine cells into the extracellular fluid, where they diffuse into the blood and travel to distant target cells.
7.40.1.6.4.4	The receptors for water-soluble hormones are on the surfaces of target cells; receptors for most lipid-soluble hormones are inside the target cells.
7.40.1.6.4.5	The chemical structures of signal molecules have been highly conserved over evolutionary time, but the chemical compounds serve different functions in different organisms.
7.40.1.6.5.1	learning outcomes
7.40.1.6.6.1	You should be able to:
7.40.1.6.7.1	Describe the structural feature of hormones that determines whether they act on surface or cytoplasmic receptors.
7.40.1.6.8.1	Explain how different target cells in the body can respond differently to a single hormone.
7.40.1.6.9.1	Discuss scientific thinking about the evolutionary history of hormones in multicellular animals.
7.40.1.6.10.1	Why are the effects of epinephrine more rapid than the effects of estrogen?
7.40.1.6.11.1	Why is the presence of a particular hormone in two species not an indication of the closeness of their evolutionary relationship?
7.40.1.6.12.1	How can a single hormone have two different effects in the same species?
7.40.1.6.13.1	The advantage of hormone signals is that they can originate from a localized source but reach cells in all areas of the body and coordinate their activities.
7.40.1.6.13.2	The disadvantage of hormones is that they are relatively slow in delivering and in terminating their messages.
7.40.1.6.13.3	Thus they are not good for communicating rapidly changing information.
7.40.1.6.13.4	In contrast, the nervous system sends messages to specific target cells, and its messages are rapid and can be turned off quickly.
7.40.1.6.13.5	In addition, the nervous system has access to a great diversity of both external and internal information that indicates the state of the body and threats to homeostasis.
7.40.1.6.13.6	The different characteristics of each of these informational systems make it advantageous for them to work together.
7.40.1.6.14.1	Chapter 40 continues with
7.40.1.6.15.1	40.2 The Endocrine System and Nervous System Work Together
7.40.2.1.1	The pituitary is an interface between the nervous and endocrine systems
7.40.2.2.1	Hypothalamic neurohormones control the anterior pituitary
7.40.2.3.1	Negative feedback loops regulate hormone secretion
7.40.2.4.1	Hormones influence the nervous system
7.40.2.5.1	The nervous system and the endocrine system control and regulate virtually all physiological and behavioral mechanisms that contribute to homeostasis, survival, and reproductive success.
7.40.2.5.2	Challenges to an organism usually trigger both physiological and behavioral responses, as we saw with respect to thermoregulation in Chapter 39 and also with the fight-or-flight reactions shown in Figure 40.3.
7.40.2.5.3	Therefore the endocrine and nervous systems must work together in an integrated fashion, and indeed they do.
7.40.2.5.4	The nervous system receives an enormous amount of information from the body and from the environment.
7.40.2.5.5	That information is critical for maintenance of homeostasis, survival, and reproductive success.
7.40.2.5.6	The nervous system controls many tissue and organ functions as well as behavior.
7.40.2.5.7	It is therefore not surprising that the nervous system regulates many endocrine functions.
7.40.2.5.8	Conversely, hormones circulate to the nervous system, providing feedback information used in regulation.
7.40.2.5.9	Hormones reaching the brain also stimulate behaviors that contribute to the health and well being of an organism.
7.40.2.6.1	focus your learning
7.40.2.7.1	Oxytocin and vasopressin are produced in the hypothalamus and secreted from nerve terminals in the posterior pituitary.
7.40.2.8.1	The anterior pituitary produces four tropic hormones plus growth hormone, prolactin, and melanocyte stimulating hormone.
7.40.2.9.1	The release of hormones from the anterior pituitary is controlled by hypothalamic hormones transported to the pituitary in portal vessels.
7.40.2.10.1	Regulation involves short-loop and long-loop negative feedback.
7.40.2.1.1.1	The pituitary gland sits in a depression at the bottom of the skull, just over the back of the roof of the mouth (Figure 40.6).
7.40.2.1.1.2	It is attached by a stalk to the hypothalamus, which is involved in many physiological regulatory systems such as that of thermoregulation (see Key Concept 39.5).
7.40.2.1.1.3	Through its close connection with the hypothalamus, the pituitary serves as the interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system and is involved in the hormonal control of many physiological processes.
7.40.2.1.1.4	Figure 40.6 The Posterior Pituitary Releases Neurohormones
7.40.2.1.2.1	The pituitary has two parts with different developmental origins.
7.40.2.1.2.2	The anterior pituitary originates as an outpocketing of the roof of the embryonic mouth cavity.
7.40.2.1.2.3	The posterior pituitary originates as an outpocketing of the floor of the developing brain.
7.40.2.1.2.4	Thus the anterior pituitary originates from gut epithelial tissue and the posterior pituitary from neural tissue.
7.40.2.1.2.5	Both parts interact with the nervous system but in different ways.
7.40.2.1.2.6	The anterior pituitary is controlled by hypothalamic neurohormones that reach the anterior pituitary via the blood.
7.40.2.1.2.7	The posterior pituitary contains long extensions of hypothalamic neurons that release their neurohormones in the posterior pituitary.
7.40.2.1.1.1.1	The long hypothalamic neuron extensions into the posterior pituitary are called axons.
7.40.2.1.1.1.2	The terminals of these axons in the posterior pituitary contain vesicles of neurohormones&#8212;either antidiuretic hormone or oxytocin.
7.40.2.1.1.1.3	When these hypothalamic neurons are activated, they fire electrical signals (* action potentials) that travel down the axon and cause the release of the neurohormones (see Figure 40.6).
7.40.2.1.1.2.1	* connect the concepts As described in Key Concept 45.2, action potentials are sudden and transient electric signals generated by voltage-gated ion channels in the cell membrane of the axon.
7.40.2.1.1.2.2	These signals travel rapidly along axons, and their arrival at the axon terminals initiates the release of neurotransmitters.
7.40.2.1.1.3.1	The main action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) in mammals and birds is to increase the amount of water conserved by the kidneys.
7.40.2.1.1.3.2	When ADH secretion is high, the kidneys produce only a small volume of highly concentrated urine.
7.40.2.1.1.3.3	When ADH secretion is low, the kidneys produce a large volume of dilute urine.
7.40.2.1.1.3.4	The posterior pituitary increases its release of ADH when blood pressure falls or the blood becomes too salty.
7.40.2.1.1.3.5	ADH is also known as vasopressin because at high concentrations it causes the constriction of peripheral blood vessels as a means of elevating blood pressure.
7.40.2.1.1.4.1	The hormone oxytocin is released from the posterior pituitary when a woman is about to give birth.
7.40.2.1.1.4.2	Oxytocin stimulates contractions of the uterine muscles, resulting in the delivery of the baby.
7.40.2.1.1.4.3	Oxytocin also brings about the flow of milk from the mother&#8217;s breasts.
7.40.2.1.1.4.4	The baby&#8217;s suckling stimulates neurons in the mother&#8217;s brain that cause the secretion of oxytocin.
7.40.2.1.1.4.5	Even the crying of her baby can cause a nursing mother to secrete oxytocin, resulting in the release of breast milk&#8212;a good example of how the nervous system integrates information that regulates hormonally mediated processes.
7.40.2.1.2.1.1	The anterior pituitary produces and releases into the circulation four peptide and protein hormones that act as tropic hormones, meaning they control the activities of other endocrine glands.
7.40.2.1.2.1.2	These four tropic hormones are thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH).
7.40.2.1.2.1.3	Each is produced by a different type of pituitary cell.
7.40.2.1.2.1.4	We will say more about these tropic hormones when we describe their target glands&#8212;the thyroid, testes, ovaries, and adrenal cortex&#8212;later in this chapter and in Chapter 42.
7.40.2.1.2.1.5	Other peptide and protein hormones produced by the anterior pituitary are prolactin (see Figure 40.4), growth hormone, enkephalins and endorphins, and melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH).
7.40.2.1.2.2.1	Growth hormone (GH) acts on a wide variety of tissues to promote growth and development.
7.40.2.1.2.2.2	One of its important effects is to stimulate cells to take up amino acids.
7.40.2.1.2.2.3	Growth hormone also promotes growth by stimulating the liver to produce chemical signals that stimulate the growth of bone and cartilage.
7.40.2.1.2.2.4	Overproduction of GH in children causes gigantism; affected individuals may grow to nearly 8 feet tall.
7.40.2.1.2.2.5	Underproduction of GH results in pituitary dwarfism, in which individuals fail to reach normal adult height.
7.40.2.1.2.3.1	Endorphins and enkephalins are the body&#8217;s natural painkillers.
7.40.2.1.2.3.2	In the brain, these molecules act as neurotransmitters in pathways that control pain.
7.40.2.1.2.3.3	Their production in the anterior pituitary is normally quite small and probably has little significant effect.
7.40.2.1.2.4.1	Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) stimulates the production of the pigment melanin in skin and hair.
7.40.2.1.2.4.2	MSH is produced by a thin layer of cells between the anterior and posterior pituitary that is sometimes called the intermediate lobe of the pituitary.
7.40.2.2.1.1	Hypothalamic neurons do not extend into the anterior pituitary as they do into the posterior pituitary.
7.40.2.2.1.2	So how do the neurohormones produced by hypothalamic neurons reach the anterior pituitary cells they control?
7.40.2.2.1.3	The pituitary is connected to the brain by the pituitary stalk (Focus: Key Figure 40.7).
7.40.2.2.1.4	Within that stalk are hypothalamic&#8211;pituitary portal blood vessels.
7.40.2.2.1.5	The hypothalamic cells secrete neurohormones at the bottom of the hypothalamus where the stalk begins.
7.40.2.2.1.6	The neurohormones diffuse into the portal blood vessels that begin there, and are carried in the blood to where the portal vessels end in the anterior pituitary.
7.40.2.2.1.7	Hypothalamic neurohormones are released in such tiny amounts that they were only hypothesized to exist before the technology was developed to isolate and characterize their structure.
7.40.2.2.2.1	focus: key figure
7.40.2.2.3.1	Figure 40.7 The Anterior Pituitary Is Controlled by the Hypothalamus
7.40.2.2.4.1	Cells of the anterior pituitary produce tropic hormones that control other endocrine glands, as well as several other peptide and protein hormones.
7.40.2.2.4.2	These cells are controlled by neurohormones produced in the hypothalamus and are called releasing or release-inhibiting hormones.
7.40.2.2.4.3	These neurohormones are delivered through portal blood vessels that run between the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary through the pituitary stalk.
7.40.2.2.5.1	Q: Melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) is an anterior pituitary hormone (not shown in Figure 40.7A).
7.40.2.2.5.2	When anterior pituitary cells are grown in culture they release MSH into the medium.
7.40.2.2.5.3	If extracts of the hypothalamus are added to the medium, the release of MSH decreases.
7.40.2.2.5.4	What do these results tell you about the hypothalamic control over MSH producing cells?
7.40.2.2.6.1	In the 1960s two large teams of scientists led by Roger Guillemin and Andrew Schally initiated the search for these hypothalamic secretions.
7.40.2.2.6.2	Massive numbers of hypothalami from pigs and sheep were collected from slaughterhouses and shipped to laboratories.
7.40.2.2.6.3	One extraction effort began with the hypothalami from 270,000 sheep and yielded only 1 mg of purified thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH).
7.40.2.2.6.4	TRH was the first hypothalamic release-stimulating hormone to be isolated and characterized.
7.40.2.2.6.5	It turned out to be a simple tripeptide consisting of glutamine, histidine, and proline.
7.40.2.2.6.6	It causes certain anterior pituitary cells to release the tropic hormone thyrotropin, which in turn stimulates the activity of the thyroid gland.
7.40.2.2.7.1	Soon after discovering TRH, Guillemin&#8217;s and Schally&#8217;s teams identified gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates certain anterior pituitary cells to release the tropic hormones that control the activity of the gonads (the ovaries and the testes).
7.40.2.2.7.2	For these discoveries, Guillemin and Schally shared the 1977 Nobel Prize in Medicine with Rosalyn Yalow, who invented the technique of radioimmunoassay, which made possible the measurement of miniscule amounts of specific molecules such as releasing hormones.
7.40.2.2.8.1	Many other hypothalamic neurohormones, including both releasing and release-inhibiting hormones, are now known.
7.40.2.2.8.2	The major hypothalamic neurohormones that control anterior pituitary function are listed in Figure 40.7.
7.40.2.3.1.1	In addition to being controlled by hypothalamic releasing and release-inhibiting hormones, the endocrine cells of the anterior pituitary are also under direct and indirect negative feedback control by the hormones of the target glands they stimulate (see Figure 40.7).
7.40.2.3.1.2	For example, cortisol, produced by the adrenal gland in response to ACTH secreted by the anterior pituitary, reaches the pituitary in the circulating blood and inhibits further release of ACTH.
7.40.2.3.1.3	Cortisol also acts as a negative feedback signal to the hypothalamus, inhibiting the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH).
7.40.2.3.1.4	Because cortisol is the final hormone released in this chain of interacting structures called the hypothalamic&#8211;pituitary&#8211;adrenal axis, its feedback actions are called long-loop negative feedback.
7.40.2.3.1.5	In this system, the tropic hormone ACTH also exerts negative feedback control on the hypothalamic cells that produce the corresponding releasing hormone (CRH).
7.40.2.3.1.6	This action is called short-loop negative feedback because of the proximity of the pituitary and the hypothalamus.
7.40.2.4.1.1	Hormones have more influences on the nervous system than simply being negative feedback signals controlling their own secretion.
7.40.2.4.1.2	For example, the posterior pituitary hormone oxytocin, which plays a role in the birth process and in stimulating the flow of milk from the breasts, also has a strong behavioral effect in promoting bonding (see the story that opens Chapter 7).
7.40.2.4.1.3	If oxytocin release is experimentally blocked, mammalian mothers, from rats to sheep, will reject their newborn offspring, but if a virgin rat is given a dose of oxytocin, she will adopt strange pups as if they were her own.
7.40.2.4.1.4	Oxytocin promotes pair bonding in a variety of animals.
7.40.2.4.1.5	In humans, oxytocin secretion rises with intimate sexual contact, and it has been nicknamed the &#8220;cuddle hormone. &#8221; Experiments using games involving financial exchanges have shown that puffs of oxytocin applied to the nostrils raise the level of trust between players.
7.40.2.4.1.6	Thus circulating hormones can have a strong influence on behavior.
7.40.2.4.1.7	Another example is the effects of sex hormones, which we will discuss in Key Concept 53.3.
7.40.2.4.2.1	Recent investigations involving the hormone irisin that was presented at the beginning of this chapter reveal that this same molecule may mediate effects of exercise on the brain.
7.40.2.4.2.2	Many experiments have shown that exercise improves cognitive functions.
7.40.2.4.2.3	Beneficial effects of exercise have been shown especially for a part of the brain called the hippocampus that is involved in learning and memory.
7.40.2.4.2.4	These effects include the production of new brain cells, increased blood flow, and changes in the structures supporting communication between brain cells.
7.40.2.4.2.5	It had been established that one molecular factor involved in the beneficial effects of exercise on the hippocampus is BDNF, which stands for brain-derived neurotrophic factor.
7.40.2.4.2.6	How does exercise mediate the release of BDNF in the brain?
7.40.2.4.2.7	Investigating Life: How Could Irisin Mediate the Benefits of Exercise on Cognition? explores this interesting question.

7.40.2.4.4.1	How Could Irisin Mediate the Benefits of Exercise on Cognition?
7.40.2.4.5.1	experiment
7.40.2.4.6.1	Original Paper: Wrann, C. D. et al. 2013.
7.40.2.4.6.2	Exercise induces hippocampal BDNF through a PGC-1&#945;/FNDC5 pathway.
7.40.2.4.6.3	Cell Metabolism 18: 649&#8211;659.
7.40.2.4.7.1	Irisin secreted by exercising muscle is cleaved from a protein called FNDC5, and FNDC5 expression is controlled by the transcription factor PGC-1&#945;.
7.40.2.4.7.2	Irisin then circulates in the blood, but because of the blood&#8211;brain barrier (see Key Concept 44.1), it is unlikely to reach brain structures such as the hippocampus where it could enhance cognition.
7.40.2.4.7.3	However, could irisin also be expressed in the brain?
7.40.2.4.7.4	If so, exercise should result in similar changes in expression of FNDC5 and its transcription factor PGC-1&#945; in the hippocampus as it does in skeletal muscle.
7.40.2.4.7.5	First, we need to show in our experimental system and with our assays that exercise induces expression of PGC-1&#945; and FNDC5 in exercising muscle.
7.40.2.4.7.6	Then we can use the same experimental system to investigate expression in the hippocampus.
7.40.2.4.8.1	HYPOTHESIS Endurance exercise results in increased expression of PGC-1&#945; and FNDC5 in skeletal muscle.
7.40.2.4.9.1	METHOD
7.40.2.4.10.1	Have one group of mice exercise on running wheels for 30 days and a control group that does not.
7.40.2.4.10.2	N = 10 for each group.
7.40.2.4.11.1	At the end of 30 days, measure PGC-1&#945; and FNDC5 mRNA levels in leg muscle of both groups of mice.
7.40.2.4.12.1	Plot the data for each variable (FNDC5 and PGC-1&#945;) for the exercised and control mice, and use an un-paired t-test (see Appendix B) to evaluate the significance of the results.
7.40.2.4.13.1	RESULTS Error bars indicate &#177; 1 standard deviation.
7.40.2.4.14.1	CONCLUSION Relative levels of FNDC5 mRNA were significantly higher in the exercised than in the non-exercised mice (P &#60; 0.001).
7.40.2.4.14.2	Relative levels of PGC-1&#945; mRNA also were significantly higher in the exercised than in the non-exercised mice (P &#60; 0.01).
7.40.2.4.15.1	work with the data
7.40.2.4.16.1	Similar measurements of expression of FNDC5 and PGC-1&#945; mRNAs were made from the hippocampus of the exercised and the non-exercised mice.
7.40.2.4.16.2	Again, N = 10 for each group.
7.40.2.4.16.3	The results are shown in the table.

7.40.2.4.17.1	QUESTIONS
7.40.2.4.18.1	Plot the data as was done for the leg skeletal muscle results.
7.40.2.4.18.2	Then you can apply the same analysis methods to these data that were applied to the leg muscle data in the preceding experiment.
7.40.2.4.18.3	Did exercise have a significant effect on FNDC5 and PGC-1&#945; expression in the hippocampus?
7.40.2.4.19.1	The neurotrophic factor BDNF is a secreted protein that plays important roles in neural changes associated with learning and memory.
7.40.2.4.19.2	How would you determine if the exercise protocol induced a significant increase in BDNF expression in the hippocampus, assuming you have an assay for BDNF?
7.40.2.4.20.1	How could you determine if a noted increase in the expression of FNDC5 in the hippocampus is sufficient for an increased expression of BDNF in the hippocampus?
7.40.2.4.20.2	Assume you can culture hippocampal neurons so that the expression of FNDC5 is stimulated or suppressed.
7.40.2.4.21.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.40.2.4.22.1	40.2 recap
7.40.2.4.23.1	The pituitary is the interface between the nervous system and the endocrine system.
7.40.2.4.23.2	The posterior pituitary releases two neurohormones, antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin.
7.40.2.4.23.3	The anterior pituitary, under the control of other neurohormones from the hypothalamus, releases four tropic hormones that control other endocrine glands.
7.40.2.4.23.4	In addition, the anterior pituitary produces and releases five other hormones that act directly on non-endocrine tissues.
7.40.2.4.23.5	The hypothalamus and pituitary are under negative feedback control by the hormones of their target glands.
7.40.2.4.24.1	learning outcomes
7.40.2.4.25.1	You should be able to:
7.40.2.4.26.1	Describe the relationships between the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland.
7.40.2.4.27.1	Explain developmental origins of the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary.
7.40.2.4.28.1	Explain how a negative feedback loop controls hormone secretion.
7.40.2.4.29.1	Provide a developmental explanation of why posterior pituitary hormones are released from neurons and anterior pituitary hormones are released from epithelial cells.
7.40.2.4.30.1	How do hypothalamic neurons control the release of hormones from the anterior pituitary?
7.40.2.4.31.1	Explain what is meant by negative feedback in the hypothalamic control of endocrine function.
7.40.2.4.32.1	The hypothalamic and pituitary hormones and some of the endocrine glands they control are easy to conceptualize because they share common features in how they are organized and function.
7.40.2.4.32.2	But the entire list of hormones is highly diverse, making generalizations difficult.
7.40.2.4.32.3	We cannot consider all of the hormones in this chapter.
7.40.2.4.32.4	Instead, we focus on hormones that have some common functions&#8212;one of which is the coordination of developmental processes.
7.40.2.4.33.1	Chapter 40 continues with
7.40.2.4.34.1	40.3 Hormones Play Important Roles in Development
7.40.3.1.1	Insect development consists of either complete or incomplete metamorphosis
7.40.3.2.1	Experiments on insect development revealed hormonal signaling systems
7.40.3.3.1	Three hormones regulate molting and maturationin arthropods
7.40.3.4.1	Sex steroids control sexual development
7.40.3.5.1	The development of an animal from a fertilized egg requires the coordination of processes throughout the body.
7.40.3.5.2	Imagine the problems that would arise if growth of the body were not symmetrical, or if the growth of organ systems did not match the demands placed on them by the growing body.
7.40.3.5.3	Because hormones circulate in the blood to all parts of the body, they are ideal signals for integrating and coordinating the many diverse processes involved in development.
7.40.3.6.1	focus your learning
7.40.3.7.1	Classic experiments revealed that hormones control insect metamorphosis.
7.40.3.8.1	Vertebrate sexual development is controlled by steroid hormones.
7.40.3.9.1	Human puberty results from a change in sensitivity of the hypothalamus to negative feedback.
7.40.3.1.1.1	The changes that occur in a developing insect can be dramatic and involve major changes in body form.
7.40.3.1.1.2	Insects such as bees and butterflies undergo a developmental process called complete metamorphosis.
7.40.3.1.1.3	Starting out as a caterpillar (a larva), a butterfly feeds voraciously and goes through a series of growth stages called instars, which are separated by molts.
7.40.3.1.1.4	The last instar builds a cocoon and enters into a quiescent, transformative state called a pupa.
7.40.3.1.1.5	The tissues of the pupa are extensively remodeled to form the adult body, which is entirely different from that of the larva.
7.40.3.1.1.6	The larval butterfly crawls and eats vegetation; the adult butterfly flies and eats flower nectar.
7.40.3.1.1.7	Many other species of insects undergo incomplete metamorphosis, which involves less extreme changes of body form.
7.40.3.1.1.8	These insects also go through a series of instars, getting bigger with each molt, but the last juvenile instar simply molts into the adult form with all of the essential adult body parts.
7.40.3.1.1.9	Molting involves shedding the skin, or in many cases the rigid exoskeletons, and therefore requires coordination of cellular processes in the entire epidermis of the animal.
7.40.3.1.1.10	Both complete and incomplete * metamorphosis require integrated processes in all parts of the insect body.
7.40.3.1.2.1	* connect the concepts Insect metamorphosis is described in more detail at the end of Key Concept 32.4.
7.40.3.2.1.1	Pioneering experiments of hormonal action and control in insects were done on the bloodsucking bug Rhodnius prolixus, which undergoes incomplete metamorphosis.
7.40.3.2.1.2	Newly hatched Rhodnius lack certain adult features and molt five times before developing into a mature adult.
7.40.3.2.1.3	A blood meal triggers each episode of molting and growth.
7.40.3.2.1.4	Rhodnius is an amazingly hardy experimental animal&#8212;it survives for quite a long time after its head is cut off.
7.40.3.2.1.5	If decapitated within an hour after a blood meal, Rhodnius can survive for up to a year, but it never molts.
7.40.3.2.1.6	If decapitated a week after its blood meal, however, it does molt into an adult.
7.40.3.2.2.1	This observation suggested that molting was triggered by some substance slowly diffusing from the head.
7.40.3.2.2.2	To test this hypothesis, two decapitated bugs&#8211;one soon after a blood meal and one a week after a blood meal&#8211;were connected together with a glass tube that allowed body fluids to cross between the two bugs.
7.40.3.2.2.3	Both molted into adults proving that a diffusible substance from the bug&#8217;s head triggered molting.
7.40.3.2.3.1	Since those pioneering experiments on Rhodnius, the chemical nature of the diffusible substances (hormones) controlling molting in arthropods have been identified and their functions described.
7.40.3.3.1.1	An arthropod&#8217;s nervous system receives various types of information about the environment (e. g. , day length, temperature, social cues, and nutrition) that help determine the optimal timing for the stages of growth and development.
7.40.3.3.1.2	When conditions are right, the brain signals the prothoracic gland to produce the hormones that orchestrate physiological processes involved in development and molting.
7.40.3.3.1.1.1	Two hormones, prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) and ecdysone, work in sequence to regulate molting in arthropods.
7.40.3.3.1.1.2	Cells in the brain produce PTTH, which is why it has also been called &#8220;brain hormone. &#8221; PTTH is transported to and stored in paired structures called the corpora cardiaca attached to the brain (Figure 40.8).
7.40.3.3.1.1.3	After appropriate stimulation (which for Rhodnius is a blood meal), PTTH is released and diffuses through the extracellular fluid to an endocrine gland, the prothoracic gland.
7.40.3.3.1.1.4	PTTH stimulates the prothoracic gland to secrete the hormone ecdysone.
7.40.3.3.1.1.5	Ecdysone diffuses to target tissues and stimulates molting.
7.40.3.3.1.2.1	Figure 40.8 Hormonal Control of Metamorphosis
7.40.3.3.1.3.1	Ecdysone is a steroid hormone (see Figure 40.2B) and thus is related to the vertebrate hormones estrogen and testosterone (which also play roles in controlling growth and development).
7.40.3.3.1.3.2	Ecdysone is lipid-soluble and readily passes through the cell membrane of its target cells (mostly cells of the epidermis).
7.40.3.3.1.3.3	In the target cells, ecdysone binds to a receptor that induces expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in digesting the old cuticle and secreting a new one.
7.40.3.3.2.1.1	What determines whether an instar molts into another juvenile form or matures into an adult?
7.40.3.3.2.1.2	Juvenile hormone is a molecule that is released continuously from the corpora allata (structures that are attached to the corpora cardiaca, which release PTTH).
7.40.3.3.2.1.3	As long as juvenile hormone is present, Rhodnius molts into another juvenile instar.
7.40.3.3.2.1.4	Normally Rhodnius stops producing juvenile hormone during the fifth instar and then molts into an adult.
7.40.3.3.2.2.1	The role of juvenile hormone is more complex in insects that undergo complete metamorphosis.
7.40.3.3.2.2.2	An example of complete metamorphosis is provided by the silkworm moth Hyalophora cecropia (see Figure 40.8).
7.40.3.3.2.2.3	As long as juvenile hormone is present in high concentrations, larvae molt into larger larvae.
7.40.3.3.2.2.4	When the level of juvenile hormone falls, larvae spin cocoons and molt into pupae.
7.40.3.3.2.2.5	Because no juvenile hormone is produced in pupae, they molt into adults.
7.40.3.3.2.2.6	Many modern pesticides use juvenile hormone analogs to prevent larvae developing into adults.
7.40.3.3.2.3.1	These cases of insect development show how just a few hormones can coordinate major developmental effects that involve very different cell types and tissues in the body.
7.40.3.3.2.3.2	The hormonal signals reach all parts of the body simultaneously, and depending on the receptors on different cell types and the internal mechanisms driven by those receptors, the developmental processes are orchestrated.
7.40.3.4.1.1	Hormones also control many developmental processes in vertebrates.
7.40.3.4.1.2	One example already mentioned in Key Concept 40.2 is the influence that the anterior pituitary growth hormone has on growth.
7.40.3.4.1.3	Other examples are the hormones involved in sex development.
7.40.3.4.1.4	The gonads&#8212;the testes of the male and the ovaries of the female&#8212;produce hormones as well as sperm and ova.
7.40.3.4.1.5	The male steroid hormones are collectively called androgens, and the dominant hormone is testosterone.
7.40.3.4.1.6	The female steroids are estrogens and progesterone.
7.40.3.4.1.7	The dominant estrogen is estradiol, which is synthesized from testosterone.
7.40.3.4.1.8	Males and females both synthesize testosterone, but females have an enzyme (aromatase) that converts testosterone to estradiol.
7.40.3.4.1.1.1	The sex steroids determine whether a mammalian embryo develops into a phenotypic female or male.
7.40.3.4.1.1.2	In humans, the gonads of an early embryo are undifferentiated.
7.40.3.4.1.1.3	Beginning in about the seventh week of development, the expression of genes on the Y chromosome of an XY individual normally causes the undifferentiated gonads to produce androgens.
7.40.3.4.1.1.4	In response to androgens, the reproductive system develops the male phenotype.
7.40.3.4.1.1.5	If no Y chromosome is present (i. e. , the individual is genotype XX), androgens are not produced at this time and female structures develop (Figure 40.09).
7.40.3.4.1.1.6	After birth, the sex steroids control the maturation of the reproductive organs and the development and maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics, such as breasts and facial hair.
7.40.3.4.1.2.1	Figure 40.9 Sex Steroids Direct the Development of Human Sex Organs
7.40.3.4.1.3.1	Q: What do you think the effect of a mutation that results in nonfunctional androgen receptors would be?
7.40.3.4.1.4.1	Phenotypic sex determination provides a good example of the importance of receptors in hormonal control mechanisms.
7.40.3.4.1.4.2	Individuals are occasionally born who because of a mutation do not have functional androgen receptors&#8212;a condition called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
7.40.3.4.1.4.3	These individuals have an XY genotype and internal testes, but they develop the external body form and genitalia of a female.
7.40.3.4.2.1.1	In juvenile humans, the sex steroids are produced at low levels.
7.40.3.4.2.1.2	At puberty (around age 12 or 13), sex steroid production increases rapidly.
7.40.3.4.2.1.3	Why does this sudden increase occur?
7.40.3.4.2.1.4	In both juvenile and adult humans, the activities of the gonads are controlled by the anterior pituitary tropic hormones luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which together are the gonadotropins.
7.40.3.4.2.1.5	The production of gonadotropins by the anterior pituitary is under the control of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) produced by the hypothalamus (Figure 40.10).
7.40.3.4.2.1.6	The production of GnRH is controlled by negative feedback from circulating sex steroids.
7.40.3.4.2.1.7	Before puberty, the hypothalamus is very sensitive to that negative feedback signal, even though the circulating levels of sex steroids are low, and only low levels of GnRH are released.
7.40.3.4.2.1.8	Puberty is initiated by a reduction in the sensitivity of hypothalamic GnRH-producing cells to negative feedback.
7.40.3.4.2.1.9	As a result, GnRH production increases, stimulating increased production of gonadotropins and hence increased production of sex steroids.
7.40.3.4.2.1.10	Figure 40.10 The Trigger for Puberty
7.40.3.4.2.2.1	In females, increasing levels of LH and FSH at puberty stimulate the ovaries to increase their production of the female sex hormones.
7.40.3.4.2.2.2	The increased circulating levels of these hormones stimulate the devel-opment of the traits of a sexually mature woman: enlarged breasts, vagina, and uterus; broadened hips; increased subcutaneous fat; pubic hair; onseet of menstrual and ovarian cycles (see Figure 42.11), and behavioral changes.
7.40.3.4.2.2.3	In males, an increasing level of LH stimulates groups of cells in the testes to increase their synthesis of testosterone, which in turn initiates the physiological, anatomical, and behavioral changes associated with adolescence.
7.40.3.4.2.2.4	The voice deepens, hair begins to grow on the face and body, and the testes and penis grow larger.
7.40.3.4.2.2.5	Testosterone also stimulates bone and skeletal muscle growth.
7.40.3.4.2.2.6	FSH in males stimulates production of sperm.
7.40.3.4.2.3.1	The roles that sex steroids play in adult sexual behavior and reproduction will be described in Chapter 42.
7.40.3.4.2.4.1	40.3 recap
7.40.3.4.2.5.1	Hormones play major roles in development.
7.40.3.4.2.5.2	Because they circulate throughout the body, they can simultaneously affect many cells and tissues, but in different ways depending on the receptors and intracellular pathways in those cells.
7.40.3.4.2.5.3	Thus hormones can coordinate the complex sets of responses involved in development.
7.40.3.4.2.5.4	Arthropod development involves complete or incomplete metamorphosis controlled by ecdysone, juvenile hormone, and prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH).
7.40.3.4.2.5.5	Human gonadal and phenotypic sex development is controlled by steroid hormones.

7.40.3.4.2.7.1	You should be able to:
7.40.3.4.2.8.1	Analyze observations made during experiments of arthropod development.
7.40.3.4.2.9.1	Explain how an individual can have a male genotype but female body characteristics and genitalia.
7.40.3.4.2.10.1	Explain the role of negative feedback in the timing of puberty in humans.
7.40.3.4.2.11.1	Why did decapitation of Rhodnius prevent molting when done 1 hour after feeding but not when done 1 week after feeding?
7.40.3.4.2.12.1	How can a person with an XY genotype develop with the phenotype of a female?
7.40.3.4.2.13.1	What is tthe role of negative feedback in the timing of puberty?
7.40.3.4.2.14.1	A common feature of the roles of hormones in development is that they coordinate the execution of events programmed into the genome.
7.40.3.4.2.14.2	These functions have evolved to be rather stable in the face of changes in the internal and external environments.
7.40.3.4.2.14.3	In contrast, hormones involved in maintaining homeostasis of the internal environment have evolved to be very sensitive to changes in the internal or external environment that could compromise homeostasis.
7.40.3.4.2.14.4	We will look at some of these hormonal regulatory mechanisms in the next section.
7.40.3.4.2.15.1	Chapter 40 continues with
7.40.3.4.2.16.1	40.4 Hormones Regulate Metabolism and the Internal Environment
7.40.4.1.1	Thyroxine stimulates many metabolic processes
7.40.4.2.1	Three hormones regulate blood calcium concentrations
7.40.4.3.1	PTH lowers blood phosphate levels
7.40.4.4.1	Insulin and glucagon regulate blood glucose concentrations
7.40.4.5.1	The adrenal gland is two glands in one
7.40.4.6.1	Many chemicals may act as hormones
7.40.4.7.1	The pineal gland has a daily cycle of melatonin release
7.40.4.8.1	Hormones participate in regulation in all physiological systems.
7.40.4.8.2	In this section we will examine a few major examples of hormonal action that are critical in regulating the internal environment.
7.40.4.8.3	For simplicity we will focus on humans, but these systems are similar in all mammals.
7.40.4.9.1	focus your learning
7.40.4.10.1	The thyroid gland secretes the hormone thyroxine, which has multiple effects on metabolism, and calcitonin, which reduces blood calcium levels.
7.40.4.11.1	Calcitriol increases blood calcium.
7.40.4.12.1	Clusters of endocrine cells called islets of Langerhans in the pancreas secrete the hormones insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin.
7.40.4.13.1	The adrenal gland consists of the adrenal medulla, which secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine, and the adrenal cortex, which secretes steroid hormones.
7.40.4.1.1.1	Thyroxine is produced and secreted by the thyroid gland.
7.40.4.1.1.2	This gland wraps around the front of the windpipe (trachea) and expands into a lobe on either side (see Figures 40.5 and 40.12).
7.40.4.1.1.3	There are two cell types in the thyroid gland, each of which produces a specific hormone.
7.40.4.1.1.4	Thyroxine is produced by epithelial cells that make up round, colloid-containing structures called follicles (Figure 40.11A).
7.40.4.1.1.5	Calcitonin is produced by cells in the spaces between the follicles and is involved in blood calcium regulation (which we will describe shortly).
7.40.4.1.1.6	Figure 40.11 The ThyroidGland Consists of Many Follicles
7.40.4.1.2.1	Thyroxine, a crucial signal in the regulation of cellular energy metabolism, begins as the glycoprotein thyroglobulin, which is synthesized by the follicle cells and packaged in secretory vesicles.
7.40.4.1.2.2	The follicle cells actively take up iodide from the blood and move it into the lumen of the follicle (Figure 40.11B).
7.40.4.1.2.3	Each thyroglobulin molecule contains about 100 tyrosine units.
7.40.4.1.2.4	When the secretory vesicles release thyroglobulin into the lumen of the follicle, they also release an enzyme that catalyzes the iodination of the tyrosine units in the thyroglobulin.
7.40.4.1.2.5	When the thyroid gland is stimulated to release thyroxine, the follicle cells take up thyroglobulin from the follicle by endocytosis.
7.40.4.1.2.6	These bits of thyroglobulin are then cleaved to form smaller molecules consisting of only two tyrosine units, and these molecules leave the follicle cells and enter the blood.
7.40.4.1.2.7	If these molecules are iodinated at the maximum of four sites on the tyrosine units, the hormone is tetraiodothyronine, or T4:
7.40.4.1.3.1	and if they are iodinated at only three sites, they are triiodothyronine, or T3:
7.40.4.1.4.1	The thyroid usually releases about ten times as much T4 as T3.
7.40.4.1.4.2	However, T3 is a more active hormone than T4, so when you read about the effects of thyroxine, keep in mind that the actions discussed are primarily those of T3.
7.40.4.1.4.3	The difference in the activities of T3 and T4 makes it possible to control the effects of thyroxine in different tissues.
7.40.4.1.4.4	Within target cells, T4 can be converted to T3 by an enzyme called deiodinase.
7.40.4.1.4.5	A different deiodinase can convert T4 into an inactive hormone called reverse T3.
7.40.4.1.4.6	Deiodinase can also inactivate T3 by converting it into T2 or T1.
7.40.4.1.4.7	Thus each target cell can set a unique sensitivity to thyroid hormones using these enzymes to control the conversion of T4 to T3 or to reverse T3.
7.40.4.1.1.1.1	The tropic hormone thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, also known as thyrotropin), produced by the anterior pituitary, activates the thyroxine-producing follicle cells in the thyroid.
7.40.4.1.1.1.2	Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), produced in the hypothalamus and transported to the anterior pituitary through the portal blood vessels, activates the TSH-producing pituitary cells.
7.40.4.1.1.1.3	The hypothalamus uses environmental information, such as temperature or day length, to determine whether to increase or decrease its secretion of TRH.
7.40.4.1.1.1.4	This sequence of steps is regulated by a negative feedback loop (see Figure 40.7B).
7.40.4.1.1.1.5	Circulating thyroxine inhibits the response of pituitary cells to TRH, so less TSH is released when thyroxine levels are high, and more TSH is released when thyroxine levels are low.
7.40.4.1.1.1.6	Circulating thyroxine also exerts negative feedback on the production and release of TRH by the hypothalamus.
7.40.4.1.1.2.1	Because thyroxine is lipid-soluble, it enters cells readily and binds to receptors in the nucleus.
7.40.4.1.1.2.2	When combined with thyroxine, these receptors (which are found in most cells of the body) stimulate the transcription of numerous genes whose products are transport proteins, structural proteins, and enzymes involved in metabolic pathways; thus thyroxine elevates the metabolic rates of most cells and tissues.
7.40.4.1.1.2.3	Exposure to cold for several days leads to an increased release of thyroxine, an increased conversion of T4 to T3, and therefore an increased basal metabolic rate (see Key Concept 39.5).
7.40.4.1.1.3.1	During development and growth, thyroxine promotes amino acid uptake and protein synthesis.
7.40.4.1.1.3.2	Insufficient thyroxine in a human fetus or growing child greatly retards physical and mental development, resulting in a condition known as cretinism.
7.40.4.1.2.1.1	A goiter is an enlarged thyroid gland (Figure 40.12) that can be associated with either hyperthyroidism (excess production of thyroxine) or hypothyroidism (thyroxine deficiency).
7.40.4.1.2.1.2	The negative feedback loop whereby thyroxine controls TSH release helps explain how two seemingly opposite conditions can result in the same symptom.
7.40.4.1.2.1.3	Figure 40.12 A Hypothyroid Goiter
7.40.4.1.2.2.1	The most common cause of hyperthyroid goiter is Graves&#8217; disease, an autoimmune disease involving an antibody to the TSH receptor.
7.40.4.1.2.2.2	This antibody binds to and activates the TSH receptors on the follicle cells, causing uncontrolled production and release of thyroxine.
7.40.4.1.2.2.3	Blood levels of TSH are low due to negative feedback from high levels of thyroxine, but the thyroid remains maximally stimulated and grows bigger.
7.40.4.1.2.2.4	People with hyperthyroidism have high metabolic rates, usually feel hot, and may develop a buildup of fat behind the eyeballs that causes their eyes to bulge.
7.40.4.1.2.3.1	Hypothyroid goiter results when there is not enough circulating thyroxine to turn off TSH production.
7.40.4.1.2.3.2	The most common cause is a deficiency of dietary iodide, without which the follicle cells cannot make thyroxine.
7.40.4.1.2.3.3	Without sufficient thyroxine, TSH levels remain high and the thyroid continues to produce large amounts of thyroglobulin.
7.40.4.1.2.3.4	Because sufficient iodine is not available, however, the thyroglobulin is poorly iodinated.
7.40.4.1.2.3.5	When it is broken down by the follicle cells, it produces little functional T3 or T4.
7.40.4.1.2.3.6	TSH levels remain high and stimulate more and more synthesis of thyroglobulin, and the thyroid gets bigger.
7.40.4.1.2.3.7	The symptoms of hypothyroidism are low metabolism, intolerance of cold, and general physical and mental sluggishness.
7.40.4.1.2.4.1	Goiter affects about 5 percent of the world&#8217;s population.
7.40.4.1.2.4.2	The addition of iodide to table salt has greatly reduced the incidence of hypothyroid goiter in industrialized nations, but the condition is still common in other parts of the world and is a leading cause of intellectual impairment.
7.40.4.2.1.1	The regulation of calcium concentration in the blood is crucial, and shifts in blood calcium concentration above or below a narrow range can cause serious problems.
7.40.4.2.1.2	When blood calcium falls below this range, the nervous system becomes overly excited, resulting in muscle spasms and even seizures.
7.40.4.2.1.3	When blood calcium rises above this range, the nervous system becomes depressed and muscles&#8212;including the heart&#8212;weaken.
7.40.4.2.1.4	Regulation of blood calcium is difficult because only about 0.1 percent of the calcium in the body is located in the extracellular fluid.
7.40.4.2.1.5	About 1 percent is in cells, and almost 99 percent is in the bones.
7.40.4.2.1.6	Therefore the body must maintain a tiny pool of calcium in the blood at a precise concentration, and that tiny pool can be influenced greatly by relatively small shifts in the much larger pools of calcium in the cells and bones.
7.40.4.2.2.1	The body has multiple mechanisms for changing blood calcium levels, including:
7.40.4.2.3.1	Deposition or absorption of bone
7.40.4.2.4.1	Excretion or retention of calcium by the kidneys
7.40.4.2.5.1	Absorption of calcium from the digestive tract
7.40.4.2.6.1	These mechanisms are controlled by three hormones: calcitonin, parathyroid hormone, and calcitriol (synthesized from vitamin D).
7.40.4.2.1.1.1	Calcitonin is released by the thyroid and lowers the concentration of calcium in the blood, mainly by regulating bone turnover (Figure 40.13).
7.40.4.2.1.1.2	Bone is continuously remodeled through a dynamic process that involves both resorption of old bone and synthesis of new bone, as we will discuss in Key Concept 47.3.
7.40.4.2.1.1.3	Cells called osteoclasts break down bone and release calcium into the blood, and cells called osteoblasts take up calcium from the blood and deposit it in new bone.
7.40.4.2.1.1.4	Calcitonin decreases the activity of osteoclasts and thereby favors removal of calcium from the blood and its deposition in bone by osteoblasts.
7.40.4.2.1.1.5	The turnover of bone in adult humans is not very high, so calcitonin does not play a major role in calcium homeostasis in adults.
7.40.4.2.1.1.6	It is probably more important in young individuals whose bones are actively growing.
7.40.4.2.1.1.7	Figure 40.13 Hormonal Regulation of Calcium
7.40.4.2.2.1.1	The parathyroid glands are four tiny structures embedded in the posterior surface of the thyroid gland (see Figure 40.13).
7.40.4.2.2.1.2	Their single hormone product, parathyroid hormone (PTH, also called parathormone), is the most important hormone in the regulation of blood calcium levels.
7.40.4.2.2.1.3	Circulating calcium activates receptors in the cell membrane of the parathyroid cells.
7.40.4.2.2.1.4	When these receptors are active, they inhibit the synthesis and release of PTH.
7.40.4.2.2.1.5	A fall in blood calcium removes this inhibition and triggers the synthesis and release of PTH.
7.40.4.2.2.1.6	PTH stimulates bone turnover by actions on both osteoclasts and osteoblasts.
7.40.4.2.2.1.7	The end result of these actions of PTH is a net increase of calcium in the blood.
7.40.4.2.2.1.8	PTH also maintains blood concentration of calcium by stimulating the kidneys to reabsorb it rather than excrete it in the urine.
7.40.4.2.3.1.1	It had long been known that fragile bones were common among people living at high latitudes, where winter days are short and the winter diet often lacks fish, dairy products, and fresh vegetables.
7.40.4.2.3.1.2	Since the condition could be reversed by taking cod-liver oil, it was assumed that a vitamin deficiency was involved.
7.40.4.2.3.1.3	That vitamin was named vitamin D, but when its chemical identity was established, this molecule turned out not to be a vitamin at all.
7.40.4.2.3.2.1	A vitamin is a substance that the body requires in small quantities but cannot synthesize for itself and must therefore obtain from food (or from supplements such as vitamin pills).
7.40.4.2.3.2.2	However, vitamin D&#8212;now more accurately named calciferol&#8212;is synthesized naturally from cholesterol when skin cells receive ultraviolet light.
7.40.4.2.3.2.3	Calciferol is not an active hormone, but through actions of the liver and kidneys it is converted into the active form called calcitriol, which circulates in the blood and acts on distant cells (and therefore is a hormone).
7.40.4.2.3.2.4	The conversion of calciferol to calcitriol is activated by PTH.
7.40.4.2.3.2.5	Calcitriol promotes the absorption of calcium from food in the gut.
7.40.4.2.3.2.6	Thus the combined actions of PTH and calcitriol raise blood calcium levels.
7.40.4.3.1.1	Bones are made of phosphate as well as calcium.
7.40.4.3.1.2	When PTH stimulates the release of calcium from bone, it also releases phosphate.
7.40.4.3.1.3	Normal blood concentrations of calcium and phosphate are just below the levels at which they precipitate out of solution as calcium phosphate salts.
7.40.4.3.1.4	Even a small rise in concentrations may cause precipitation that leads to maladies such as kidney stones and calcium deposits in the arteries (hardening of the arteries).
7.40.4.3.1.5	To reduce this risk, PTH acts on the kidneys to increase the elimination of phosphate via the urine.
7.40.4.4.1.1	Before the 1920s, the disease diabetes mellitus was fatal.
7.40.4.4.1.2	Characterized by weakness, lethargy, and a dramatic loss of body mass, this condition was known to be connected somehow with the pancreas&#8212;a large gland located just below the stomach (see Figure 40.5)&#8212;and with abnormal glucose metabolism.
7.40.4.4.1.3	The exact links, however, were not clear.
7.40.4.4.2.1	Today we know there are two forms of diabetes mellitus.
7.40.4.4.2.2	The form that was mostly seen prior to the 1920s usually occurred in young people and was called juvenile diabetes.
7.40.4.4.2.3	We now call it type I diabetes, and it is caused by a lack of the protein hormone insulin.
7.40.4.4.2.4	Glucose enters cells by diffusion, but cell membranes are not very permeable to glucose.
7.40.4.4.2.5	Glucose transporter proteins in cell membranes facilitate the movement of glucose into cells, and the glucose transporters called GLUT4 that are most common in muscle and adipose tissue are controlled by insulin.
7.40.4.4.2.6	When insulin binds to its receptor on the cell membrane, it causes these glucose transporters to move from cytoplasmic vesicles to the cell membrane, thus making the cell more permeable to glucose (Figure 40.14).
7.40.4.4.2.7	When insulin is not present, these transporters are returned to the cytoplasmic pool through endocytosis.
7.40.4.4.2.8	Figure 40.14 Glucose Transporters Are Controlled by Insulin
7.40.4.4.3.1	The other form of diabetes, which is seen in epidemic proportions in the United States today, is called adult onset or type II diabetes.
7.40.4.4.3.2	Type II diabetes is associated with obesity, high carbohydrate consumption, and lack of exercise.
7.40.4.4.3.3	It is caused either by low production of insulin or by insensitivity to insulin.
7.40.4.4.3.4	More than 90 percent of diabetes cases seen in the United States today are type II diabetes, and the numbers are rising alarmingly.
7.40.4.4.3.5	Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that the number of new cases of type II diabetes reported in the United States in 1991 was less than 600,000 and had been fairly stable since 1980.
7.40.4.4.3.6	Between 1991 and 2012, the annual number of new cases tripled.
7.40.4.4.3.7	Diabetes is currently the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, and it is a common contributor to blindness, kidney failure, stroke, heart disease, and amputations resulting from ulcerations.
7.40.4.4.3.8	This disease is largely preventable and even reversible with lifestyle changes.
7.40.4.4.4.1	In both type I and type II diabetes, glucose entry into cells is impaired, resulting in so much glucose accumulating in the blood that it starts to spill over into the urine.
7.40.4.4.4.2	A high concentration of glucose in the blood increases urine output by two mechanisms.
7.40.4.4.4.3	First, it causes water to move from cells into the blood by osmosis, and this increase in blood volume results in increased urine production.
7.40.4.4.4.4	Second, the increased glucose in the tubules of the kidneys pulls more water into the urine by osmosis.
7.40.4.4.4.5	Diabetic individuals thus lack metabolic fuel, and they can also become dehydrated.
7.40.4.4.4.6	Because glucose uptake by muscle and adipose tissue is impaired in the absence of insulin, muscle cells must depend on fat and protein for fuel and adipose tissue cannot replenish its stores of triglycerides.
7.40.4.4.4.7	If the condition is not treated, the body wastes away.
7.40.4.4.5.1	For centuries, the prospects for people suffering with type I diabetes were bleak.
7.40.4.4.5.2	A change came almost overnight in 1921, when the physician Frederick Banting and a medical student, Charles Best, at the University of Toronto, discovered they could reduce the symptoms of diabetes by injecting an extract prepared from pancreatic tissue.
7.40.4.4.5.3	The active component of this extract was found to be insulin, a small protein consisting of just 51 amino acids.
7.40.4.4.5.4	In the United States today, insulin replacement therapy using manufactured insulin allows more than 1.5 million people with type I diabetes to lead almost normal lives.
7.40.4.4.6.1	Much evidence now shows that type II diabetes can be treated with a combination of dietary changes and weight loss, and Figure 40.15 looks at the intriguing question of whether the hormone irisin (introduced in the opening of this chapter) can mediate the beneficial effects of exercise on glucose metabolism in type II diabetes patients.

7.40.4.4.10.1	Exercise has been shown to have benefits for individuals with type II diabetes and for obese individuals.
7.40.4.4.10.2	Imaging studies have revealed an inverse correlation between brown fat abundance and body mass&#8212;lean people have more brown fat and obese people have less.
7.40.4.4.10.3	Given that irisin has been shown to have a &#8220;browning&#8221; effect on white fat, making it more metabolically active, might irisin mediate the beneficial effects of exercise on glucose metabolism and body mass?
7.40.4.4.11.1	HYPOTHESIS Irisin can mediate exercise-induced improvements in glucose metabolism.
7.40.4.4.12.1	METHOD
7.40.4.4.13.1	For 2 weeks, treat mice with daily injections of irisin (experimentals) to simulate effects of exercise.
7.40.4.4.13.2	Treat control mice with injections of saline.
7.40.4.4.14.1	After 2 weeks, sacrifice mice and collect fat tissues to analyze for expression of genes for uncoupling protein (UCP1, an indication of irisin&#8217;s &#8220;browning&#8221; effect) and betatrophin (&#946;t, a peptide that stimulates proliferation of insulin-secreting cells in the pancreas).

7.40.4.4.24.1	Figure 40.15A showed that elevated irisin levels could stimulate pancreatic function in ways that could benefit individuals with type II diabetes.
7.40.4.4.24.2	Betatrophin had been shown to stimulate proliferation of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, increase release of insulin, and improve the ability of individuals to process glucose from dietary sources.
7.40.4.4.24.3	The question then arose whether these health benefits associated with betatrophin could be stimulated by irisin treatment.
7.40.4.4.24.4	Additional experiments were done to investigate this question.
7.40.4.4.24.5	Researchers kept mice on a high-fat diet for 10 weeks and then treated half of the mice with daily injections of irisin for 2 weeks while the other half received daily saline injections (control).

7.40.4.4.25.1	QUESTIONS
7.40.4.4.26.1	In the first experiment, why was it important to measure a known marker of brown fat function, namely UCP1, in the same experiment in which the expression of a new candidate gene, namely &#946;t was being measured as a response to irisin treatment?
7.40.4.4.27.1	In the second experiment, why were the mice first placed on a high-fat diet?
7.40.4.4.28.1	Type II diabetes is frequently associated with obesity and is characterized by insulin resistance.
7.40.4.4.28.2	As a result, insulin levels can be high while glucose metabolism is still impaired.
7.40.4.4.28.3	What evidence was produced supporting the hypothesis that raised irisin levels could benefit obese individuals or individuals with type II diabetes?
7.40.4.4.29.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.40.4.4.1.1.1	Insulin is produced in clusters of endocrine cells in the pancreas.
7.40.4.4.1.1.2	These clusters are called islets of Langerhans after the German medical student who discovered them.
7.40.4.4.1.1.3	They contain three types of cells, each of which produces a specific hormone:
7.40.4.4.1.2.1	Beta (&#946;) cells produce and secrete insulin.
7.40.4.4.1.3.1	Alpha (&#945;) cells produce and secrete glucagon, a hormone that has effects mostly opposite from those of insulin.
7.40.4.4.1.4.1	Delta (&#948;) cells produce the hormone somatostatin.
7.40.4.4.1.5.1	The rest of the pancreas is made up of exocrine tissue, which produces enzymes and other secretions that travel through ducts to the gut, where they participate in digestion.
7.40.4.4.1.6.1	After a meal, the concentration of glucose in the blood rises, stimulating the &#946; cells of the islets to release insulin.
7.40.4.4.1.6.2	Insulin causes target cells throughout the body to use circulating glucose as fuel and convert it into storage products such as glycogen and fat.
7.40.4.4.1.6.3	When the gut is empty of food, blood glucose concentration falls and the islets stop releasing insulin.
7.40.4.4.1.6.4	As a result, most cells shift to using glycogen and fat rather than glucose as fuel.
7.40.4.4.1.6.5	If blood glucose concentration falls substantially below normal, the islet &#945; cells release glucagon, which stimulates the liver to break down stored glycogen and release glucose into the blood.
7.40.4.4.1.6.6	We will discuss these actions in greater detail in Key Concept 50.4.
7.40.4.4.2.1.1	Somatostatin is released from the &#948; cells of the pancreas in response to rapid increases of glucose and amino acids in the blood.
7.40.4.4.2.1.2	This hormone has paracrine functions within the islets, where it inhibits the release of both insulin and glucagon.
7.40.4.4.2.1.3	Outside the pancreas it acts as a hormone, slowing the digestive activities of the gut and extending the period during which nutrients are absorbed.
7.40.4.4.2.1.4	Somatostatin is also produced in very small amounts by cells in the hypothalamus.
7.40.4.4.2.1.5	Hypothalamic somatostatin, also called growth hormone inhibiting hormone (GHIH), is transported in the portal blood vessels to the anterior pituitary, where it inhibits the release of growth hormone and thyrotropin.
7.40.4.5.1.1	An adrenal gland sits above each kidney, just below the middle of your back.
7.40.4.5.1.2	Functionally and anatomically, each adrenal gland consists of a gland within a gland (Figure 40.16).
7.40.4.5.1.3	The core, or adrenal medulla, produces epinephrine and, to a lesser degree, norepinephrine.
7.40.4.5.1.4	The medulla develops from nervous tissue and is under the control of the nervous system.
7.40.4.5.1.5	Surrounding the medulla is the adrenal cortex, which produces steroid hormones.
7.40.4.5.1.6	The cortex is under hormonal control, largely by a tropic hormone produced by cells in the anterior pituitary.
7.40.4.5.1.7	Figure 40.16 The Adrenal Is Really Two Glands
7.40.4.5.1.1.1	The cells of the adrenal cortex use cholesterol to produce three classes of steroid hormones (see Figure 40.2B), collectively called corticosteroids:
7.40.4.5.1.2.1	Mineralocorticoids influence the salt and water balance of the extracellular fluid.
7.40.4.5.1.3.1	Glucocorticoids influence blood glucose concentrations as well as other aspects of fat, protein, and carbohydrate metabolism.
7.40.4.5.1.4.1	Sex steroids play roles in sexual development, sexual behavior, and anabolism (tissue building).
7.40.4.5.1.5.1	In adult humans, the adrenal cortex secretes only negligible amounts of sex steroids.
7.40.4.5.1.5.2	The major producers of sex steroids are the gonads, as we saw in Key Concept 40.3.
7.40.4.5.1.6.1	Aldosterone, the primary mineralocorticoid, stimulates the kidneys to conserve sodium and excrete potassium, as we will discuss in Chapter 51.
7.40.4.5.1.6.2	If the adrenal glands are removed from an animal, sodium must be added to its diet, or its sodium will be depleted and it will die.
7.40.4.5.1.7.1	The main glucocorticoid in humans is cortisol, which is critical for mediating the body&#8217;s metabolic responses to stress.
7.40.4.5.1.7.2	Within minutes of a stressful stimulus (one provoking fear or anger, for example), blood cortisol levels begin to rise.
7.40.4.5.1.7.3	This response is much slower than the neurally mediated epinephrine and norepinephrine response to stress, but it lasts longer.
7.40.4.5.1.7.4	Whereas epinephrine and norepinephrine cause sudden increases in blood pressure, cortisol causes a sustained increase in blood pressure.
7.40.4.5.1.7.5	Cortisol stimulates tissues that are not critical for escaping the danger or threat to switch from using blood glucose for energy to using fats and proteins.
7.40.4.5.1.7.6	This action preserves circulating glucose to fuel the actions of the nervous system and skeletal muscles necessary to meet the threat.
7.40.4.5.1.7.7	Cortisol also raises blood pressure, to increase delivery of oxygen to the muscles to prepare them for flight or fight, and inhibits the immune system.
7.40.4.5.1.7.8	Dealing with the immediate stressor is more important than feeling sick, having allergic reactions, or healing wounds.
7.40.4.5.1.7.9	This explains why cortisol and drugs that mimic its action are useful for reducing inflammation and allergic responses.
7.40.4.5.1.7.10	Cortisol decreases activity of the gut and reproductive systems&#8212;you can digest lunch and reproduce later if you escape the threat.
7.40.4.5.1.7.11	You can see that actions of cortisol are adaptive in responding to acute stress, but they can cause problems if sustained over time, as sometimes occurs in modern society due to social, economic, and job-related stressors.
7.40.4.5.1.8.1	Cortisol release is controlled by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary.
7.40.4.5.1.8.2	ACTH release is controlled in turn by corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from the hypothalamus (see Figure 40.7) .
7.40.4.5.1.8.3	The action of ACTH on the adrenal cortex is to stimulate the synthesis of cortisol.
7.40.4.5.1.8.4	Like other steroid hormones, cortisol is not stored in vesicles and therefore is available for immediate release.
7.40.4.5.1.8.5	As cortisol or other steroid hormones diffuse into the blood, they combine with carrier proteins, and their release from these proteins can have a long time course, thus stretching out their actions.
7.40.4.5.1.8.6	Also, many of their actions stimulate gene expression in target cells, which also takes time but has a long-lasting effect.
7.40.4.5.1.9.1	Turning off the stress responses activated by cortisol is as important as turning them on.
7.40.4.5.1.9.2	A study of stress in rats showed that old rats could turn on these stress responses as effectively as young rats, but they had lost the ability to turn them off as rapidly.
7.40.4.5.1.9.3	As a result, they suffered from the well-known consequences of stress seen in humans: digestive system problems, cardiovascular problems, strokes, impaired immune system function, and increased susceptibility to cancers and other diseases.
7.40.4.5.1.9.4	Acute stress responses are turned off by negative feedback from cortisol on both the ACTH-secreting cells of the anterior pituitary and the CRH-secreting cells of the hypothalamus.
7.40.4.5.1.9.5	With chronic or prolonged stress, these control mechanisms become insufficient and cortisol must exert negative feedback through another brain region, the hippocampus.
7.40.4.5.1.9.6	Prolonged exposure to cortisol, however, causes trauma to and loss of hippocampal cells, resulting in the decreased ability to turn off the stress response.
7.40.4.5.1.10.1	Loss of adrenal cortical function results in Addison&#8217;s disease, which is characterized by fatigue, muscle weakness, digestive problems, low blood sodium (hyponatremia), low blood pressure, and salt hunger.
7.40.4.5.1.10.2	Without replacement hormone treatment, death is likely.
7.40.4.5.1.10.3	An interesting symptom of Addison&#8217;s disease is darkening of many skin areas that normally are not exposed to the sun&#8212;for instance, the lining of the cheeks.
7.40.4.5.1.10.4	You can understand the cause of this symptom by thinking about the source of ACTH and the control of its secretion.
7.40.4.5.1.10.5	In the hypothalamic&#8211;pituitary&#8211;endocrine gland axis (see Figure 40.7), an end hormone (in this case cortisol) frequently serves as a negative feedback signal to the pituitary and also the hypothalamus.
7.40.4.5.1.10.6	If the hormones of the adrenal cortex are absent, the negative feedback is also gone, and the system will call for more ACTH.
7.40.4.5.1.10.7	The production of ACTH by pituitary cells involves the expression of a polypeptide called proopiomelanocortin which is then cleaved to produce multiple peptide hormones.
7.40.4.5.1.10.8	These include ACTH, MSH, endorphins, and enkephalins.
7.40.4.5.1.10.9	The excess production of MSH is the cause of the skin darkening in Addison&#8217;s disease.
7.40.4.5.2.1.1	Stress causes the adrenal medulla to release epinephrine and norepinephrine that arouse the body to action.
7.40.4.5.2.1.2	As we saw earlier in this chapter, epinephrine and norepinephrine increase heart rate and blood pressure and divert blood flow to active muscles and away from the gut and skin.
7.40.4.5.2.1.3	Only about one-fifth as much norepinephrine is secreted from the adrenal medulla as epinephrine, but it has similar functions.
7.40.4.5.2.1.4	Norepinephrine is also used by the nervous system as a neurotransmitter, and it is involved in controlling many physiological processes.
7.40.4.5.2.2.1	Epinephrine and norepinephrine are both water-soluble, and both bind to the same set of receptors on the surfaces of target cells.
7.40.4.5.2.2.2	These adrenergic receptors are of two general types, &#945;-adrenergic and &#946;-adrenergic.
7.40.4.5.2.2.3	The &#945;-adrenergic receptors respond more strongly to norepinephrine than to epinephrine, whereas &#946;-adrenergic receptors respond about equally to both epinephrine and norepinephrine.
7.40.4.5.2.2.4	Because of this difference in receptor affinities, it is possible for drugs to blunt the flight-or-fight responses without disrupting physiological regulatory processes.
7.40.4.5.2.2.5	Such drugs are called &#8220;beta blockers&#8221; because, by inhibiting &#946;-adrenergic receptors, they can reduce the fight-or-flight response to epinephrine without disrupting the physiological regulatory functions of norepinephrine mediated through the &#945;-adrenergic receptors.
7.40.4.5.2.2.6	Beta blockers are commonly prescribed to reduce symptoms of anxiety such as dry mouth and elevated heart rate (palpitations).
7.40.4.6.1.1	We have discussed the major mammalian endocrine glands and their hormones in this chapter, but many more hormones exist.
7.40.4.6.1.2	As we discuss the organ systems of the body in the chapters that follow, we will frequently describe hormones that their tissues produce as well as hormones that control their functions.
7.40.4.7.1.1	Humans like most vertebrate species have a pineal gland located between the cerebral hemispheres.
7.40.4.7.1.2	The pineal has a daily rhythm of production and secretion of the hormone melatonin.
7.40.4.7.1.3	The functions of the pineal and melatonin have to do with coordinating daily rhythms of physiological functions and, in many species, seasonal changes such as reproduction timing, migration, and preparations for environmental stress such as cold weather.
7.40.4.7.2.1	40.4 recap
7.40.4.7.3.1	The major endocrine glands of mammals include the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, parathyroid glands, pancreas, adrenal glands, gonads, and pineal gland.
7.40.4.7.3.2	Each of these glands secretes and responds to hormones that play crucial roles in controlling physiology and development.
7.40.4.7.3.3	Thyroxine is a lipid-soluble hormone that influences the expression of genes involved in regulating cell metabolism.
7.40.4.7.3.4	Calcitonin and parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulate blood calcium levels, mainly by regulating the remodeling of bone.
7.40.4.7.3.5	Blood glucose levels are controlled by insulin when blood glucose levels rise and largely by the lack of insulin when blood glucose levels fall.
7.40.4.7.3.6	Glucagon is released in the event of serious hypoglycemia, and it stimulates breakdown of glycogen to raise blood glucose levels.
7.40.4.7.3.7	The adrenal cortex produces steroid hormones, the most important of which is cortisol, which is involved in stress responses.
7.40.4.7.3.8	The adrenal medulla produces epinephrine and norepinephrine.

7.40.4.7.15.1	In what ways could irisin mediate the health benefits of exercise?
7.40.4.7.16.1	The initial discovery of irisin and its functions revealed that it induces brown fat&#8211;like changes in white fat, including expression of the gene that codes for uncoupling protein (UCP1), which enables brown fat cells to metabolize lipids without producing ATP.
7.40.4.7.16.2	As a result, metabolism in the brown fat cells is not inhibited by the buildup of ATP or the lack of ADP, and the brown fat can simply metabolize excess energy and generate heat.
7.40.4.7.17.1	Exercise does more than promote weight loss and toned muscles.
7.40.4.7.17.2	It also improves cognition and glucose metabolism.
7.40.4.7.17.3	Improving glucose metabolism can help reverse the changes associated with type II diabetes&#8212;elevated blood glucose, elevated blood insulin, loss of sensitivity of the pancreas to glucose, and loss of sensitivity of body tissues to insulin.
7.40.4.7.17.4	Investigating Life: How Could Irisin Mediate the Benefits of Exercise on Cognition? and Figure 40.15 present experiments showing that irisin is a mediator of benefits of exercise on cognition and glucose metabolism.
7.40.4.7.17.5	It seems likely that irisin is a major integrating factor in a large suite of healthful benefits of exercise.
7.40.4.7.18.1	Future directions
7.40.4.7.19.1	The experiments explored in Investigating Life: How Could Irisin Mediate the Benefits of Exercise on Cognition? and Figure 40.15 suggest the interesting possibility that irisin could be developed as a therapeutic that might be useful in treating the national epidemic of obesity and type II diabetes.
7.40.4.7.19.2	It might also prove to be beneficial in cognitive declines due to conditions such as stroke and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.
7.40.4.7.19.3	Before such treatments can be developed, however, research is needed on such questions as: Are there potential negative side effects of abnormal elevations of irisin?
7.40.4.7.19.4	Is there the potential for abuse of irisin, similar to what has been seen with other growth-promoting agents such as growth hormone and testosterone?
7.40.4.7.19.5	It would seem that the safest way to benefit from the actions of irisin would be to use the natural approach of regular exercise to promote its normal production and release.

7.40.summary.11.3	Review Figure 40.6, Focus: Key Figure 40.7
7.40.summary.12.1	The posterior pituitary secretes two neurohormones: antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin.
7.40.summary.12.2	The anterior pituitary secretes tropic hormones (thyrotropin, adrenocorticotropin, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone) as well as growth hormone, prolactin, endorphins, enkephalins, and melanocyte stimulating hormone.
7.40.summary.13.1	The anterior pituitary is controlled by neurohormones produced by cells in the hypothalamus and transported through portal blood vessels to the anterior pituitary.

7.40.summary.23.4	Review Figure 40.16
7.40.summary.24.1	Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid that stimulates the kidneys to conserve sodium and excrete potassium.

7.40.summary.33.2	The iris is composed of two arrangements of smooth muscle fibers.
7.40.summary.33.3	Constrictor muscles surrounding the pupil are arranged in concentric circles, like tree rings.
7.40.summary.33.4	Peripheral to the constrictor fibers are the dilator fibers, which are arranged like the spokes on a bicycle wheel.
7.40.summary.33.5	When the constrictor muscles contract, the pupil becomes very small, and when the dilators contract, the pupil becomes large.
7.40.summary.34.1	Aging and exposure to UV light can cause the lens of the eye to become cloudy and nontransparent&#8212;a condition known as a cataract.
7.40.summary.34.2	To restore sight, a surgeon must remove the cataract through the pupil.
7.40.summary.34.3	To facilitate this surgery it is important to dilate the pupil as much as possible and to keep it dilated as long as possible.
7.40.summary.34.4	Pupillary dilation is facilitated by the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal medulla releasing epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine.

7.41.1.2	Using vaccines continues to be important in protecting an army as it is exposed to pathogens in the environment.
7.41.2.1	Key Concepts:
7.41.3.1	Animals Use Innate and Adaptive Mechanisms for Defense
7.41.4.1	Innate Defenses Are Nonspecific

7.41.9.1	investigatinglife
7.41.10.1	Vaccines and Immunity
7.41.11.1	Five tiny vials in deep freezers, three in Bethesda, Maryland, one in Atlanta, Georgia, and one in Siberia, are all that is left of the smallpox virus.
7.41.11.2	Smallpox killed more than 300 million people in the twentieth century, but the disease made its last appearance in 1978, thanks to vaccination.
7.41.11.3	A vaccine is usually an inactive form of a pathogen or toxin that provokes the immune system to produce antibodies: specific proteins directed against the target.
7.41.11.4	The immune system destroys whatever is bound to the antibodies.
7.41.12.1	The eradication of smallpox was a spectacular international accomplishment.
7.41.12.2	So why hasn&#8217;t vaccination for other potentially lethal diseases such as the flu (influenza) been widely accepted by the public?
7.41.12.3	More than one-third of Americans refuse flu shots, and a significant number of parents refuse vaccination for their children.
7.41.13.1	Unfortunately, those who refuse vaccination may harm people other than themselves.
7.41.13.2	A vaccination program can control or eradicate a disease only if a high percentage (typically above 80 percent) of people are vaccinated, thus disrupting the chain of infection from person to person.
7.41.13.3	A very high level of vaccination results in &#8220;herd immunity,&#8221; a state in which even those who cannot be vaccinated or who have weak immune systems are protected from infection.
7.41.13.4	This protection is lost if the vaccination rate falls below the level needed for herd immunity.
7.41.13.5	Those who are old or sick, and infants whose immune systems have not yet fully developed, are most at risk.
7.41.14.1	The best way to develop herd immunity in a population is compulsory vaccination.
7.41.14.2	In many countries, vaccination is a prerequisite for school enrollment and military enlistment and is required during epidemics.
7.41.14.3	For example, during the periodic smallpox epidemics during the twentieth century in the United States, doctors accompanied by police would go into neighborhoods where the disease raged, vaccinating all those who were uninfected and removing infected people to quarantine.
7.41.14.4	You can imagine the reaction of parents whose children were taken away, often to die.
7.41.14.5	Henning Jacobson was arrested when he refused vaccination during a smallpox epidemic.
7.41.14.6	He took his case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in 1905 that while personal freedom is important, each state is entitled to protect its citizens.
7.41.14.7	This provided a legal framework for compulsory vaccination that continues to this day.
7.41.14.8	But opposition and court challenges continue.
7.41.15.1	What are the mechanisms and implications of long-lasting immunity?
7.41.16.1	Chapter 41 continues with
7.41.17.1	41.1 Animals Use Innate and Adaptive Mechanisms for Defense
7.41.1.1.1	Innate defenses evolved before adaptive defenses
7.41.1.2.1	Mammals have both innate and adaptive defenses
7.41.1.3.1	Blood and lymph tissues play important roles in defense
7.41.1.4.1	White blood cells play many defensive roles
7.41.1.5.1	Immune system proteins bind pathogens or signal other cells
7.41.1.6.1	Animals have several ways of defending themselves against pathogens&#8212;harmful organisms and viruses that can cause disease.
7.41.1.6.2	These defense systems are based on the distinction between self&#8212;the animal&#8217;s own molecules&#8212;and nonself, or foreign, molecules.
7.41.1.7.1	focus your learning
7.41.1.8.1	The two general types of defense mechanisms are innate defenses and adaptive defenses.
7.41.1.9.1	Many animal groups have Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that participate in innate defense responses.
7.41.1.10.1	All white blood cells originate from multipotent stem cells in the bone marrow.
7.41.1.11.1	In mammals, the major immune system proteins include antibodies, MHC proteins, T cell receptors, and cytokines.
7.41.1.12.1	The defensive response involves three phases:
7.41.1.13.1	Recognition phase.
7.41.1.13.2	The organism must be able to discriminate between self and nonself.
7.41.1.14.1	Activation phase.
7.41.1.14.2	The recognition event leads to a mobilization of cells and molecules to fight the invader.
7.41.1.15.1	Effector phase.
7.41.1.15.2	The mobilized cells and molecules destroy the invader.
7.41.1.16.1	There are two general types of defense mechanisms:
7.41.1.17.1	Innate defenses, or nonspecific defenses, are inherited mechanisms that provide the first line of defense against pathogens.
7.41.1.17.2	Innate defenses typically act very rapidly and include barriers such as the skin, molecules that are toxic to invaders, and phagocytic cells that ingest invaders.
7.41.1.17.3	(Recall from Key Concept 6.5 that phagocytosis is a form of endocytosis, in which a cell engulfs a large particle or another cell. )
7.41.1.17.4	The innate immune system recognizes broad classes of organisms and molecules, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, protists, worms, and various toxins.
7.41.1.18.1	Adaptive defenses are aimed at specific pathogens and are activated by the innate immune system.
7.41.1.18.2	For example, the adaptive immune system can make an antibody protein that will recognize, bind to, and aid in the destruction of a specific pathogen, if that specific pathogen ever enters the body.
7.41.1.18.3	Adaptive defenses are typically slower to develop than the innate defenses and longer-lasting.
7.41.1.19.1	Immunity occurs when an organism has sufficient defenses to successfully avoid the effects of biological invasion by a pathogen.
7.41.1.1.1.1	All animals have innate defenses against their enemies.
7.41.1.1.1.2	For example, the arthropod Tachypleus tridentatus&#8212;the Japanese horseshoe crab&#8212;first appeared in the fossil record about 400 million years ago.
7.41.1.1.1.3	It relies only on innate defenses.
7.41.1.1.1.4	These defenses include barriers, defensive cells, and defensive molecules.
7.41.1.1.2.1	Barriers include physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms for resisting infections.
7.41.1.1.2.2	The horseshoe crab has the hard exoskeleton that is characteristic of arthropods.
7.41.1.1.2.3	This shell acts to protect the crab from invasion by pathogens.
7.41.1.1.3.1	Cells involved in innate defenses include phagocytes that bind to microbial pathogens, ingest them by endocytosis, and destroy them by hydrolysis.
7.41.1.1.3.2	Amebocytes in the blood of the horseshoe crab fufill this defensive role.
7.41.1.1.4.1	Molecules that are toxic to invading pathogens are important in innate defense.
7.41.1.1.4.2	The horseshoe crab has a wide array of such molecules that are released from cells in its blood.
7.41.1.1.4.3	These molecules include peptides that disrupt the bacterial cell membrane, rendering it permeable; and peptides that bind to bacterial surfaces and cross-link them.
7.41.1.1.5.1	Figure 41.1 Cell Signaling and Defense
7.41.1.1.6.1	Studies of innate immunity, along with genome sequencing, have revealed that the recognition and activation phases of innate immunity evolved very early in animals.
7.41.1.1.6.2	For example, animals as diverse as humans and fruit flies share a class of receptors, called Toll-like receptors (TLRs), that participate in innate defense responses.
7.41.1.1.6.3	These receptors recognize nonself molecules called * pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).
7.41.1.1.6.4	In vertebrates, each Toll-like receptor recognizes and binds to a specific molecule that is found in a broad class of pathogens, such as a component of the bacterial cell wall.
7.41.1.1.6.5	Binding triggers a signal transduction pathway that ends with the expression of genes for anti-pathogen molecules (Figure 41.1).
7.41.1.1.6.6	This pathway exists in some form in many animal groups, including humans.
7.41.1.1.7.1	* connect the concepts The recognition of PAMPs is widespread in immunity and is therefore an evolutionarily ancient mechanism.
7.41.1.1.7.2	Plants have an immune response to invading pathogens that also involves PAMPs.
7.41.1.1.7.3	See Key Concept 38.1.
7.41.1.2.1.1	Mammals have both kinds of defense mechanisms, and these mechanisms are the focus of this chapter.
7.41.1.2.1.2	In mammals, the innate and adaptive mechanisms operate together as a coordinated defense system.
7.41.1.2.1.3	Table 41.1 gives an overview of these defenses during the course of an infection.
7.41.1.2.1.4	Innate immunity is the body&#8217;s first line of defense because the adaptive defenses often require days or even weeks to become effective.
7.41.1.2.2.1	table 41.1 Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses to an Infection Response time System Mechanisms Early (0&#8211;4 hr) Innate, nonspecific (first line) Barrier (skin and lining of organs) Dryness, low pH Mucus Lysozyme, defensins Middle (&#62; 4&#8211;96 hr) Innate, nonspecific (second line) Inflammation Phagocytosis Natural killer cells Complement system Interferons Late (&#62; 96 hr) Adaptive, specific Humoral immunity (antibodies from B cells) Cellular immunity (T cells)
7.41.1.3.1.1	The components of the mammalian defense system are dispersed throughout the body and interact with almost all of its other tissues and organs.
7.41.1.3.1.2	The lymphoid tissues, which include the thymus, bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes, are essential parts of the defense system (Figure 41.2).
7.41.1.3.1.3	The blood and lymph are complex systems with nondefensive functions that will be discussed in Chapter 49.
7.41.1.3.1.4	They each have central roles in defense as well.
7.41.1.3.1.5	Figure 41.2 The Human Lymphatic System
7.41.1.3.2.1	The blood and lymph both consist of liquids in which cells are suspended:
7.41.1.3.3.1	Blood plasma is a yellowish solution containing ions, small molecule solutes, and soluble proteins.
7.41.1.3.3.2	Suspended in the plasma are red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (cell fragments essential to blood clotting).
7.41.1.3.3.3	Whereas red blood cells are normally confined to the closed circulatory system (the heart, arteries, capillaries, and veins), white blood cells and platelets are also found in the lymph.
7.41.1.3.4.1	Lymph is a fluid that is derived from the blood (but lacking red blood cells) and other tissues and accumulates in intercellular spaces throughout the body.
7.41.1.3.4.2	From these spaces, the lymph moves slowly into the vessels of the lymphatic system.
7.41.1.3.4.3	Tiny lymph capillaries conduct this fluid to larger ducts that eventually join together, forming two large vessels, the thoracic duct and right lymphatic duct, which join a major vein (the left subclavian vein) near the heart.
7.41.1.3.4.4	By this system of vessels, the lymph is eventually returned to the blood and the circulatory system.
7.41.1.3.5.1	At many sites along the lymph vessels are small, roundish structures called lymph nodes, which contain a type of white blood cell called a lymphocyte.
7.41.1.3.5.2	As lymph passes through a lymph node, the lymphocytes encounter foreign cells and molecules that have entered the body, and if they are recognized as nonself, an immune response is initiated.
7.41.1.4.1.1	One milliliter of human blood typically contains about 5 billion red blood cells and 7 million of the larger white blood cells (also called leukocytes).
7.41.1.4.1.2	All of these cells originate from multipotent stem cells (constantly dividing undifferentiated cells that can form several different cell types; see Key Concept 19.1) in the bone marrow.
7.41.1.4.1.3	There are two major families of white blood cells: lymphocytes and phagocytes (Figure 41.3).
7.41.1.4.1.4	Lymphocytes include the B cells and T cells; they are smaller than other white blood cells and are not phagocytic.
7.41.1.4.1.5	Phagocytes include most of the other cells shown in Figure 41.3, and as their name suggests, they are phagocytic.
7.41.1.4.1.6	Each kind of white blood cell has specialized functions.
7.41.1.4.1.7	Some phagocytes are also referred to collectively as granulocytes because they contain numerous granules (vesicles containing defensive molecules).
7.41.1.4.1.8	Defensive proteins and signals play fundamental roles in the interactions and functioning of these cells.
7.41.1.4.1.9	Figure 41.3 White Blood Cells
7.41.1.5.1.1	The cells that defend mammalian bodies work together, interacting with one another and with the cells of invading pathogens.
7.41.1.5.1.2	These cell&#8211;cell interactions are accomplished by a variety of key proteins, including receptors, other cell surface proteins, and signaling molecules.
7.41.1.5.1.3	Four of the major players are listed here, and will be discussed in more detail later in the chapter.
7.41.1.5.2.1	Antibodies are proteins that bind specifically to certain substances identified by the immune system as nonself.
7.41.1.5.2.2	The specific molecules that bind to antibodies are called antigens.
7.41.1.5.2.3	Antibodies are produced by B cells.
7.41.1.5.3.1	Major histocompatibility complex(MHC) proteins are used to display antigens on the surfaces of self cells, so that the antigens can be detected by the T cells of the immune system.
7.41.1.5.3.2	MHC proteins also function as important self-identifying labels.
7.41.1.5.4.1	T cell receptors are integral membrane proteins on the surfaces of T cells.
7.41.1.5.4.2	They recognize and bind to antigens presented by the MHC proteins on the surfaces of other cells.
7.41.1.5.5.1	Cytokines are soluble signaling proteins released by many cell types.
7.41.1.5.5.2	They bind to cell surface receptors and alter the behavior of their target cells.
7.41.1.5.6.1	41.1 recap
7.41.1.5.7.1	All animals have innate defenses against pathogens, and vertebrates have innate and adaptive defenses.
7.41.1.5.7.2	Both kinds of mechanisms are based on the ability to differentiate self from nonself.
7.41.1.5.7.3	Innate defenses target a broad range of molecules and organisms, whereas adaptive &#173;defenses target specific pathogens.
7.41.1.5.7.4	Both innate and adaptive defenses involve specialized white blood cells.
7.41.1.5.8.1	learning outcomes
7.41.1.5.9.1	You should be able to:
7.41.1.5.10.1	Compare various types of defense mechanisms.
7.41.1.5.11.1	Describe the role of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway in innate immunity.
7.41.1.5.12.1	Infer what types of immune-related molecules and genes a particular animal would have.
7.41.1.5.13.1	Describe three characteristics of innate immunity and adaptive immunity that distinguish them from each other.
7.41.1.5.14.1	Some people have a rare genetic disease that results in defective signaling in the TLR pathway.
7.41.1.5.14.2	What would be the phenotype of such individuals?
7.41.1.5.15.1	If you compared the genomes of an insect and a human with regard to the presence of genes involved in immunity, what might you find?
7.41.1.5.16.1	The outcome of an infectious disease&#8212;the life or death of the host&#8212;often depends on the success of both rapid, innate responses and long-lasting, adaptive responses to invading pathogens.
7.41.1.5.16.2	We will turn now to the innate defenses that protect vertebrates from disease.
7.41.1.5.17.1	Chapter 41 continues with
7.41.1.5.18.1	41.2 Innate Defenses Are Nonspecific
7.41.2.1.1	Specialized proteins and cells participate in innate immunity
7.41.2.2.1	Inflammation is a coordinated innate response to infection or injury
7.41.2.3.1	Innate defenses are general protection mechanisms that attempt to stop pathogens from invading the body or to quickly eliminate those that do manage to invade.
7.41.2.3.2	They are genetically programmed (innate) and &#8220;ready to go,&#8221; in contrast to adaptive responses, which take time to develop after a pathogen or toxin has been recognized as nonself.
7.41.2.4.1	focus your learning
7.41.2.5.1	Innate immunity is applied to any potential harmful invader.
7.41.2.6.1	Physical barriers, such as skin, are the first line of innate defense.
7.41.2.7.1	Inflammation involves recruitment of cells and defensive molecules to an area damaged by a pathogen or other injury.
7.41.2.8.1	Innate immunity is sometimes described as nonspecific immunity because it is applied indiscriminately to any potentially harmful invader.
7.41.2.8.2	There are two lines of innate defense (Figure 41.4).
7.41.2.8.3	The first line of innate defense is encountered by a potential pathogen as soon as it lands on the surface of an animal.
7.41.2.8.4	Consider a pathogenic bacterium that lands on human skin.
7.41.2.8.5	The challenges faced by the bacterium just to reach its target are formidable: Figure 41.4 Innate Immunity
7.41.2.9.1	The physical barrier of the skin: Bacteria rarely penetrate intact skin, which has about 30 cell layers; by the same token, broken skin increases the risk of infection.
7.41.2.10.1	The saltiness and dryness of skin: This environment may not be hospitable to the growth of the bacterium.
7.41.2.11.1	The presence of normal flora: Bacteria and fungi that normally live and sometimes reproduce in great numbers on our body surfaces without causing disease will compete with pathogens for space and nutrients.
7.41.2.12.1	If a pathogen lands inside the nose or another internal organ, it faces other innate defenses:
7.41.2.13.1	Mucus is a slippery secretion produced by mucous membranes found at the inner surfaces of the nose (as well as the digestive, respiratory, and urogenital systems).
7.41.2.13.2	Mucus traps microorganisms so they can be removed by the beating of cilia (see Figure 5.17), which continuously move the mucus and its trapped debris away.
7.41.2.14.1	Lysozyme is an enzyme made by cells of the mucous membranes that attacks the cell walls of many bacteria, causing them to lyse (burst open).
7.41.2.15.1	Defensins, also made by mucous membranes, are peptides of 18&#8211;45 amino acids that contain hydrophobic domains.
7.41.2.15.2	They are toxic to a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, microbial eukaryotes, and enveloped viruses.
7.41.2.15.3	Defensins insert themselves into the cell membranes of these organisms and make the membranes permeable, thus killing the invaders.
7.41.2.15.4	Defensins are also produced in phagocytes, where they kill pathogens ingested by phagocytosis.
7.41.2.15.5	Plants also produce *defensins in response to pathogen exposure.
7.41.2.16.1	* connect the concepts Key Concept 38.1 describes constitutive and cellular responses to pathogens in plants.
7.41.2.16.2	Among these are the pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, which are similar to defensins produced by animals.
7.41.2.16.3	These small peptides bind to fungal membranes and are toxic to a wide range of fungal targets, but they are not toxic to plant or animal cells.
7.41.2.16.4	Other PR proteins may serve as alarm signals to plant cells that have not yet been attacked.
7.41.2.17.1	Harsh conditions in an animal&#8217;s internal environment can also kill pathogens.
7.41.2.17.2	For example, gastric juice in the stomach is a deadly environment for many bacteria because of the hydrochloric acid and proteases that are secreted into it.
7.41.2.1.1.1	Several proteins are produced by the body either before an infection occurs or in response to invasion by pathogens.
7.41.2.1.1.2	Two important groups are the complement and interferon proteins.
7.41.2.1.1.1.1	Vertebrate blood contains more than 20 different proteins that make up the antimicrobial complement system.
7.41.2.1.1.1.2	This system can be activated by various mechanisms, including both innate and adaptive defense responses.
7.41.2.1.1.1.3	The proteins act in a characteristic sequence, or cascade, with each protein activating the next:
7.41.2.1.1.2.1	First, the proteins attach to specific components on the surface of a microbe or to an antibody that has already bound to the microbe&#8217;s surface.
7.41.2.1.1.2.2	In either case, binding helps phagocytes recognize and destroy the microbe.
7.41.2.1.1.3.1	Then, complement proteins activate the inflammatory response (see Figure 41.5) and attract phagocytes to the site of infection.
7.41.2.1.1.4.1	Finally, complement proteins lyse invading cells (such as bacteria).
7.41.2.1.2.1.1	When a cell is infected by a pathogen, it produces small amounts of signaling proteins called interferons that increase the resistance of neighboring cells to infection.
7.41.2.1.2.1.2	Interferons are a class of cytokines and have been found in many vertebrates.
7.41.2.1.2.1.3	Various molecules, including double-strand (viral) RNA, induce the production of interferons.
7.41.2.1.2.1.4	Thus interferons are particularly important as a defense against viruses.
7.41.2.1.2.1.5	Interferons bind to receptors on the cell membranes of uninfected cells, stimulating a signaling pathway that inhibits viral reproduction if the cells are subsequently infected.
7.41.2.1.2.1.6	In addition, interferons stimulate the cells to hydrolyze bacterial or viral proteins to peptides, an initial step in adaptive immunity (see Key Concept 41.3).
7.41.2.1.3.1.1	Some phagocytes travel freely in the circulatory and lymphatic systems; others can move out of blood vessels and adhere to certain tissues.
7.41.2.1.3.1.2	Pathogenic cells, viruses, or fragments of these invaders are recognized by phagocytes, which then ingest them by phagocytosis.
7.41.2.1.3.2.1	Defensins, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen intermediates inside these phagocytes then kill the pathogens.
7.41.2.1.4.1.1	One class of lymphocytes, known as natural killer cells, can distinguish virus-infected cells and some tumor cells from their normal counterparts and initiate apoptosis (programmed cell death) of these target cells.
7.41.2.1.4.1.2	In addition to this innate defense action, natural killer cells interact with the adaptive defense mechanisms by lysing antibody-labeled target cells.
7.41.2.1.5.1.1	These phagocytes occur in tissues exposed to the environment, such as skin and the linings of the digestive and respiratory tracts, as well as in blood.
7.41.2.1.5.1.2	They act as messengers between the innate and adaptive immune systems.
7.41.2.1.5.1.3	They can endocytose microbes, viruses, and even remmants of the virus-infected host cells.
7.41.2.1.5.1.4	Once inside a dendritic cell, these particles are digested to fragments, and the dendritic cell &#8220;presents&#8221; an antigenic fragment on its surface, along with class II MHC proteins (see Key Concept 41.5).
7.41.2.1.5.1.5	In addition, the dendritic cell secretes signals that activate cells of the adaptive immune system.
7.41.2.2.1.1	When mammalian tissue is damaged because of infection or injury, the body responds with inflammation.
7.41.2.2.1.2	This response can happen almost anywhere in the body, internally as well as on the surface.
7.41.2.2.1.3	Inflammation is an important phenomenon: it isolates the damaged area to stop the spread of the damage; it recruits cells and molecules to the damaged location to kill the invader; and it promotes healing.
7.41.2.2.1.4	The first responders to tissue damage are mast cells, which adhere to the skin and the linings of organs and release numerous chemical signals, including:
7.41.2.2.2.1	Tumor necrosis factor, a cytokine protein that kills target cells and activates immune cells.
7.41.2.2.3.1	Prostaglandins, fatty acid derivatives involved in various responses, including the widening of blood vessels.
7.41.2.2.3.2	Prostaglandins interact with nerve endings and are partly responsible for the pain caused by inflammation.
7.41.2.2.4.1	Histamine, an amino acid derivative that leads to the important process of dilation of blood vessels, as well as itchy, watery eyes and rashes seen with some types of allergic reactions.
7.41.2.2.5.1	The redness and heat of inflammation result from the dilation and leakiness of blood vessels in the infected or injured area (Figure 41.5).
7.41.2.2.5.2	Phagocytes enter the inflamed area, where they engulf the invaders and dead tissue cells.
7.41.2.2.5.3	Phagocytes are responsible for most of the healing associated with inflammation.
7.41.2.2.5.4	They produce several cytokines, which (among other functions) can signal the brain to produce a fever.
7.41.2.2.5.5	This rise in body temperature accelerates lymphocyte production and phagocytosis, thereby speeding the immune response.
7.41.2.2.5.6	In some cases, pathogens are temperature-sensitive and their growth is inhibited.
7.41.2.2.5.7	The pain of inflammation results from increased pressure due to swelling, the action of leaked enzymes on nerve endings, and the action of prostaglandins, which increase the sensitivity of the nerve endings to pain.
7.41.2.2.5.8	Figure 41.5 Interactions of Cells and Chemical Signals Result in Inflammation
7.41.2.2.6.1	Q: Antihistamines are a class of drugs widely used to treat people with inflammation.
7.41.2.2.6.2	How do you think they work?
7.41.2.2.7.1	Following inflammation, pus may accumulate.
7.41.2.2.7.2	Pus is a mixture of leaked fluid and dead cells: bacteria, neutrophils (the most abundant white blood cells&#8212;see Figure 41.3), and damaged body cells.
7.41.2.2.7.3	Pus is a normal result of inflammation and is gradually consumed and further digested by macrophages.
7.41.2.2.8.1	41.2 recap
7.41.2.2.9.1	Innate immunity is the first line of defense against pathogens.
7.41.2.2.9.2	Innate immunity includes physical barriers such as the skin, and cellular responses involving the recognition of self and nonself molecules.
7.41.2.2.9.3	Recognition of nonself molecules by white blood cells leads to coordinated responses such as the production of defensive proteins and inflammation.
7.41.2.2.10.1	learning outcomes
7.41.2.2.11.1	You should be able to:
7.41.2.2.12.1	Summarize the roles of physical barriers, chemical defenses, and cellular defenses in innate immunity.
7.41.2.2.13.1	Explain how the innate defense system defends against  a pathogen.
7.41.2.2.14.1	List the steps in the inflammatory response.
7.41.2.2.15.1	A pathogenic bacterium lands on your skin.
7.41.2.2.15.2	Outline the innate defenses that come into play.
7.41.2.2.16.1	Your immune system does not mount an innate defense response to a speck of dust that lands on your skin, but it may mount an innate response to a bacterium.
7.41.2.2.16.2	Why?
7.41.2.2.17.1	When a splinter of wood permeates the skin, the skin swells up.
7.41.2.2.17.2	Outline the events by which this occurs.
7.41.2.2.18.1	Often the innate immune system, with its nonspecific defenses, is adequate to prevent or fight off a pathogenic infection.
7.41.2.2.18.2	But in many cases this system works together with adaptive immunity, which detects and responds to specific pathogens.
7.41.2.2.18.3	We will now turn to the development and functioning of adaptive immunity.
7.41.2.2.19.1	Chapter 41 continues with
7.41.2.2.20.1	41.3 Adaptive Defenses Are Specific
7.41.3.1.1	What are the key features of adaptive immunity?
7.41.3.2.1	Macrophages and dendritic cells play a key role in activating the adaptive immune system
7.41.3.3.1	Two types of adaptive immune responses interact
7.41.3.4.1	Adaptive immunity develops as a result of clonal selection
7.41.3.5.1	Clonal deletion helps the immune system distinguish self from nonself
7.41.3.6.1	Immunological memory results in a secondary immune response
7.41.3.7.1	Vaccines are an application of immunological memory
7.41.3.8.1	More than a century ago, experiments showed that guinea pigs that were infected with bacteria that cause diphtheria produced a chemical in their blood that can protect other guinea pigs from infection.
7.41.3.8.2	This observation led to the concept of adaptive immunity and to the understanding that factors promoting immunity are found in blood.
7.41.3.9.1	focus your learning
7.41.3.10.1	The humoral and cellular immune responses work simultaneously and cooperatively.
7.41.3.11.1	Memory cells, the key to immunological memory, retain the capacity to divide to produce effector and more memory cells.
7.41.3.12.1	Vaccinations initiate a primary immune response, generating memory cells without causing illness.
7.41.3.13.1	In this section we outline the main features of the adaptive immune system.
7.41.3.13.2	We will consider the two major types of adaptive responses: the humoral immune response, which produces antibodies; and the cellular immune response, which destroys infected cells.
7.41.3.1.1.1	Four important features of the adaptive immune system are:
7.41.3.1.2.1	Specificity
7.41.3.1.3.1	The ability to distinguish self from nonself
7.41.3.1.4.1	The ability to respond to an enormous diversity of nonself molecules
7.41.3.1.5.1	Immunological memory
7.41.3.1.1.1.1	Lymphocytes (B and T cells) are crucial components of adaptive immunity.
7.41.3.1.1.1.2	T cell receptors and the antibodies produced by B cells recognize and bind to specific nonself substances (antigens), and this interaction initiates an adaptive immune response.
7.41.3.1.1.1.3	The specific sites on antigens that the immune system recognizes are called antigenic determinants, or epitopes:
7.41.3.1.1.2.1	An antigenic determinant is a specific portion of a large molecule, such as a certain sequence of amino acids that may be present in a protein.
7.41.3.1.1.2.2	Antigens are usually proteins or polysaccharides, and there can be multiple antigens on a single invading bacterium.
7.41.3.1.1.2.3	A single antigenic molecule can have multiple, different antigenic determinants.
7.41.3.1.1.2.4	The host animal responds to the presence of an antigen with highly specific defenses involving T cell receptors and antibodies.
7.41.3.1.1.2.5	These receptors and soluble proteins bind to the antigenic determinants.
7.41.3.1.1.2.6	Each T cell and each antibody is specific for a single antigenic determinant.
7.41.3.1.1.2.7	For the remainder of the chapter, we will refer to antigenic determinants simply as &#8220;antigens. &#8221;
7.41.3.1.2.1.1	You have seen how the innate immune system distinguishes between self and nonself molecules.
7.41.3.1.2.1.2	The adaptive immune system has another set of mechanisms for distinguishing self from nonself.
7.41.3.1.2.1.3	The human body contains tens of thousands of different molecules, each with a specific three-dimensional structure capable of generating immune responses.
7.41.3.1.2.1.4	Thus every cell in the body has a tremendous number of antigens.
7.41.3.1.2.1.5	A crucial requirement of an individual&#8217;s adaptive immune system is that it recognize the body&#8217;s own antigens and not attack them.
7.41.3.1.3.1.1	Challenges to the immune system are numerous.
7.41.3.1.3.1.2	Pathogens take many forms: viruses, bacteria, protists, fungi, and multicellular parasites.
7.41.3.1.3.1.3	Furthermore, each pathogenic species usually exists as many subtly different genetic strains, and each strain possesses multiple surface features.
7.41.3.1.3.1.4	Estimates vary, but a reasonable guess is that humans can respond specifically to 10 million different antigens.
7.41.3.1.3.1.5	Upon recognizing an antigen, the adaptive immune system responds by activating lymphocytes of the appropriate specificity.
7.41.3.1.4.1.1	After the adaptive immune system responds to a particular type of pathogen once, the adaptive immune system &#8220;remembers&#8221; that pathogen and can usually respond more rapidly and powerfully to the same threat in the future.
7.41.3.1.4.1.2	This immunological memory usually saves us from repeats of childhood diseases such as chicken pox.
7.41.3.1.4.2.1	All four of these features of adaptive immune defense characterize both the humoral immune response and the cellular immune response.
7.41.3.2.1.1	As you have seen, one way to eliminate pathogens with the innate immune system is phagocytosis.
7.41.3.2.1.2	After ingestion of a pathogenic organism or infected host cell, phagocytic cells display fragments of the pathogen on their cell surfaces.
7.41.3.2.1.3	These fragments function as antigens, and antigen presentation is one way that components of the innate immune system communicate with the adaptive immune system.
7.41.3.2.1.4	Macrophages and dendritic cells play a key role in activating the adaptive immune system.
7.41.3.2.1.5	After engulfing pathogens or infected host cells, these cells migrate to lymph nodes, where they present antigen to immature (previously unexposed) T cells.
7.41.3.2.1.6	In addition, the antigen-presenting cells secrete cytokines and other signals that stimulate the activation and differentiation of the T cells.
7.41.3.3.1.1	The adaptive immune system mounts two types of responses against invaders: the humoral immune response and the cellular immune response.
7.41.3.3.1.2	These two responses work simultaneously and cooperatively, sharing many mechanisms.
7.41.3.3.1.3	We will use the example of a viral infection in an overview of these two types of responses (Focus: Key Figure 41.6).
7.41.3.3.1.4	These responses also occur when bacteria or other pathogens infect and grow inside host cells.

7.41.3.3.4.1	Q: In AIDS, a virus infects TH cells and kills them.
7.41.3.3.4.2	What would be the effects on adaptive immunity?
7.41.3.3.5.1	B cells that make antibodies are the workhorses of the humoral immune response, and cytotoxic T (TC) cells are the workhorses of the cellular immune response.
7.41.3.3.5.2	There are three phases in both types of adaptive immune response:
7.41.3.3.6.1	Recognition phase: In both cellular and humoral immunity, recognition occurs when an antigen is inserted into the cell membrane of an antigen-presenting cell, with the unique antigen structure protruding from the cell membrane.
7.41.3.3.6.2	In addition to dendritic cells and macrophages, developing B cells can also perform phagocytosis and function as antigen-presenting cells.
7.41.3.3.6.3	A virus-infected host cell can be engulfed by an antigen-presenting cell, or the free viral particles may be engulfed.
7.41.3.3.6.4	The antigen on the surface of the antigen-presenting cell is recognized by a T-helper (TH) cell bearing a T cell receptor protein that is specific for the antigen.
7.41.3.3.6.5	In both humoral and cellular immunity, binding initiates the activation phase.
7.41.3.3.7.1	Activation phase: When the TH cell recognizes an antigen on an antigen-presenting cell, it propagates and releases cytokines that stimulate B cells and TC cells bearing receptors to the same antigen to divide.
7.41.3.3.7.2	The results are a clone of B cells that function in humoral immunity and a clone of TC cells that function in cellular immunity.
7.41.3.3.8.1	Effector phase: In the humoral immune response, cells of the B clone produce antibodies that bind to viral particles and/or virus-infected cells.
7.41.3.3.8.2	The bound antibodies attract phagocytes and complement proteins that engulf and destroy the virus and the virus-infected cells.
7.41.3.3.8.3	In cellular immunity, cells of the TC clone bind to virus-infected cells and destroy them.
7.41.3.4.1.1	Before the humoral and cellular immune responses can take place, the body needs to generate a vast diversity of lymphocytes that have the ability to bind different antigens.
7.41.3.4.1.2	How does this tremendous diversity arise?
7.41.3.4.1.3	As we will discuss in Key Concept 41.4, this diversity is generated primarily by DNA changes&#8212;chromosomal rearrangements and other mutations&#8212;that occur just after the B and T cells are formed in the bone marrow.
7.41.3.4.1.4	Millions of different B cells develop, each of which can produce only one kind of antibody.
7.41.3.4.1.5	Similarly, there are millions of different T cells, each with one specific kind of T cell receptor.
7.41.3.4.1.6	Thus the adaptive immune system is &#8220;predeveloped&#8221;&#8212;all ofthe machinery available to respond to an immense diversity of antigens is already there, even before the antigens are ever encountered.
7.41.3.4.2.1	As we have described, when a pathogen enters the vertebrate body it stimulates the innate immune system.
7.41.3.4.2.2	In addition to triggering its own defensive responses, the innate immune system triggers adaptive defensive responses via specific antigens that are presented on the surfaces of antigen-presenting cells, particularly dendritic cells.
7.41.3.4.2.3	This triggers the proliferation of lymphocytes (B and T cells) that are specific for those particular antigens.
7.41.3.4.2.4	How does this proliferation occur?
7.41.3.4.2.5	The answer lies in the process of clonal selection: antigen binding &#8220;selects&#8221; a particular B or T cell for proliferation.
7.41.3.4.2.6	When an antigen fits the surface receptor on a B or T cell and binds to it, that cell is activated.
7.41.3.4.2.7	It divides to form a clone of cells (a genetically identical group derived from a single cell), all of which recognize and react to the same antigen.
7.41.3.4.2.8	This process is illustrated for B cells in Figure 41.7.
7.41.3.4.2.9	Binding and activation select a particular lymphocyte, while proliferation generates the clone, hence the term &#8220;clonal selection. &#8221;
7.41.3.4.3.1	Figure 41.7 Clonal Selection in B Cells
7.41.3.4.4.1	Q: You may never have been exposed to Ebola virus.
7.41.3.4.4.2	Do you have cells that make antibodies against this virus?
7.41.3.4.4.3	Explain.
7.41.3.5.1.1	Normally the body is tolerant of its own molecules.
7.41.3.5.1.2	One way that the immune system does this is through the process of clonal deletion.
7.41.3.5.1.3	This occurs during the early differentiation of T and B cells, when these cells encounter self antigens.
7.41.3.5.1.4	Any immature B or T cell that shows the potential to mount an immune response against self antigens undergoes apoptosis within a short time.
7.41.3.6.1.1	The first time a vertebrate animal is exposed to a particular antigen there is a time lag (usually several days) before the B cell&#8211;produced antibody molecules and T cells specific to that antigen slowly increase.
7.41.3.6.1.2	But for years afterward&#8212;sometimes for life&#8212;the immune system &#8220;remembers&#8221; that particular antigen, allowing the body to mount a faster response the next time it encounters the antigen.
7.41.3.6.1.3	How does this happen?
7.41.3.6.2.1	The answer lies in the fact that activated lymphocytes divide and differentiate to produce two types of daughter cells: effector cells and memory cells.
7.41.3.6.3.1	Effector cells carry out the attack on the antigen.
7.41.3.6.3.2	Effector B cells, called plasma cells, secrete antibodies.
7.41.3.6.3.3	Effector T cells release cytokines and other molecules that initiate reactions that destroy nonself or altered cells.
7.41.3.6.3.4	Effector cells live only a few days.
7.41.3.6.4.1	Memory cells (see Figure 41.7) are long-lived cells that retain the ability to start dividing on short notice to produce more effector and more memory cells.
7.41.3.6.4.2	Memory B and T cells may survive in the body for decades, rarely dividing.
7.41.3.6.5.1	Effector cells and memory cells can respond to an antigen in two different ways:
7.41.3.6.6.1	When the body first encounters a particular antigen, a primary immune response is activated, in which the previously unexposed lymphocytes that recognize that antigen proliferate to produce clones of effector and memory cells.
7.41.3.6.7.1	After a primary immune response to a particular antigen, subsequent encounters with the same antigen will trigger a much more rapid and powerful secondary immune response.
7.41.3.6.7.2	The memory cells that bind with that antigen proliferate, launching a huge army of plasma cells and effector T cells.
7.41.3.7.1.1	Thanks to immunological memory, exposure to many diseases (including childhood diseases such as chicken pox) provides a natural immunity to those diseases.
7.41.3.7.1.2	Furthermore, it is possible to provide artificial immunity against many life-threatening diseases by vaccination: the introduction of antigen into the body in a form that does not cause disease.
7.41.3.7.2.1	Vaccination initiates a primary immune response, generating memory cells without making the person ill.
7.41.3.7.2.2	Later, if a pathogen carrying the same antigen attacks, specific memory cells already exist.
7.41.3.7.2.3	They recognize the antigen and quickly overwhelm the invaders with a massive production of lymphocytes and antibodies.
7.41.3.7.3.1	Because of mutation, an antigenic determinant on a pathogen can change over time.
7.41.3.7.3.2	If the change is significant in terms of three-dimensional structure, a vaccine directed against an antigen from a pathogen may become ineffective.
7.41.3.7.3.3	You are familiar with this with regard to influenza.
7.41.3.7.3.4	More often than not, the annual flu season features a genetic strain of the flu virus that is not sufficiently related to the previous season&#8217;s vaccine; so a new vaccine, with new B cell clones, must be made.
7.41.3.7.3.5	A remarkable recent finding is that memory cells can last a long time and help in a response to new, related antigens.
7.41.3.7.3.6	People who were exposed to a particular strain of flu retain antibody-making memory cells against that strain for decades and develop a rapid immune response to a new, genetically different strain that appears years later.
7.41.3.7.3.7	In the case of flu, the memory cells are making antibodies that bind to not just the first strain of flu they responded to, but to later ones as well.
7.41.3.7.3.8	Characterizing these antibodies provides a clue to developing a vaccine that is broadly effective and obviates the need to develop new ones (Investigating Life: What Are the Mechanisms and Implications of Long-Lasting Immunity?).

7.41.3.7.8.1	The Framingham Heart Study was begun in 1948 with the objective of finding out the causes of heart disease and stroke.
7.41.3.7.8.2	About 5,000 people ages 30&#8211;62 and living in the town Framingham, Massachusetts, have been subjected every 2 years to extensive medical exams in an attempt to relate lifestyle factors to heart disease.
7.41.3.7.8.3	Subsequent generations have been added to the study ever since.
7.41.3.7.8.4	Not only has this study led to major findings about the causes of heart disease, but it has provided a wealth of data on other medical conditions as well.
7.41.3.7.8.5	Peter Palese of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City measured antibodies in blood to flu virus strains from 40 people in the Framingham study, born between 1917 and 1952.
7.41.3.7.8.6	They had been exposed to major flu outbreaks in 1957, 1968, and 1977, as well as to the typical flu that comes up every year.
7.41.3.7.8.7	Blood samples were examined between 1987 and 2008 to see if these people still had antibodies against the three major flu outbreak strains, and whether these antibody amounts increased over time as people fought off the new, less virulent strains that arise every year.
7.41.3.7.9.1	HYPOTHESIS Exposure to new strains of flu stimulates antibody production against strains to which an individual was exposed previously.
7.41.3.7.10.1	CONCLUSION People exposed to flu virus develop long-lasting memory cells that make antibodies that have broad specificity to other flu strains.

7.41.3.7.14.1	work with the data
7.41.3.7.15.1	QUESTIONS Figure A
7.41.3.7.16.1	Blood samples were taken from 1987 to 2008, and the people&#8217;s reactivity against various flu strains was tested.
7.41.3.7.16.2	The results for antibodies against the Russian flu strain of 1977 in numerous individuals are shown in Figure A. Note that these people were exposed to many flu strains after 1977.
7.41.3.7.16.3	The data shown are typical for the way specific immune reactions are measured.
7.41.3.7.16.4	The titer is presented as a reciprocal.
7.41.3.7.16.5	For example, a titer of 2 means that undiluted serum sample gave an antibody reaction (titer 1), and so did a dilution of 1 part serum and 1 part water (dilution of 1/2, reciprocal = 2).
7.41.3.7.16.6	If the sample was diluted to a titer of 4 (1 part serum, 3 parts water), there was no reaction because the concentration of antibody was too low.
7.41.3.7.16.7	The higher the titer number, the more the blood serum could be diluted to still react with the antigen; that is, a higher titer number means that there were more antibodies in the original serum sample.
7.41.3.7.16.8	What can you conclude about the titer of anti-Russian flu strain over the years 1987&#8211;2008?
7.41.3.7.16.9	Figure B
7.41.3.7.17.1	The flu virus mutates rapidly.
7.41.3.7.17.2	In contrast, another virus to which people are exposed, cytomegalovirus (CMV), does not mutate rapidly.
7.41.3.7.17.3	Antibody titer against CMV were measured, and the data are shown in Figure B. What can you conclude from these data?
7.41.3.7.17.4	Compare the antibody response to CMV over time with that against the Russian flu virus strain and comment.
7.41.3.7.17.5	Figure C
7.41.3.7.18.1	A protein on the surface of the flu virus called hemagluttinin (HA) is exposed to the immune system because of its prominent location (Figure C).
7.41.3.7.18.2	When the flu virus genes mutate, the &#8220;head&#8221; of the protein tends to accumulate more changes than the stalk.
7.41.3.7.18.3	Thus the amino acid sequences of stalk regions of various flu strains are similar.
7.41.3.7.18.4	The investigators measured antibodies to the stalk region that were either broadly reactive to various flu strains, or not broadly reactive.
7.41.3.7.18.5	The results are shown in the table.
7.41.3.7.18.6	What can you conclude about the broadly reactive antibodies?
7.41.3.7.18.7	How does this provide a guide for the development of a broadly based flu vaccine?

7.41.3.7.21.1	41.3 recap
7.41.3.7.22.1	The adaptive immune system reacts against nonself molecules called antigens.
7.41.3.7.22.2	The system generates amazing diversity in both antibodies (produced by B cells) and in T cell receptors.
7.41.3.7.22.3	In the primary immune response, B cells and T cells that recognize a particular antigen proliferate by clonal selection.
7.41.3.7.22.4	Immunological memory prepares the body for a much stronger secondary immune response.

7.41.3.7.29.2	People who had been alive at the time of the 1918 epidemic had low rates of infection.
7.41.3.7.29.3	Explain this in terms of immunological memory.
7.41.3.7.30.1	How do vaccines make use of immunological memory?
7.41.3.7.31.1	The general features of the adaptive system are that it is pre-made to respond specifically to virtually any antigen, and it involves an initial primary response to the antigen and a more powerful secondary response when the same antigen is encountered in the future.
7.41.3.7.31.2	As we noted, the adaptive system has a humoral response with B cells making antibodies and a cellular response with T cells expressing specific receptors.
7.41.3.7.31.3	We now turn to these two types of adaptive response, beginning with the humoral system.
7.41.3.7.32.1	Chapter 41 continues with
7.41.3.7.33.1	41.4 The Humoral Adaptive Response Involves Antibodies
7.41.4.1.1	Antibody protein structure reflects function
7.41.4.2.1	There are five classes of immunoglobulins
7.41.4.3.1	Immunoglobulin diversity results from DNA rearrangements and other mutations
7.41.4.4.1	The constant region is involved in immunoglobulin class switching
7.41.4.5.1	Every day in the human body, billions of B cells survive the test of clonal deletion and are released from the bone marrow into the circulatory system.
7.41.4.5.2	B cells are the basis for the humoral immune response.
7.41.4.6.1	focus your learning
7.41.4.7.1	Antibody proteins are immunoglobulins with four polypeptide chains&#8212;two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains, each with constant and variable regions.
7.41.4.8.1	IgG is the most common of the five classes of immunoglobulins.
7.41.4.9.1	DNA rearrangements and other mutations generate the diversity of immunoglobulins.
7.41.4.10.1	A B cell begins as an unexposed B cell with a receptor protein on its cell surface that is specific for a particular antigen.
7.41.4.10.2	The cell is activated by antigen binding to this receptor, and after stimulation by a TH cell, it gives rise to a clone of plasma cells that make antibodies as well as to a smaller number of memory cells (see Figure 41.7).
7.41.4.10.3	The stimulation occurs after the B cell presents antigen to a TH cell with a receptor that can recognize the antigen.
7.41.4.10.4	The TH cell then secretes cytokines that stimulate the B cell to divide.
7.41.4.11.1	Activated plasma cells (effector B cells) can synthesize and secrete large amounts of antibody proteins&#8212;up to 2,000 molecules per second!
7.41.4.11.2	All the plasma cells arising from a given B cell produce antibodies that are specific for the antigen that originally bound to the parent B cell.
7.41.4.11.3	Thus antibody specificity is maintained as B cells proliferate.
7.41.4.1.1.1	Antibodies belong to a class of proteins called immuno-globulins.
7.41.4.1.1.2	There are several types of immunoglobulins, but all contain a tetramer consisting of four polypeptide chains: two &#8220;heavy chains&#8221; and two &#8220;light chains&#8221; (Figure 41.8).
7.41.4.1.1.3	In each immunoglobulin molecule, the two light chains are identical, and the two heavy chains are identical.
7.41.4.1.1.4	Disulfide bonds hold the chains together, characteristically in a Y-like shape.
7.41.4.1.1.5	Figure 41.8 The Structure of an Immunoglobulin
7.41.4.1.2.1	Each of the four polypeptide chains has a constant region and a variable region (designated C and V in Figure 41.8A):
7.41.4.1.3.1	The amino acid sequences of the constant regions are similar among the immunoglobulins.
7.41.4.1.3.2	They determine the destination and function&#8212;the class&#8212;of each immunoglobulin.
7.41.4.1.4.1	The amino acid sequences of the variable regions are different for each specific immunoglobulin.
7.41.4.1.4.2	Their three-dimensional antigen-binding sites are determined by their secondary structures and are responsible for antibody specificity.
7.41.4.1.5.1	Antigen&#8211;antibody binding is noncovalent.
7.41.4.1.5.2	The attractive forces involved in holding antigen and antibody together include hydrogen bonding, ionic attractions, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces (see Key Concept 2.2).
7.41.4.1.5.3	These attractive forces are generated from particular amino acids at the binding site on both molecules.
7.41.4.1.5.4	So for an antibody protein, the sequence of amino acids at the binding site is crucial to its specificity.
7.41.4.1.5.5	Generating antibody diversity is thus a molecular genetics challenge, as we will soon discuss.
7.41.4.1.6.1	The two antigen-binding sites on each immunoglobulin molecule are identical, making the antibody bivalent (bi, &#8220;two,&#8221; + valent, &#8220;binding&#8221;), meaning the molecule can bind two antigen molecules at once.
7.41.4.1.6.2	Bivalency, in addition to the presence of multiple epitopes on the surfaces of many antigens (including large proteins, viruses, and bacteria, as you saw in the case of the influenza virus explored in Investigating Life: What Are the Mechanisms and Implications of Long-Lasting Immunity?), permits antibodies to form large complexes with the antigens.
7.41.4.1.6.3	These complexes are easy targets for ingestion and breakdown by phagocytes.
7.41.4.2.1.1	While the variable regions are responsible for the specificity of an immunoglobulin, the constant regions of the heavy chain determine the class of the immunoglobulin.
7.41.4.2.1.2	The five immunoglobulin classes are described in Table 41.2.
7.41.4.2.1.3	The most abundant class is IgG; these soluble antibody proteins make up about 80 percent of the total immunoglobulin content of the bloodstream.
7.41.4.2.1.4	They are made in greatest quantity during a secondary immune response.
7.41.4.2.1.5	IgG molecules defend the body in several ways.
7.41.4.2.1.6	For example, after some IgG molecules bind to antigens, they become attached by their heavy chains to macrophages.
7.41.4.2.1.7	This attachment permits the macrophages to destroy the antigens by phagocytosis.
7.41.4.2.2.1	table 41.2 Antibody Classes Class General structure Location Function IgG Monomer Free in blood plasma; about 80 percent of circulating antibodies Most abundant antibody in primary and secondary immune responses; crosses placenta and provides passive immunization to fetus IgM Pentamer Surface of B cell; free in blood plasma Antigen receptor on B cell membrane; first class of antibodies released by B cells during primary response IgD Monomer Surface of B cell Cell surface receptor of mature B cell; important in B cell activation IgA Dimer Saliva, tears, milk, and other body secretions Protects mucosal surfaces; prevents attachment of pathogens to epithelial cells IgE Monomer Secreted by plasma cells in skin and tissues lining gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts Binds to mast cells and basophils to sensitize them to subsequent binding of antigen, which triggers release of histamine that contributes to inflammation and some allergic responses
7.41.4.3.1.1	Each mature B cell makes antibodies targeted to only one single antigen.
7.41.4.3.1.2	And there are millions of possible antigens to which a human can be exposed.
7.41.4.3.1.3	How can the genome encode enough different antibodies to protect the body against all the possible pathogens?
7.41.4.3.1.4	Although there are millions of possible amino acid sequences in immunoglobulins, there are not millions of different immunoglobulin genes.
7.41.4.3.1.5	It turns out that instead of a single gene encoding each complete immunoglobulin, the genome of the differentiating B cell has multiple different coding regions for each domain of the protein, and diversity is generated by putting together different combinations of these regions.
7.41.4.3.1.6	Shuffling of this genetic deck generates the enormous immunological diversity that characterizes each individual mammal.
7.41.4.3.2.1	Each gene encoding an immunoglobulin chain is in reality a &#8220;supergene&#8221; assembled by means of genetic recombination from several clusters of smaller genes scattered along part of a chromosome (Figure 41.9).
7.41.4.3.2.2	Every cell in the body has hundreds of immunoglobulin genes located in separate clusters that are potentially capable of participating in the synthesis of both the variable and constant regions of immunoglobulin chains.
7.41.4.3.2.3	In most body cells and tissues, these genes remain intact and separated from one another.
7.41.4.3.2.4	But during B cell development, these genes are cut out, rearranged, and joined together in DNA recombination events.
7.41.4.3.2.5	One gene from each cluster is chosen randomly for joining, and the others are deleted.
7.41.4.3.2.6	In the case of one multigene set, the J genes, some of the extra sequences are removed by RNA splicing (Figure 41.10).
7.41.4.3.2.7	Figure 41.9 Supergene Figure 41.10 Heavy-Chain Gene Recombinationand RNA Splicing
7.41.4.3.3.1	In this manner, a unique immunoglobulin supergene is assembled from randomly selected &#8220;parts. &#8221; Each B cell precursor assembles two supergenes, one for a specific heavy chain and the other, assembled independently, for a specific light chain.
7.41.4.3.3.2	This remarkable example of irreversible cell differentiation generates an enormous diversity of immunoglobulins from the same genome.
7.41.4.3.3.3	It is a major exception to the generalization that all somatic cells derived from the fertilized egg have identical DNA.
7.41.4.3.4.1	Figure 41.9 illustrates the gene families that encode the constant and variable regions of the heavy chain in mice.
7.41.4.3.4.2	Multiple genes encode each of the three parts of the variable region: 100 V, 30 D, and 6 J genes.
7.41.4.3.4.3	Each B cell randomly selects one gene from each of these clusters to make the final coding sequence (VDJ) of the heavy-chain variable region.
7.41.4.3.4.4	So the number of different heavy chains that can be made through this random recombination process is quite large:
7.41.4.3.5.1	100 V    30 D    6 J = 18,000 possible combinations
7.41.4.3.6.1	Now consider that the light chains are similarly constructed, with a similar amount of diversity made possible by random recombination.
7.41.4.3.6.2	If we assume that the degree of potential light-chain diversity is the same as that for heavy-chain diversity, the number of possible combinations of light- and heavy-chain variable regions is:
7.41.4.3.7.1	18,000 different light chains    18,000 different heavy chains = 324 million possibilities!
7.41.4.3.8.1	Other mechanisms generate even more diversity:
7.41.4.3.9.1	When the DNA sequences that encode the V, D, and J regions are rearranged so that they are next to one another, the recombination event is not precise, and errors occur at the junctions.
7.41.4.3.9.2	This imprecise recombination can create * frame-shift mutations, generating new codons at the junctions, with resulting amino acid changes.
7.41.4.3.10.1	After the DNA sequences are cut and before they are rejoined, the enzyme terminal transferase often adds some nucleotides to the free ends of the DNA pieces.
7.41.4.3.10.2	These additional bases create insertion mutations.
7.41.4.3.11.1	There is a relatively high spontaneous mutation rate in immunoglobulin genes.
7.41.4.3.11.2	Once again, this process creates many new alleles and adds to antibody diversity.
7.41.4.3.12.1	* connect the concepts When they occur in the coding regions of proteins, point mutations can cause silent, missense, nonsense, or frame-shift mutations (see Figure 15.2).
7.41.4.3.12.2	Key Concept 17.2 discusses how some sequences of DNA can move within a genome.
7.41.4.3.13.1	When we include these possibilities with the millions of combinations that can be made by random DNA rearrangements, it is not surprising that the immune system can mount a response to almost any natural or artificial substance.
7.41.4.3.14.1	Once the DNA rearrangements are completed, each supergene is transcribed and then translated to produce an immunoglobulin light chain or heavy chain.
7.41.4.3.14.2	These chains combine to form an active immunoglobulin protein.
7.41.4.4.1.1	Table 41.2 describes the different classes of immunoglobulins and their functions.
7.41.4.4.1.2	Generally, a B cell makes only one class at a time.
7.41.4.4.1.3	But class switching can occur, in which a B cell changes the immunoglobulin class it synthesizes.
7.41.4.4.1.4	For example, a B cell making IgM can switch to making IgG.
7.41.4.4.2.1	Early in its life, a B cell produces IgM molecules, which are the receptors responsible for its recognition of a specific antigen.
7.41.4.4.2.2	At this time, the constant region of the heavy chain is encoded by the first constant region gene, the &#924; gene (see Figures 41.9 and 41.10).
7.41.4.4.2.3	If the B cell later becomes a plasma cell during a humoral immune response, another deletion occurs in the cell&#8217;s DNA, positioning the variable region genes (consisting of the same V, D, and J genes) next to a constant region gene farther away on the original DNA molecule.
7.41.4.4.2.4	Such a DNA deletion results in the production of a new immunoglobulin with a different constant region of the heavy chain, and therefore a different function (see Table 41.2).
7.41.4.4.2.5	However, this immunoglobulin has the same variable regions&#8212;and therefore the same antigen specificity&#8212;as the IgM produced by the parent B cell.
7.41.4.4.2.6	The new immunoglobulin protein falls into one of the other four classes (IgA, IgD, IgE, or IgG), depending on which of the constant region genes is placed adjacent to the variable region genes.
7.41.4.4.3.1	41.4 recap
7.41.4.4.4.1	The humoral immune response is based on the synthesis by B cells of specific immunoglobulins.
7.41.4.4.4.2	The specificity of an immunoglobulin derives from the amino acid sequence of its variable regions.
7.41.4.4.4.3	B cells can make millions of immunoglobulins with different specificities by rearranging the genes that encode the variable regions of the heavy and light chains.
7.41.4.4.5.1	learning outcomes
7.41.4.4.6.1	You should be able to:
7.41.4.4.7.1	Compare the antigen-binding site of an antibody with other molecules such as enzymes that bind other molecules.

7.41.4.4.12.3	For all of the immunoglobulins?
7.41.4.4.12.4	Explain your answer.
7.41.4.4.13.1	By making antibodies, B cells are the major players in the humoral immune response.
7.41.4.4.13.2	We will now turn to the cellular immune response, and the T cells responsible for it.
7.41.4.4.14.1	Chapter 41 continues with
7.41.4.4.15.1	41.5 The Cellular Adaptive Response Involves T Cells and Receptors
7.41.5.1.1	MHC proteins present antigen to T cells, causing recognition
7.41.5.2.1	T-helper cells and MHC II proteins contribute to the humoral immune response
7.41.5.3.1	Cytotoxic T cells and MHC I proteins contribute to the cellular immune response
7.41.5.4.1	Regulatory T cells suppress the humoral and cellular immune responses
7.41.5.5.1	Two types of effector T cells (T-helper cells and cytotoxic T cells) are involved in the cellular immune response.
7.41.5.5.2	They work along with proteins of the major histocompatibility complex (the MHC proteins), which present antigens on the surfaces of cells and contribute to the immune system&#8217;s tolerance for the body&#8217;s own cells.
7.41.5.6.1	focus your learning
7.41.5.7.1	In the effector phase of the humoral response, T-helper (TH) cells activate previously unexposed B cells with the same specificity to produce antibodies.
7.41.5.8.1	Regulatory T cells (Tregs), which recognize self antigens, help ensure that the immune system does not attack self cells and molecules indiscriminately.
7.41.5.9.1	Two classes of effector T cells (cytotoxic T cells and T-helper cells) are involved in the cellular adaptive response.
7.41.5.10.1	Diversity in MHC molecules is very high in humans.
7.41.5.11.1	Like B cells, T cells possess specific membrane receptors.
7.41.5.11.2	The T cell receptor is not an immunoglobulin, but a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of about half that of an IgG.
7.41.5.11.3	It is made up of two polypeptide chains, each encoded by a separate gene (Figure 41.11).
7.41.5.11.4	The two chains have distinct regions with constant and variable amino acid sequences.
7.41.5.11.5	As in the immunoglobulins, the variable regions provide the site for specific binding to antigens.
7.41.5.11.6	But there is one major difference: whereas an antibody can bind to an antigen whether it is present on the surface of a cell or not, a T cell receptor binds only to an antigen displayed by an MHC protein on the surface of an antigen-presenting or target cell.
7.41.5.11.7	Figure 41.11 A T Cell Receptor
7.41.5.12.1	When a T cell is activated by contact with a specific antigen, it proliferates and forms a clone.
7.41.5.12.2	Its descendants form clones of two types of effector T cells:
7.41.5.13.1	Cytotoxic T cells, or TC cells, recognize virus-infected or mutated cells and kill them by inducing lysis.
7.41.5.14.1	T-helper cells (TH cells, also called helper T cells) assist both the cellular and the humoral immune responses.
7.41.5.1.1.1	Both TH and TC cells express T cell receptors that bind to antigen on the cell surface.
7.41.5.1.1.2	But the response of each cell type to binding is quite different.
7.41.5.1.1.3	TH binding results in activation of the adaptive immune response, whereas TC binding results in death of the cell carrying the antigen.
7.41.5.1.1.4	MHC proteins form complexes with antigens on cell surfaces and assist with recognition by the T cells, so that the appropriate type of T cell binds.
7.41.5.1.2.1	The MHC proteins are cell membrane glycoproteins.
7.41.5.1.2.2	Two types of MHC proteins function to present antigens to the two different types of T lymphocytes:
7.41.5.1.3.1	Class I MHC proteins are present on the surface of every nucleated cell in the mammalian body.
7.41.5.1.3.2	They present antigens to TC cells.
7.41.5.1.3.3	These antigens can be fragments of virus proteins in virus-infected cells or abnormal proteins made by cancer cells as a result of somatic mutations.
7.41.5.1.3.4	A TC cell with the appropriate T cell receptor binds to the MHC-antigen complex.
7.41.5.1.3.5	To ensure binding, the TC cell also has a cell surface receptor protein called CD8 that recognizes and binds to MHC I.
7.41.5.1.4.1	Class II MHC proteins are on the surfaces of macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells.
7.41.5.1.4.2	They present antigens to TH cells.
7.41.5.1.4.3	The three cell types ingest antigens and break them down; one of the fragments then binds to MHC II for presentation (Figure 41.12).
7.41.5.1.4.4	A TH cell with the appropriate T cell receptor binds to the MHC-antigen complex.
7.41.5.1.4.5	To ensure binding, the TH cell also has a cell surface receptor protein called CD4 that recognizes and binds to MHC II.
7.41.5.1.4.6	Figure 41.12
7.41.5.1.5.1	In humans there are three genetic loci for class I MHC proteins and three for class II MHC proteins.
7.41.5.1.5.2	Each of these six loci has as many as 100 different alleles.
7.41.5.1.5.3	With so many possible allele combinations, it is not surprising that different people are very likely to have different MHC genotypes.
7.41.5.1.5.4	This is why it can be difficult to find a good &#8220;match&#8221; for organ donations.
7.41.5.1.5.5	MHC proteins are &#8220;self&#8221; markers.
7.41.5.1.5.6	To accomplish its role in antigen presentation, an MHC protein has an antigen-binding site that can hold a peptide of about 10&#8211;20 amino acids.
7.41.5.1.6.1	Information on MHC proteins, the cellular origins of antigens, and T lymphocytes is summarized in Table 41.3.
7.41.5.1.7.1	table 41.3 The Interaction between T Cells and Antigen-Presenting Cells Presenting cell type Antigen presented MHC class T cell type T cell surface protein Any cell Intracellular protein fragment Class I Cytotoxic T cell (TC) CD8 Macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells Fragments from extracellular proteins Class II Helper T cell (TH) CD4
7.41.5.2.1.1	When a TH cell survives the selection processes and binds to an antigen-presenting cell, it releases cytokines that activate the TH cell to proliferate, producing a clone of TH cells with the same specificity.
7.41.5.2.1.2	The steps to this point constitute the activation phase of the humoral immune response, and they occur in the lymphoid tissues.
7.41.5.2.1.3	Next comes the effector phase, in which the TH cells activate previously unexposed B cells with the same specificity to produce antibodies.
7.41.5.2.2.1	B cells are also antigen-presenting cells.
7.41.5.2.2.2	B cells take up antigens bound to their surface immunoglobulin receptors by endocytosis, break them down, and display antigenic fragments on class II MHC proteins.
7.41.5.2.2.3	When a TH cell binds to the displayed antigen&#8211;MHC II complex, it releases cytokines that cause the B cell to produce a clone of plasma cells and memory cells (Figure 41.13A).
7.41.5.2.2.4	Finally, the plasma cells secrete antibodies, completing the effector phase of the humoral immune response.
7.41.5.2.2.5	Figure 41.13 Phases of the Humoral and Cellular Immune Responses
7.41.5.3.1.1	Class I MHC proteins play a role in the cellular immune response that is similar to the role played by class II MHC proteins in the humoral immune response.
7.41.5.3.1.2	In a virus-infected or mutated cell, foreign or abnormal proteins or peptide fragments combine with class I MHC molecules.
7.41.5.3.1.3	The resulting complex is displayed on the cell surface and presented to TC cells.
7.41.5.3.1.4	When a TC cell recognizes and binds to this antigen&#8211;MHC I complex, it is activated to proliferate (Figure 41.13B).
7.41.5.3.2.1	In the effector phase of the cellular immune response, TC cells recognize and bind to cells bearing the same antigen&#8211;MHC I complex.
7.41.5.3.2.2	These bound TC cells produce a substance called perforin, which ultimately results in apoptosis of the bound target cell.
7.41.5.3.2.3	In addition, the TC cells can bind to a specific receptor (called Fas) on the target cell that initiates apoptosis in that cell.
7.41.5.3.2.4	These two mechanisms work in concert to eliminate the antigen-containing host cell.
7.41.5.3.2.5	Because TC cells recognize MHC proteins complexed with nonself antigens, they help rid the body of its own virus-infected or cancer cells.
7.41.5.4.1.1	Figure 41.14 Tregs and Tolerance
7.41.5.4.2.1	A third class of T cells called regulatory T cells (Tregs) ensures that the immune system does not attack self cells and molecules indiscriminately.
7.41.5.4.2.2	Like TH and TC cells, Tregs mature in the thymus gland, carry T cell receptors, and become activated if they bind to antigen&#8211;MHC complexes.
7.41.5.4.2.3	But Tregs are different in one important way: the antigens that Tregs recognize are self antigens.
7.41.5.4.2.4	The activation of Tregs causes them to secrete cytokines, which blocks the activation of T cells that are bound to the same antigen-presenting cell (Figure 41.14).
7.41.5.4.2.5	Thus Tregs constitute another mechanism for distinguishing self from nonself.
7.41.5.4.3.1	41.5 recap
7.41.5.4.4.1	The cellular immune response acts against virus-infected or mutated body cells.
7.41.5.4.4.2	Specific receptors on T cells bind to antigen&#8211;MHC complexes displayed on cell surfaces.
7.41.5.4.4.3	During development, T cells are selected that recognize MHC proteins.
7.41.5.4.4.4	T-helper cells bind antigens on MHC II proteins and contribute to the humoral immune response.
7.41.5.4.4.5	Cytotoxic T cells bind antigens on MHC I proteins and contribute to the cellular immune response.
7.41.5.4.4.6	Tregs suppress immune responses to self antigens.
7.41.5.4.5.1	learning outcomes
7.41.5.4.6.1	You should be able to:
7.41.5.4.7.1	Summarize the role of MHC proteins in the humoral immune response.
7.41.5.4.8.1	Provide reasonable speculation regarding how drugs could generate immunosupression by targeting T-helper cells, and predict the side effects of these drugs.
7.41.5.4.9.1	Describe how Tregs suppress the cellular and humoral immune systems.
7.41.5.4.10.1	Predict consequences of inappropriate levels of activity of Tregs.
7.41.5.4.11.1	MHC proteins almost always differ among unrelated people, so organ transplants usually provoke a cellular immune response by the host, causing rejection.
7.41.5.4.11.2	People receiving transplants are given a drug called cyclosporine which inhibits T cell development.
7.41.5.4.11.3	How do you think cyclosporine works?
7.41.5.4.12.1	When a virus infects a cell, the immune system mounts an adaptive response to this infection.
7.41.5.4.12.2	What are the roles of the T cell receptor and MHC protein in this response?
7.41.5.4.13.1	Cancer cells often express proteins that the body has never seen, so they are targeted by the cellular adaptive immune system.
7.41.5.4.13.2	In some cancers, however, Tregs are increased in numbers and activity.
7.41.5.4.13.3	Why would this indicate a poor prognosis?
7.41.5.4.14.1	Given the numerous and complex cellular interactions that activate the immune system and generate antibody diversity, you may have perceived many points at which the immune system could fail.
7.41.5.4.14.2	We will now turn to several situations in which one or more components of this complex system malfunction.
7.41.5.4.15.1	Chapter 41 continues with
7.41.5.4.16.1	41.6 Malfunctions in Immunity Can Be Harmful
7.41.6.1.1	The immune system mounts an excessive response in allergic reactions
7.41.6.2.1	Autoimmune diseases are caused by reactions against self antigens
7.41.6.3.1	AIDS is an immune deficiency disorder
7.41.6.4.1	Sometimes the immune system overreacts, as in an allergic response.
7.41.6.4.2	Sometimes it attacks self antigens, as in autoimmune disease.
7.41.6.4.3	And sometimes it fails to act, or acts weakly, as in immune deficiency disease.
7.41.6.5.1	focus your learning
7.41.6.6.1	Allergic reactions, which can be immediate or delayed, result from an over-stimulation of the immune response.
7.41.6.7.1	Allergies can be treated by desensitization.
7.41.6.8.1	Autoimmunity occurs when T cells bind to antigen&#8211;MHC complexes that carry self antigens.
7.41.6.9.1	The study of HIV has led to the development of treatments for HIV.
7.41.6.1.1.1	An allergic reaction arises when the human immune system overreacts to (is hypersensitive to) a dose of antigen.
7.41.6.1.1.2	Although the antigen itself may present no danger to the host, the inappropriate immune response may produce inflammation and other symptoms, which can cause serious illness or even death.
7.41.6.1.1.3	Allergic reactions are the most familiar examples of this phenomenon.
7.41.6.1.1.4	Allergic reactions may involve immediate hypersensitivity or delayed hypersensitivity.
7.41.6.1.1.1.1	Immediate hypersensitivity arises when an allergic individual is exposed to an antigen (in this case referred to as an allergen) from the environment, such as a food, pollen, or the venom of an insect.
7.41.6.1.1.1.2	In response to the allergen, the individual makes large amounts of IgE.
7.41.6.1.1.1.3	When this happens, mast cells in tissues and basophils in the blood bind the constant end of the IgE.
7.41.6.1.1.1.4	If that individual is exposed to the same allergen again, binding of the allergen to the IgE causes the mast cells and basophils to rapidly release a large amount of histamine (Figure 41.15).
7.41.6.1.1.1.5	This results in symptoms such as dilation of blood vessels, inflammation, and difficulty breathing.
7.41.6.1.1.1.6	If not treated with antihistamines, a severe allergic reaction can lead to death.
7.41.6.1.1.1.7	It is not known why some people produce excessive amounts of IgE in response to allergens.
7.41.6.1.1.1.8	There is some evidence for genetic factors predisposing people to allergic responses.
7.41.6.1.1.1.9	Figure 41.15 An Allergic Reaction
7.41.6.1.1.2.1	Allergy to pollen can be treated using a process called desensitization.
7.41.6.1.1.2.2	The process involves injecting small amounts of the allergen (typically just an extract of the offending plant tissue) into the skin&#8212;enough to stimulate IgG production but not enough to stimulate IgE production.
7.41.6.1.1.2.3	The next time the person is exposed to the allergen, IgG binds to it, tying it up before IgE can bind it and exert its harmful effects.
7.41.6.1.1.3.1	Desensitization does not work well for food allergens because the IgE response to those substances is so strong that even a small amount of antigen provokes it.
7.41.6.1.1.3.2	The best approach for those with food allergies is to avoid foods containing the allergens.
7.41.6.1.1.3.3	This can be difficult, but food labels listing all the ingredients are helpful.
7.41.6.1.1.3.4	Molecular biologists are beginning to identify the antigens that act as allergens, with the hope of developing vaccines or genetically modified foods that lack the allergenic epitopes.
7.41.6.1.2.1.1	Delayed hypersensitivity is an allergic reaction that does not begin until hours after exposure to an antigen.
7.41.6.1.2.1.2	In this case the antigen is taken up by antigen-presenting cells, and a T cell response is initiated.
7.41.6.1.2.1.3	A TH cell produces a clone of cells that secrete various cytokines, which cause such reactions as inflammation and rash.
7.41.6.1.2.1.4	These events take time (hence the term &#8220;delayed&#8221;).
7.41.6.1.2.1.5	An example is the rash that develops after exposure to poison ivy.
7.41.6.2.1.1	Errors in the selection of T cells in the thymus can result in T cells that bind to antigen&#8211;MHC complexes that carry self antigens.
7.41.6.2.1.2	Although the precise origin of autoimmunity is not known, there are several hypotheses:
7.41.6.2.2.1	Failure of negative selection.
7.41.6.2.2.2	A clone of lymphocytes making antibodies against self antigens that should have been destroyed by clonal deletion is not destroyed.
7.41.6.2.3.1	Molecular mimicry.
7.41.6.2.3.2	T cells that recognize a nonself antigen, such as a virus, also recognize something on a self antigen that has a similar structure.
7.41.6.2.4.1	Autoimmunity does not always result in disease, but several autoimmune diseases are common:
7.41.6.2.5.1	People with systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) have antibodies to many cellular components, including DNA and nuclear proteins released from dying cells.
7.41.6.2.5.2	These antinuclear antibodies can cause serious damage when they bind to normal tissue antigens and form large circulating antigen&#8211;antibody complexes, which become stuck in tissues and provoke inflammation.
7.41.6.2.6.1	People with rheumatoid arthritis have difficulty in shutting down a T cell response to self antigens.
7.41.6.2.6.2	These patients may have low activity of CTLA4, an inhibitory protein that blocks T cells from reacting to self antigens.
7.41.6.2.6.3	This results in inflammation of the joints and other tissue damage.
7.41.6.2.7.1	Hashimoto&#8217;s thyroiditis is the most common autoimmune disease in women over 50.
7.41.6.2.7.2	Immune cells attack thyroid tissue, resulting in fatigue, depression, weight gain, and other symptoms.
7.41.6.2.8.1	Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, or type I diabetes, occurs most often in children.
7.41.6.2.8.2	It is caused by an immune reaction against several proteins in the cells of the pancreas that manufacture the protein hormone insulin.
7.41.6.2.8.3	This reaction kills the insulin-producing cells, so people with type I diabetes must take insulin daily in order to survive.
7.41.6.3.1.1	There are several inherited and acquired immune deficiency disorders.
7.41.6.3.1.2	In some individuals, T or B cells never form; in others, B cells lose the ability to give rise to plasma cells.
7.41.6.3.1.3	In either case, the affected individual is unable to mount an adaptive immune response and thus lacks a major line of defense against pathogens.
7.41.6.3.1.4	The TH cell is perhaps the most central component of the immune system because of its essential roles in both the humoral and cellular immune responses (see Figure 41.6).
7.41.6.3.1.5	This cell is the target of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the retrovirus that results in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
7.41.6.3.2.1	HIV can be transmitted from person to person in body fluids containing the virus (such as blood, semen, or vaginal fluid).
7.41.6.3.2.2	The recipient tissue is either blood (by transfusion) or a mucous membrane lining an organ (the mucus contains a high concentration of lymphocytes).
7.41.6.3.2.3	HIV initially infects macrophages, TH cells, and antigen-presenting dendritic cells in the blood and tissues.
7.41.6.3.2.4	At first there is an immune response to the viral infection, and TH cells are activated.
7.41.6.3.2.5	But because HIV infects the TH cells, they are killed both by HIV itself and by TC cells that lyse infected TH cells.
7.41.6.3.2.6	Consequently TH cell numbers decline after the first month or so of infection.
7.41.6.3.2.7	Meanwhile, the extensive production of HIV by infected cells activates the humoral immune system.
7.41.6.3.2.8	Antibodies bind to HIV, and the complexes are removed by phagocytes.
7.41.6.3.2.9	The HIV level in blood goes down.
7.41.6.3.2.10	There is still a low level of infection, however, because of the depletion of TH cells (Figure 41.16).
7.41.6.3.2.11	This process reaches a low, steady-state level called the &#8220;set point. &#8221; This point varies among individuals and is a strong predictor of the rate of progression of the disease.
7.41.6.3.2.12	For most people it takes 8&#8211;10 years without treatment for the more severe manifestations of AIDS to develop.
7.41.6.3.2.13	In some it can take as little as a year; in others, 20 years.
7.41.6.3.2.14	Figure 41.16 The Course of an HIV Infection
7.41.6.3.3.1	During this dormant period, people carrying HIV generally feel fine, and their TH cell levels are adequate for them to mount immune responses.
7.41.6.3.3.2	Eventually, however, the virus destroys the TH cells, and their numbers fall to the point where the infected person is susceptible to infections that the TH cells would normally eliminate.
7.41.6.3.3.3	These infections result in conditions such as Kaposi&#8217;s sarcoma, a skin tumor caused by a herpes virus; pneumonia caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii; and lymphoma tumors caused by the Epstein&#8211;Barr virus.
7.41.6.3.3.4	These conditions result from opportunistic infections because the pathogens take advantage of the crippled immune system of the host.
7.41.6.3.3.5	They lead to death within a year or two.
7.41.6.3.4.1	HIV has been intensively studied.
7.41.6.3.4.2	This has resulted in the development of drugs targeted to HIV proteins, such as the reverse transcriptase that makes cDNA from the viral RNA, and the viral protease that cuts the large precursor viral protein into its final active proteins.
7.41.6.3.4.3	Treatment with combinations of such drugs has had spectacular success.
7.41.6.3.4.4	Getting AIDS before the 1990s was a death sentence, with few sufferers surviving beyond a year or two.
7.41.6.3.4.5	Today the survival of a treated, infected person is decades longer.
7.41.6.3.4.6	Unfortunately, like many medical treatments, HIV drugs are not available to all who need them&#8212;particularly in poor regions of the world where AIDS is prevalent.
7.41.6.3.4.7	Since AIDS is caused by a viral infection, a vaccine would seem an appropriate preventive agent.
7.41.6.3.4.8	Unfortunately, despite a huge international effort that is ongoing, a vaccine against HIV has not been developed, probably because the virus &#8220;hides out&#8221; inside cells and is prone to a high mutation rate.
7.41.6.3.4.9	There are about 1.2 million deaths per year worldwide from AIDS.
7.41.6.3.5.1	41.6 recap
7.41.6.3.6.1	Failures of the immune system include allergic reactions (caused by hypersensitivity to antigens), autoimmune diseases (caused by reactions against self antigens), and immune deficiency disorders.
7.41.6.3.7.1	learning outcomes
7.41.6.3.8.1	You should be able to:
7.41.6.3.9.1	Summarize the responses made during immediate hypersensitivity.
7.41.6.3.10.1	Describe how desensitization can be used to minimize allergic reactions.
7.41.6.3.11.1	Summarize the hypotheses that explain how autoimmunity can occur.
7.41.6.3.12.1	Outline experiments to test the effectiveness of an HIV vaccine.
7.41.6.3.13.1	Some people are allergic to peanuts.
7.41.6.3.13.2	Outline the events that characterize the immune reactions involved.
7.41.6.3.14.1	There has been recent progress in treating peanut allergy by desensitization.
7.41.6.3.14.2	How does this work?
7.41.6.3.15.1	A new cancer treatment involves promoting autoimmunity by designing a drug to inhibit CTLA4, a protein on T cells that normally blocks them from mounting an autoimmune response.
7.41.6.3.15.2	How does this treatment work?
7.41.6.3.15.3	What might be its side effects?
7.41.6.3.16.1	Development of an effective HIV vaccine requires that a person being vaccinated develop both cellular and humoral immunity against HIV.
7.41.6.3.16.2	What experiments would you perform to test whether both types of immunity developed in people given a potential new vaccine?
7.41.6.3.17.1	investigatinglife
7.41.6.3.18.1	What are the mechanisms and implications of long-lasting immunity?
7.41.6.3.19.1	You have seen in this chapter that lasting immunity against a pathogen can be achieved in two ways, both of which involve exposure to an antigen associated with the pathogen and the resulting production of memory cells.
7.41.6.3.19.2	The first way is natural: In Investigating Life: What Are the Mechanisms andImplications of Long Lasting Immunity?, we showed that people exposed to virulent strains of flu viruses retain their immunity, and even increase it when exposed to less harmful flu strain.
7.41.6.3.19.3	The second way is artificial: As we described in the opening story, vaccines have been spectacularly successful at inducing lasting immunity and even eradicating diseases when enough people are vaccinated.
7.41.6.3.19.4	Why, then, do people refuse vaccination?There appear to be several reasons.
7.41.6.3.19.5	One is complacency&#8212;the threat of disease may seem remot.
7.41.6.3.19.6	For example, measles, which used to kill thousands of children every year in the United Statesand still does in poor countries, is no longer a highly visible threat to public health.
7.41.6.3.19.7	Second, some people believe that vaccines, although exhaustively tested and proven safe, are actually unsafe and cause disease.
7.41.6.3.19.8	The internet is full of such assertions.
7.41.6.3.19.9	Third, false alarms haveled people to dismiss vaccination advisories.
7.41.6.3.19.10	The discovery of the H1N1 flu virus (swine flu) in Mexico in 2009 led to a high alert and a mass vaccination program that turned out not to benecessary.
7.41.6.3.19.11	In addition, some people are suspicious of governmental programs in general.
7.41.6.3.19.12	In Pakistan, a polio vaccination program was used as a ruse by officials to gain access to the home of the internationalterrorist Osama bin Laden.
7.41.6.3.19.13	Vaccination is a scientific success in terms ofbolstering immunity and eradicating disease.
7.41.6.3.19.14	But like any technology, its acceptance is a political issue.
7.41.6.3.20.1	Future directions
7.41.6.3.21.1	Following activation of the immune system, many effector cells are mobilized.
7.41.6.3.21.2	Most eventually die, but some survive as memory cells.
7.41.6.3.21.3	Researchers are investigating how this happens.
7.41.6.3.21.4	At the University of Wisconsin, Marulasiddappa Suresh and his colleagues have shown that a single transcription factor called FoxO1 plays an important role in the effector-to-memory-cell transition.
7.41.6.3.21.5	This molecule is not needed for the production of effector cells, but if it is not there, memory cells do not form.
7.41.6.3.21.6	The genes regulated by FoxO1 are being characterized and may hold the key to the memory cell.
7.41.6.3.21.7	Meanwhile, at Yale University, Susan Kaech and her colleagues have shown that an intercellular signaling molecule, interleukin-7 (IL-7), binds to effector cells and results in changes that may allow memory cell survival.
7.41.6.3.21.8	Specifically, the target cells produce a membrane channel that allows rapid uptake of glycerol, the backbone of fats.
7.41.6.3.21.9	Production of fats in the memory cell may provide the energy needed for long-term survival.
7.41.6.3.21.10	Understanding how memory cells form and survive may provide valuable information for the production of better vaccines.

7.41.summary.2.1	Animals Use Innate and Adaptive Mechanisms for Defense
7.41.summary.3.1	Animal defenses against pathogens are based on the body&#8217;s ability to distinguish between self and nonself.
7.41.summary.4.1	Innate (nonspecific) defenses are inherited mechanisms that protect the body from many kinds of pathogens.
7.41.summary.4.2	They typically act rapidly.
7.41.summary.5.1	Adaptive (specific) defenses respond to specific pathogens.
7.41.summary.5.2	They develop more slowly than innate defenses but are longer-lasting.
7.41.summary.6.1	Innate defenses evolved before adaptive defenses, and in animals there is a common signaling pathway that sets innate defenses in motion.
7.41.summary.6.2	Review Figure 41.1

7.41.summary.14.1	Adaptive Defenses Are Specific
7.41.summary.15.1	The adaptive immune response recognizes specific antigens, responds to an enormous diversity of antigenic determinants (epitopes), distinguishes self from nonself, and remembers the antigens it has encountered.
7.41.summary.15.2	Review Animation 41.1
7.41.summary.16.1	Each antibody and each T cell is specific for a single antigenic determinant.
7.41.summary.16.2	T cell receptors and antibodies bind to antigens and initiate an adaptive immune response.
7.41.summary.17.1	The humoral immune response is directed against pathogens in the blood, lymph, and tissue fluids.
7.41.summary.17.2	The cellular immune response is directed against an antigen established within a host cell.

7.41.summary.21.1	The Humoral Adaptive Response Involves Antibodies
7.41.summary.22.1	See Animation 41.2
7.41.summary.23.1	B cells are the basis of the humoral immune response.
7.41.summary.23.2	Unexposed B cells are activated by binding of antigen and by stimulation by TH cells with the same specificity, and then form plasma cells.
7.41.summary.23.3	These cells synthesize and secrete specific antibodies.
7.41.summary.24.1	An antibody is an immunoglobulin, a tetramer of four polypeptides: two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains, each consisting of a constant region and a variable region.
7.41.summary.24.2	Review Figure 41.8, Activity 41.4
7.41.summary.25.1	The variable regions determine the specificity of an immunoglobulin, and the constant regions of the heavy chain determine its class.
7.41.summary.25.2	There are five classes of immunoglobulins with different body locations and functions.
7.41.summary.25.3	Review Table 41.2
7.41.summary.26.1	B cell genomes undergo random recombination of genes coding for regions of the immunoglobulin polypeptide chains so that each cell can produce a specific antibody protein.
7.41.summary.26.2	The immunoglobulin chains derive from &#8220;supergenes&#8221; that are constructed from different combinations of V, D, J, and C genes.
7.41.summary.26.3	This DNA rearrangement and rejoining yields millions of different immunoglobulin chains.
7.41.summary.26.4	Review Figures 41.9, 41.10, Animation 41.3
7.41.summary.27.1	Once a B cell becomes a plasma cell, it may undergo class switching, in which a deletion of one or more constant region genes results in the production of an immunoglobulin with a different constant region and a different function. 41.5

7.41.summary.29.1	See Animation 41.4
7.41.summary.30.1	T cells are the effectors of the cellular immune response.
7.41.summary.30.2	T cell receptors are somewhat similar in structure to the immunoglobulins, having variable and constant regions.
7.41.summary.30.3	Review Figure 41.11
7.41.summary.31.1	The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) encode membrane proteins that bind antigenic fragments and present them to T cells.

7.41.summary.32.1	There are three types of T cells.
7.41.summary.32.2	Cytotoxic T cells (TC cells) recognize and kill virus-infected or mutated cells.
7.41.summary.32.3	T-helper cells (TH cells) assist both the cellular and humoral immune responses.

7.41.summary.35.1	Autoimmune diseases result when the immune system produces B and T cells that attack self antigens.
7.41.summary.36.1	Immune deficiency disorders result from failure of some part of the immune system.

7.41.summary.46.1	Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a very rare inherited condition in which individuals show high susceptibility to viral, fungal, and bacterial infection.
7.41.summary.46.2	Left untreated, it is fatal.
7.41.summary.46.3	SCID can be caused by mutations in any of several genes, one of which codes for the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADA).
7.41.summary.46.4	ADA is produced in all cells, but the highest levels are found in lymphocytes.
7.41.summary.47.1	Inside lymphocytes, when DNA is metabolized, toxic deoxyadenosine is produced.
7.41.summary.47.2	When ADA is present, deoxyadenosine is converted to a nontoxic molecule.
7.41.summary.47.3	When ADA is not present, deoxyadenosine accumulates and causes cell death, especially of T cells.
7.41.summary.48.1	There are currently three treatments for ADA-SCID.
7.41.summary.48.2	In enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), patients are injected with ADA, usually weekly.
7.41.summary.48.3	This restores normal levels of ADA (6&#8211;12&#924;mol/h/mL) and deoxyadenosine (less than 10 percent of adenine nucleotides) in blood and immune function.

7.41.summary.49.1	The second treatment method is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), in which stem cells from a donor give rise to lymphocytes that carry the normal ADA gene.
7.41.summary.49.2	These are transplanted into the patient.
7.41.summary.49.3	The greatest obstacle in HSCT is finding a donor whose cell surface markers (in this case, human leukocyte antigens, a type of MHC protein) are similar to those of the patient.
7.41.summary.49.4	To understand the significance of the matching process, 87 patients underwent HSCT with donors having various levels of &#8220;matching,&#8221; and were studied for long-term survival (Figure A).

7.41.summary.50.1	The third treatment for ADA-SCID, gene therapy, can be used when a matching stem cell donor is not available.
7.41.summary.50.2	Blood stem cells are removed from an ADA patient and then exposed in the lab to a viral vector that inserts the correct gene sequence for ADA into the cells.
7.41.summary.50.3	These modified cells are then returned to the patient.

7.42.9.1	No Time to Waste
7.42.10.1	Female tammar wallabies become sexually receptive and mate soon after they give birth.
7.42.10.2	The resulting embryo can be born any time from a month to a year later.
7.42.10.3	Humans have a set 9-month pregnancy, so this highly variable duration of pregnancy seems unusual and leads to questions of &#8220;why&#8221; and &#8220;how. &#8221; Knowing more about the development of the young wallaby, called a joey, helps.
7.42.10.4	The joey is very immature when born.
7.42.10.5	It crawls into its mother&#8217;s pouch (the marsupium) where it suckles and grows for up to 10 months when it is weaned.
7.42.11.1	Answering the &#8220;why&#8221; question is not difficult.
7.42.11.2	Reproductive success is the currency of evolution.
7.42.11.3	Reproductive success depends on how many offspring a female can produce and on the chances that those offspring survive, reproduce, and pass on their genes to the following generation.
7.42.11.4	Mating soon after giving birth (as the wallaby does) can maximize the number of offspring a female produces, but it does not necessarily maximize the survival and success of those offspring.
7.42.11.5	Survival of offspring in many species depends on the ability of the mother to provide maternal care.
7.42.11.6	Mammalian mothers produce milk to nourish their young, and that has an enormous energy cost.
7.42.11.7	Therefore the females of many mammalian species do not become fertile and sexually receptive until they have weaned their young.
7.42.11.8	But, this is not true for the tammar wallaby.
7.42.12.1	The large energy investment that a tammar wallaby mother makes to successfully rear a single offspring means that giving birth while still having one joey in the pouch lowers the chances of having either of those young survive.
7.42.12.2	The adaptation of this species is developmental arrest, or diapause.
7.42.12.3	The fertilized egg begins to develop into an embryo, but at an early stage of development its cell divisions cease, its metabolism decreases, and it remains in the uterus without implanting in the uterine lining as long as the previous offspring is suckling.
7.42.12.4	If that offspring dies or is weaned, the quiescent embryo in the uterus is activated, implants in the uterine lining, and continues its development.
7.42.12.5	Having an embryo ready to go when conditions are right is a way of maximizing reproductive success, but the &#8220;how&#8221; question remains.
7.42.13.1	Can learning be restored in mouse models of Down syndrome?

7.42.15.1	42.1 Asexual Reproduction Is Efficient but Limits Genetic Variability
7.42.1.1.1	Asexual reproduction limits genetic diversity
7.42.1.2.1	Budding and regeneration produce new individuals by mitosis
7.42.1.3.1	Parthenogenesis is the development of unfertilized eggs
7.42.1.4.1	When we think of reproduction, we think of sex, but many species can reproduce asexually&#8212;the offspring are exact genetic copies of the parents.
7.42.1.4.2	Most of the animal species that reproduce asexually are invertebrates living in rather constant environments.
7.42.1.4.3	However, examples of asexual reproduction do occur in vertebrates.
7.42.1.4.4	Reproduction by female sharks living in aquaria with no males have been reported.
7.42.1.4.5	The natural habitat of these fish is the open ocean where potential mates might not be readily available.
7.42.1.4.6	Asexual reproduction is efficient because no time or energy is wasted on mating and every member of the population can convert resources into offspring.
7.42.1.5.1	focus your learning
7.42.1.6.1	Asexual reproduction does not generate genetic diversity.
7.42.1.7.1	Budding and regeneration are forms of asexual reproduction.
7.42.1.8.1	Parthenogenesis is the development of offspring from unfertilized eggs.
7.42.1.9.1	You can demonstrate to yourself the efficiency of asexual reproduction with a thought exercise.
7.42.1.9.2	Start with two females, one reproducing sexually and one asexually.
7.42.1.9.3	Assume that each can have two offspring, but in the case of the sexually reproducing female, one will be a male.
7.42.1.9.4	Also, assume that in each subsequent generation all of the females (mothers and daughters) will have two offspring each.
7.42.1.9.5	In the first generation, the asexually reproducing female will have two daughters who can then each have two female offspring.
7.42.1.9.6	Thus in the next generation there will be three females having two offspring each.
7.42.1.9.7	The sexually reproducing female will give rise to only one female, so in the next generation there will be two females reproducing having two offspring each&#8212;only one of which is female.
7.42.1.9.8	Run this thought exercise through four or five cycles and compare the numbers of offspring produced.
7.42.1.1.1.1	Figure 42.1 Aphids Are Sexual and Asexual
7.42.1.1.2.1	A disadvantage of asexual reproduction is that the offspring are genetically identical to one another and to their parents.
7.42.1.1.2.2	Thus asexual reproduction does not generate genetic diversity.
7.42.1.1.2.3	Genetic diversity is the raw material that enables natural selection to shape adaptations in response to environmental change.
7.42.1.1.2.4	When environmental changes occur, lack of genetic diversity can be disadvantageous to a population.
7.42.1.1.2.5	Asexual reproduction is, however, a good way to preserve a successful genotype in a stable environment.
7.42.1.1.2.6	Aphids are an example of a species that has it both ways (Figure 42.1).
7.42.1.1.2.7	In the spring, the aphids that hatch on rose bushes from overwintering eggs are all females.
7.42.1.1.2.8	Each of those aphids reproduces asexually to produce many more females&#8212;all genetically identical.
7.42.1.1.2.9	This is a time when there is plenty of food and the environment is stable.
7.42.1.1.2.10	When the conditions change due to drought or season, the females still reproduce asexually, but some of the offspring develop into males.
7.42.1.1.2.11	The ensuing sexual reproduction introduces genetic variation into the eggs that will remain dormant until favorable conditions return.
7.42.1.1.3.1	Three common modes of asexual reproduction are budding, regeneration, and parthenogenesis.
7.42.1.2.1.1	Figure 42.2 Two Forms of Asexual Reproduction
7.42.1.2.2.1	Many simple multicellular animals produce offspring by budding.
7.42.1.2.2.2	New individuals form as outgrowths or buds from the bodies of older animals.
7.42.1.2.2.3	A bud grows by mitotic cell division, and the cells differentiate before the bud breaks away from the parent (Figure 42.2A).
7.42.1.2.2.4	The bud is genetically identical to the parent, and it may grow as large as the parent before it becomes independent.
7.42.1.2.3.1	Regeneration is usually thought of as the replacement of damaged tissues or lost limbs, but in some cases pieces of an organism can regenerate complete individuals.
7.42.1.2.3.2	Echinoderms, for example, have remarkable abilities to regenerate.
7.42.1.2.3.3	If sea stars are cut into pieces, each piece that includes an arm and a portion of the central disc can grow into a new animal (Figure 42.2B).
7.42.1.2.3.4	In the early 1900s oyster fishermen in Narragansett Bay tried to eliminate the sea stars that were preying on their oysters.
7.42.1.2.3.5	Whenever they encountered sea stars, they cut them up with their knives and threw them back into the water.
7.42.1.2.3.6	As a result, the sea star population increased explosively.
7.42.1.2.3.7	A variant of regeneration called fission involves the animal splitting in half with each half growing into a whole individual.
7.42.1.2.3.8	An example is sea anemones.
7.42.1.2.4.1	Regeneration can occur when an animal is broken by an outside force such as wave action in the intertidal zone.
7.42.1.2.4.2	In some cases, breakage occurs in the absence of external forces.
7.42.1.2.4.3	Some species of segmented marine worms develop segments with rudimentary heads bearing sensory organs.
7.42.1.2.4.4	The segments then break apart and each one forms a new worm.
7.42.1.3.1.1	Not all eggs must be fertilized to develop.
7.42.1.3.1.2	A common mode of asexual reproduction in arthropods (including aphids) is the development of offspring from unfertilized eggs.
7.42.1.3.1.3	This phenomenon, called parthenogenesis, also occurs in some species of fish, amphibians, and reptiles.
7.42.1.3.1.4	Most species that reproduce parthenogenetically also engage in sexual reproduction or at least sexual behavior at other times.
7.42.1.3.1.5	In some species, parthenogenesis is part of the mechanism that determines sex.
7.42.1.3.1.6	In honeybees (as well as in most ants and wasps), males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid, whereas females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid.
7.42.1.3.1.7	Figure 42.3 Asexual Reproduction May Require Sexual Behavior (A)
7.42.1.3.2.1	Parthenogenetic reproduction in some species requires sexual behavior even though sperm are not involved and eggs are not fertilized.
7.42.1.3.2.2	David Crews and his students at the University of Texas extensively investigated one such case, that of parthenogenetic reproduction in a species of whiptail lizard.
7.42.1.3.2.3	There are no males of this species.
7.42.1.3.2.4	Females can act as males, engaging in all aspects of courtship display and mating, although no sperm are produced or transferred (Figure 42.3).
7.42.1.3.2.5	Whether a specific female acts as a female or as a male depends on cyclical hormonal states.
7.42.1.3.2.6	When estrogen levels are high, she acts as a female.
7.42.1.3.2.7	When her progesterone levels peak, she acts as a male.
7.42.1.3.2.8	The stimulation resulting from the sexual activity triggers the release of eggs from the ovaries of the acting female.
7.42.1.3.3.1	42.1 recap
7.42.1.3.4.1	Many species of animals, especially invertebrates, can reproduce asexually through budding, regeneration, or parthenogenesis.
7.42.1.3.4.2	Asexual reproduction is an efficient use of resources but does not produce genetic diversity.
7.42.1.3.5.1	learning outcomes
7.42.1.3.6.1	You should be able to:
7.42.1.3.7.1	Describe circumstances that make asexual reproduction disadvantageous.
7.42.1.3.8.1	Describe the characteristics of the different types of asexual reproduction.
7.42.1.3.9.1	Explain conditions that would favor parthenogenesis over other forms of asexual reproduction.
7.42.1.3.10.1	What is similar about budding and regeneration but not parthenogenesis?
7.42.1.3.11.1	Is global climate change likely to have a more negative impact on a species that reproduces asexually or one that reproduces sexually?
7.42.1.3.12.1	The Komodo dragon is a very large, sexually breeding species of lizard that lives on the Indonesian island of Komodo.
7.42.1.3.12.2	A young Komodo dragon named Flora was raised alone for many years in the London Zoo.
7.42.1.3.12.3	One year after reaching sexual maturity, she laid a clutch of eggs that produced several baby dragons, all males.
7.42.1.3.12.4	How did Flora reproduce?
7.42.1.3.12.5	What advantage might this ability have for an island-dwelling species?
7.42.1.3.12.6	Why is it significant that the offspring were all male?
7.42.1.3.13.1	Asexual reproduction is an efficient way to use resources.
7.42.1.3.13.2	Since most animals reproduce sexually, however, the genetic diversity produced by sexual reproduction must confer a tremendous advantage.
7.42.1.3.14.1	Chapter 42 continues with
7.42.1.3.15.1	42.2 Sexual Reproduction Involves the Union of Haploid Egg and Sperm
7.42.2.1.1	Gametogenesis produces eggs and sperm
7.42.2.2.1	Fertilization is the union of sperm and egg
7.42.2.3.1	Spawning and mating behaviors get eggs and sperm together
7.42.2.4.1	Some individuals can function as both male and female
7.42.2.5.1	The evolution of vertebrate reproductive systems parallels the move to land
7.42.2.6.1	Animals with internal fertilization are distinguished by where the embryo develops
7.42.2.7.1	Given the inefficiency of sexual reproduction, its prevalence is somewhat surprising.
7.42.2.7.2	In most sexually reproducing species, the sex ratio is 1:1 and therefore half the population (males) cannot produce offspring.
7.42.2.7.3	And mating behaviors involve costs and risks.
7.42.2.7.4	Costs include time and energy spent finding, attracting, and competing for a mate, as well as the &#8220;opportunity costs&#8221; of detracting from other activities such as feeding and caring for existing offspring.
7.42.2.7.5	Risks include increased exposure to predation and the potential for physical damage.
7.42.2.7.6	Despite these disadvantages, most eukaryotic organisms reproduce sexually.
7.42.2.7.7	Thus it would seem that the production of genetic diversity is an evolutionary advantage that can overwhelm the cost of sex (see Key Concepts 20.2 and 20.4).
7.42.2.8.1	focus your learning
7.42.2.9.1	In spermatogenesis, four haploid sperm are produced from each primary spermatocyte.
7.42.2.10.1	Oogenesis involves asymmetrical division of cytoplasm.
7.42.2.11.1	Specific recognition molecules mediate interactions between sperm and eggs in sea urchins.
7.42.2.12.1	Organisms in aquatic environments generally have external fertilization and engage in spawning to bring eggs and sperm together.
7.42.2.13.1	Mechanisms of internal fertilization are highly diverse.
7.42.2.14.1	Hermaphrodites can function both as male and as female.
7.42.2.15.1	Sexual reproduction requires the joining of two haploid sex cells to form a diploid individual.
7.42.2.15.2	These haploid cells, or gametes, are produced through gametogenesis, a process that involves meiotic cell divisions.
7.42.2.15.3	Two events in meiosis contribute to genetic diversity: crossing over between homologous chromosomes and the independent assortment of chromosomes (see Key Concepts 11.5 and 12.1).
7.42.2.15.4	Mating behavior itself also contributes to genetic diversity.
7.42.2.15.5	The genetic variation among the gametes of a single individual and the genetic variation between any two parents produce an enormous potential for genetic variation between any two offspring of a sexually reproducing pair of individuals.
7.42.2.16.1	Sexual reproduction in animals consists of three fundamental steps:
7.42.2.17.1	Gametogenesis: making gametes
7.42.2.18.1	Spawning or mating: bringing gametes together
7.42.2.19.1	Fertilization: fusing gametes
7.42.2.20.1	The process of gametogenesis is similar across sexually reproducing animal species.
7.42.2.20.2	Processes of fertilization are also quite similar in widely different species.
7.42.2.20.3	Therefore, while our discussion of gametogenesis will focus generally on mammals, and our discussion of fertilization will feature sea urchins, the facts would not be dramatically different were we to consider many other animal groups.
7.42.2.20.4	Adaptations for spawning and mating, in contrast, show incredible anatomical, physiological, and behavioral diversity across species.
7.42.2.1.1.1	Gametogenesis occurs in the gonads: male testes (singular testis) and female ovaries (singular ovary).
7.42.2.1.1.2	The tiny male gametes, sperm, move by beating their flagella.
7.42.2.1.1.3	The larger female gametes, eggs or ova (singular ovum), are nonmotile.
7.42.2.1.2.1	Gametes are produced from germ cells, which have their origin in early cell divisions of the embryo and remain distinct from all the other cells of the body (the somatic cells).
7.42.2.1.2.2	Germ cells are sequestered in the body of the embryo until its gonads begin to form.
7.42.2.1.2.3	The germ cells then migrate to the developing gonads, where they take up residence and proliferate by mitosis, producing spermatogonia (singular spermatogonium) in males and oogonia (singular oogonium) in females (Figure 42.4).
7.42.2.1.2.4	Spermatogonia and oogonia are diploid, multiply by mitosis, and are stem cells.
7.42.2.1.2.5	They are self-regenerating, and they also produce progeny&#8212;spermatocytes and oocytes&#8212;that will enter the next stage of gametogenesis.
7.42.2.1.2.6	Figure 42.4 Gametogenesis
7.42.2.1.3.1	In the next stage of gametogenesis, meiotic cell division reduces the chromosomes to the haploid number (see Key Concept 11.5).
7.42.2.1.3.2	The progeny of the spermatogonia and oogonia that enter meiosis are primary spermatocytes and primary oocytes.
7.42.2.1.3.3	The steps of meiosis are similar in males and females, but there are important sex differences in gametogenesis.
7.42.2.1.1.1.1	The initial proliferation of male germ cells into spermatogonia proceeds by mitosis in the embryo.
7.42.2.1.1.1.2	But throughout the male life span, spermatogonia continue to divide by mitosis, with one daughter cell retaining the self-regenerating capacity of a spermatogonium while the other daughter cell becomes a primary spermatocyte.
7.42.2.1.1.1.3	As illustrated in Figure 42.4A, primary spermatocytes then undergo the first meiotic division&#8212;the reduction division&#8212;to form two haploid secondary spermatocytes.
7.42.2.1.1.1.4	The second meiotic division produces four haploid spermatids for each primary spermatocyte that enters meiosis.
7.42.2.1.1.1.5	In mammals, the progeny of primary spermatocytes remain connected by cytoplasmic bridges after each division.
7.42.2.1.1.2.1	One reason that mammalian spermatocytes remain in cytoplasmic contact throughout their development is the asymmetry of sex chromosomes in males.
7.42.2.1.1.2.2	Half the secondary spermatocytes receive an X chromosome, the other half a Y chromosome.
7.42.2.1.1.2.3	The Y chromosome contains fewer genes than the X chromosome, and some of the products of genes found only on the X chromosome are essential for spermatocyte development.
7.42.2.1.1.2.4	By remaining in cytoplasmic contact, all four spermatocytes can share the gene products of the X chromosomes, although only half of them have an X chromosome.
7.42.2.1.1.3.1	A spermatid bears little resemblance to a mature sperm.
7.42.2.1.1.3.2	Through further differentiation the spermatid becomes compact, streamlined, and developes a flagellum to become motile.
7.42.2.1.1.3.3	We will look at the production of human sperm in Key Concept 42.3.
7.42.2.1.2.1.1	Oogonia, like spermatogonia, proliferate through mitosis (see Figure 42.4B).
7.42.2.1.2.1.2	The resulting primary oocytes immediately enter prophase of the first meiotic division.
7.42.2.1.2.1.3	In many species, including humans, the oocyte experiences developmental arrest at this point and may remain in that state for days, months, or years.
7.42.2.1.2.1.4	In the human female, this period of arrest is at least 10 years (i. e. , until puberty), and some primary oocytes remain in prophase I for over 50 years (i. e. , until menopause).
7.42.2.1.2.1.5	In contrast, spermatogenesis continues, uninterrupted, to completion once the primary spermatocyte has differentiated.
7.42.2.1.2.2.1	During the prolonged prophase I, or shortly before it ends, the primary oocyte grows larger through increased production of ribosomes, RNA, cytoplasmic organelles, and energy stores.
7.42.2.1.2.2.2	At this point the primary oocyte acquires all the energy, raw materials, and RNA that the egg will need to survive its first cell divisions after fertilization.
7.42.2.1.2.2.3	In fact, the nutrients in the egg must maintain the embryo until it is either nourished by the maternal circulatory system or can feed on its own.
7.42.2.1.2.3.1	When a primary oocyte resumes meiosis, its nucleus completes the first meiotic division near the surface of the cell.
7.42.2.1.2.3.2	The daughter cells of this division receive grossly unequal shares of cytoplasm.
7.42.2.1.2.3.3	This asymmetry represents another major difference from spermatogenesis, in which cytoplasm is apportioned equally.
7.42.2.1.2.3.4	The daughter cell that receives almost all the cytoplasm becomes the secondary oocyte, and the one that receives almost none forms the first polar body (see Figure 42.4B).
7.42.2.1.2.4.1	The second meiotic division&#8212;that of the large, secondary oocyte&#8212;is accompanied by asymmetrical division of the cytoplasm.
7.42.2.1.2.4.2	One daughter cell forms the large, haploid ootid that eventually differentiates into a mature egg, and the other forms the second polar body.
7.42.2.1.2.4.3	In most species the polar bodies rapidly degenerate, so the end result of oogenesis is only one mature egg for each primary oocyte that entered meiosis.
7.42.2.1.2.4.4	However, that egg is a large, well-provisioned cell.
7.42.2.1.2.4.5	In a few species the polar bodies have evolved specialized functions.
7.42.2.1.2.4.6	In some species that reproduce parthenogenetically, a polar body can fuse with the egg to restore the diploid number of chromosomes.
7.42.2.1.2.4.7	In some insect species the polar bodies form organs with specialized functions.
7.42.2.1.2.4.8	An example is scale insects in which cells derived from the polar bodies form a container for endosymbiotic bacteria that the insects require for life.
7.42.2.1.2.5.1	A second period of arrested development occurs after the first meiotic division forms the secondary oocyte.
7.42.2.1.2.5.2	The egg may be expelled from the ovary in this condition.
7.42.2.1.2.5.3	In many species, including humans, the second meiotic division is not completed until the egg is fertilized by a sperm.
7.42.2.2.1.1	The union of the haploid sperm and the haploid egg (fertilization) creates a single diploid cell, a zygote, which will develop into an embryo.
7.42.2.2.1.2	Fertilization does more than just restore the full genetic complement of the animal.
7.42.2.2.1.3	The processes associated with fertilization help the egg and sperm get together, prevent the union of the sperm and egg of different species, and guarantee that only one sperm will enter and activate the egg.
7.42.2.2.1.4	Fertilization involves a complex series of events:
7.42.2.2.2.1	The sperm and the egg chemically recognize each other.
7.42.2.2.3.1	The sperm is activated, enabling it to gain access to the cell membrane of the egg.
7.42.2.2.4.1	The cell membrane of the egg fuses with the cell membrane of a single sperm.
7.42.2.2.5.1	The egg blocks entry of additional sperm.
7.42.2.2.6.1	The egg is metabolically activated and stimulated to start development.
7.42.2.2.7.1	The egg and sperm nuclei fuse to create the diploid nucleus of the zygote.
7.42.2.2.2.1.1	Specific recognition molecules mediate interactions between sperm and eggs.
7.42.2.2.2.1.2	These molecules ensure that the activities of sperm are directed toward eggs and not other cells, and they help prevent eggs from being fertilized by sperm from the wrong species.
7.42.2.2.2.1.3	The latter function is particularly important in aquatic species that release eggs and sperm into the surrounding water where the eggs can readily be exposed to sperm of other species.
7.42.2.2.2.1.4	The sea urchin is a good example of such a species, and sea urchin fertilization has been well studied.
7.42.2.2.2.2.1	Sea urchin eggs release chemical attractants that increase the motility of sperm and cause them to swim toward the egg.
7.42.2.2.2.2.2	These chemical attractants are species-specific.
7.42.2.2.2.2.3	For example, eggs of one species of sea urchin release a specific peptide consisting of 14 amino acids.
7.42.2.2.2.2.4	This peptide binds to receptors present on sperm of the same species.
7.42.2.2.2.2.5	The sperm respond by increasing their mitochondrial respiration and motility.
7.42.2.2.2.2.6	Before exposure to the peptide, the sperm swim in tight little circles, but after binding to the peptide, they swim energetically up the concentration gradient of the peptide until they reach the egg that is releasing it.
7.42.2.2.2.3.1	When sperm reach an egg, they must get through two protective layers before they can fuse with the egg cell membrane.
7.42.2.2.2.3.2	The eggs of sea urchins are covered with a jelly coat that surrounds a proteinaceous vitelline envelope (Figure 42.5A).
7.42.2.2.2.3.3	The success of a sperm&#8217;s assault on these protective layers depends on a membrane-enclosed structure at the front of the sperm head called an acrosome.
7.42.2.2.2.3.4	Figure 42.5 Fertilization of the Sea Urchin Egg
7.42.2.2.2.4.1	The acrosome contains enzymes and other proteins.
7.42.2.2.2.4.2	When a sperm makes contact with an egg of its own species, substances in the jelly coat trigger an acrosomal reaction, which begins with the breakdown of the cell membrane covering the sperm head and the underlying acrosomal membrane (Figure 42.5B).
7.42.2.2.2.4.3	The acrosomal enzymes are released and digest a hole through the jelly coat.
7.42.2.2.2.5.1	As a result of the polymerization of actin triggered by the acrosomal reaction, an acrosomal process extends out of the head of the sperm.
7.42.2.2.2.5.2	The acrosomal process is coated with species-specific recognition molecules called bindin, and there are bindin receptors on the vitelline envelope of the egg.
7.42.2.2.2.5.3	The interaction of bindin with their receptors enables the sperm to contact the egg cell membrane.
7.42.2.2.2.5.4	That contact results in fusion of the sperm and egg cell membranes and the formation of a fertilization cone that engulfs the sperm head, bringing it into the egg cytoplasm.
7.42.2.2.2.5.5	The sperm mitochondria, which largely constitute the midpiece of the sperm, are also drawn into the egg cytoplasm, but they degrade and disappear; this means that the mitochondria and *mitochondrial genes of the new urchin are derived only from the egg.
7.42.2.2.2.6.1	*connect the concepts Because mitochondrial genes are inherited only from the mother, traits controlled by those genes are not inherited in a Mendelian fashion (see Key Concept 12.5), and they enable establishment of matrilineal phylogenies (see Key Concept 21.2).
7.42.2.2.2.7.1	In animals that practice internal fertilization, mating behaviors help guarantee species specificity, but egg   sperm recognition mechanisms still exist.
7.42.2.2.2.7.2	The mammalian egg is surrounded by a thick layer called the cumulus consisting of a loose assemblage of maternal cells in a gelatinous matrix (Figure 42.6).
7.42.2.2.2.7.3	Beneath the cumulus is a glycoprotein envelope called the zona pellucida, which is functionally similar to the vitelline envelope of sea urchin eggs.
7.42.2.2.2.7.4	Mammalian sperm become activated when they are deposited in the female reproductive tract, and they are then capable of an acrosomal reaction should they encounter an egg.
7.42.2.2.2.7.5	An activated sperm can penetrate the cumulus and interact with the zona pellucida.
7.42.2.2.2.8.1	Figure 42.6 Barriers to Sperm This human egg, like other mammalian eggs, is surrounded by the cumulus and zona pellucida.
7.42.2.2.2.8.2	Sperm must penetrate both to fertilize the egg.
7.42.2.2.2.8.3	Only one sperm will penetrate the zona pellucida and fuse with the egg cell membrane.
7.42.2.2.2.9.1	Unlike the jelly coat of sea urchin eggs, the cumulus of mammalian eggs does not trigger the acrosomal reaction.
7.42.2.2.2.9.2	When sperm make contact with the zona pellucida, a species-specific glycoprotein binds to recognition molecules on the head of the sperm.
7.42.2.2.2.9.3	This binding triggers the acrosomal reaction, releasing acrosomal enzymes that digest a path through the zona pellucida.
7.42.2.2.2.9.4	When the sperm head reaches the egg cell membrane, other proteins facilitate its adhesion to and fusion with the egg cell membrane.
7.42.2.2.3.1.1	The fusion of the sperm and egg cell membranes and the entry of the sperm into the egg initiate a programmed sequence of events.
7.42.2.2.3.1.2	The first responses to sperm entry are blocks to polyspermy: mechanisms that prevent more than one sperm from entering the egg.
7.42.2.2.3.1.3	Survival of the embryo is unlikely if more than one sperm enters the egg.
7.42.2.2.3.1.4	The sperm contributes a haploid set of chromosomes, so an extra set would disrupt the mitotic division of the egg and subsequent cells.
7.42.2.2.3.1.5	In addition, in most mammals the sperm contributes a centriole to the fertilized egg, and the *centriole forms the centrosome which is critical for organizing the mitotic spindle.
7.42.2.2.3.1.6	Having two centrosomes would disrupt mitosis of the fertilized egg.
7.42.2.2.3.2.1	*connect the concepts The roles of the centriole and the centrosome in mitosis are discussed in Key Concept 11.3.
7.42.2.2.3.3.1	Blocks to polyspermy have been studied extensively in sea urchin eggs, which can be fertilized in a dish of seawater.
7.42.2.2.3.3.2	Within seconds after the sperm membrane contacts the egg membrane, an influx of sodium ions changes the electric charge difference across the egg cell membrane.
7.42.2.2.3.3.3	This fast block to polyspermy prevents the fusion of any other sperm with the egg cell membrane, but it is transient.
7.42.2.2.3.3.4	The change in membrane electric charge lasts only about a minute, but that is enough time to allow a slower block to sperm entry to develop.
7.42.2.2.3.4.1	The slow block to polyspermy involves converting the vitelline envelope to a physical barrier that sperm cannot penetrate.
7.42.2.2.3.4.2	Before fertilization, the vitelline envelope is bonded to the egg cell membrane.
7.42.2.2.3.4.3	Just under the cell membrane are vesicles called cortical granules (see Figure 42.5) which contain enzymes and other proteins.
7.42.2.2.3.5.1	The sea urchin egg, like all animal cells, sequesters calcium in its endoplasmic reticulum.
7.42.2.2.3.5.2	Sperm entry into the egg stimulates the release of calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum and into the egg cytosol.
7.42.2.2.3.5.3	This increase in cytosolic calcium causes the egg&#8217;s cortical granules to fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents.
7.42.2.2.3.5.4	Cortical granule enzymes break the bonds between the vitelline envelope and the cell membrane, and other proteins released from the cortical granules attract water into the space between them.
7.42.2.2.3.5.5	As a result, the vitelline envelope rises to form a fertilization envelope.
7.42.2.2.3.5.6	Cortical granule enzymes also degrade sperm-binding molecules on the surface of the fertilization envelope and cause it to harden, thus preventing additional sperm from contacting the egg cell membrane.
7.42.2.2.3.6.1	In mammalian eggs, sperm entry does not cause a rapid change in membrane potential, but it does trigger a release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum.
7.42.2.2.3.6.2	As in the sea urchin egg, increased calcium causes the cortical granules to fuse egg with the egg cell membrane.
7.42.2.2.3.6.3	A fertilization envelope does not form around the mammalian egg, but the cortical granule enzymes destroy the sperm-binding molecules in the zona pellucida.
7.42.2.2.3.6.4	The rise in cytosolic calcium also signals the egg to complete meiosis.
7.42.2.2.3.6.5	The stage is set for the first cell division.
7.42.2.3.1.1	As you have just seen, sexual reproduction requires the production of haploid gametes (gametogenesis) and the joining together of those gametes to form a diploid zygote (fertilization).
7.42.2.3.1.2	Spawning and mating behaviors get eggs and sperm close enough together that fertilization can occur.
7.42.2.3.1.3	Fertilization can occur externally or internally.
7.42.2.3.1.1.1	In an aquatic environment, animals can bring their gametes together by simply releasing them into the water.
7.42.2.3.1.1.2	This practice, called spawning, results in external fertilization.
7.42.2.3.1.1.3	Many aquatic animals are not very mobile, but they produce huge numbers of gametes that can travel far from the point of release.
7.42.2.3.1.1.4	A female oyster, for example, will release millions of eggs when she spawns, and the number of sperm produced by a male oyster is astronomical.
7.42.2.3.1.2.1	Numbers alone, however, do not guarantee that gametes will meet.
7.42.2.3.1.2.2	The reproductive activities of the males and females of a population must be synchronized, since released gametes have a limited life span.
7.42.2.3.1.2.3	Seasonal breeders may use day length, changes in temperature, or changes in weather to time the production and release of their gametes.
7.42.2.3.1.2.4	Mutual stimulation is also important.
7.42.2.3.1.2.5	Release of gametes into the water by one individual can stimulate others to spawn.
7.42.2.3.1.3.1	Behavior can play an important role in bringing gametes together even when fertilization is external.
7.42.2.3.1.3.2	Many species travel great distances to congregate with potential mates and release their gametes at the same time in a suitable environment.
7.42.2.3.1.3.3	Many salmon are an extreme example.
7.42.2.3.1.3.4	They hatch and develop in freshwater streams and then migrate to the ocean, where they remain for years.
7.42.2.3.1.3.5	When they are mature and ready to spawn, they travel hundreds of miles back to and then up the stream to the region where they hatched.
7.42.2.3.1.3.6	Males and females expend great amounts of energy to swim up the streams to the spawning grounds, where they pair up, prepare a depression in the streambed gravel, and together release their sperm and eggs.
7.42.2.3.1.3.7	As the gametes drift down into the gravel, fertilization occurs.
7.42.2.3.2.1.1	Terrestrial animals cannot simply release their gametes into the environment.
7.42.2.3.2.1.2	Sperm can move only through liquid, and delicate gametes released into air would dry out and die.
7.42.2.3.2.1.3	Most terrestrial animals avoid these problems by internal fertilization, the release of sperm into the female reproductive tract.
7.42.2.3.2.1.4	Some aquatic animals also practice internal fertilization, but it is ubiquitous in terrestrial animals.
7.42.2.3.2.2.1	Animals have evolved an astonishing diversity of behavioral and anatomical adaptations for internal fertilization.
7.42.2.3.2.2.2	The reproductive organs together are the animal&#8217;s genitalia.
7.42.2.3.2.2.3	Gametogenesis occurs in the gonads, which are the primary sex organs.
7.42.2.3.2.2.4	All additional components of an animal&#8217;s genitalia are called accessory sex organs.
7.42.2.3.2.2.5	The internal accessory sex organs include a variety of glands, tubules, ducts, and other structures.
7.42.2.3.2.2.6	External accessory sex organs are referred to as the external genitalia.
7.42.2.3.2.2.7	In males of many species, the external genitalia includes a penis that enables the male to deposit sperm in the female&#8217;s vagina, the entry to her reproductive tract.
7.42.2.3.2.3.1	Copulation is the physical joining of male and female accessory sex organs.
7.42.2.3.2.3.2	Most male insects copulate and transfer sperm to the female&#8217;s vagina through a penis.
7.42.2.3.2.3.3	The external genetalia of insects often have species-specific shapes that match in a lock-and-key fashion to ensure a tight, secure fit between the mating pair during the prolonged period of sperm transfer.
7.42.2.3.2.3.4	In some insect species in which females mate with more than one male, the male external genitalia includes elaborate structures that can scoop sperm deposited by other males out of the female&#8217;s reproductive tract, replacing it with his own.
7.42.2.3.2.4.1	Transfer of sperm in internal fertilization can also be indirect.
7.42.2.3.2.4.2	Males of many invertebrate species (e. g. , mites and scorpions) and a few vertebrates (e. g. , salamanders) deposit spermatophores&#8212;packets of sperm protected from desiccation&#8212;in the environment.
7.42.2.3.2.4.3	When a female mite encounters a spermatophore from a potential mate, she straddles it and opens a pair of plates in her abdomen so that the tip of the spermatophore enters her reproductive tract and allows the sperm to enter.
7.42.2.3.2.5.1	Male squid and spiders play a more active role in spermatophore transfer.
7.42.2.3.2.5.2	The male spider secretes a drop containing sperm onto a bit of web, then uses a special structure on his foreleg to pick up the sperm-containing web and insert it through the female&#8217;s genital opening.
7.42.2.3.2.5.3	Some male squid use one specialized tentacle to pick up a spermatophore and insert it into the female&#8217;s genital opening.
7.42.2.4.1.1	In most species, gametes are produced by individuals that are either male or female.
7.42.2.4.1.2	Species that have separate male and female members are referred to as dioecious (Greek, &#8220;two houses&#8221;).
7.42.2.4.1.3	In some species, however, a single individual may produce both sperm and eggs.
7.42.2.4.1.4	Such species are monoecious (&#8220;one house&#8221;), or hermaphroditic.
7.42.2.4.2.1	Almost all invertebrate groups contain some hermaphroditic species.
7.42.2.4.2.2	An earthworm is an example of a simultaneous hermaphrodite, meaning an individual is both male and female at the same time.
7.42.2.4.2.3	When two earthworms mate, they exchange sperm, and as a result the eggs of each are fertilized (see Figure 32.12C).
7.42.2.4.2.4	Some vertebrates are sequential hermaphrodites, meaning an individual may function as a male or a female at different times in its life.
7.42.2.4.2.5	An example is the anemone fish, or clown fish, a species that lives in small groups within large sea anemones (Figure 42.7).
7.42.2.4.2.6	All anemone fish are born male.
7.42.2.4.2.7	The largest fish in a group becomes a functional female.
7.42.2.4.2.8	If that fish is removed from the group, the next-largest male becomes a female.
7.42.2.4.2.9	The second-largest fish in the group is the only male in breeding condition.
7.42.2.4.2.10	The reverse situation also exists in some species where a large dominant male controls a harem of females.
7.42.2.4.2.11	If the male is removed, the largest female becomes the male in the group.
7.42.2.4.2.12	Figure 42.7 When Size Determines Sex
7.42.2.4.3.1	What is the evolutionary advantage of hermaphroditism?
7.42.2.4.3.2	Some simultaneous hermaphrodites, such as parasitic tapeworms, have a low probability of meeting a potential mate&#8212;an individual tapeworm may be the only one in its host.
7.42.2.4.3.3	Tapeworms can fertilize their own eggs, but most simultaneous hermaphrodites must mate with another individual.
7.42.2.4.3.4	Because every simultaneous hermaphrodite is both male and female, however, the probability of encountering a possible mate doubles.
7.42.2.4.3.5	In some sequential hermaphrodites, siblings are all male or all female at the same time, thus reducing the incidence of inbreeding.
7.42.2.5.1.1	The earliest vertebrates evolved in aquatic environments.
7.42.2.5.1.2	The closest living relatives of those earliest vertebrates are modern-day fishes.
7.42.2.5.1.3	They remain exclusively aquatic, and most practice external fertilization.
7.42.2.5.1.4	The most primitive fishes, the lampreys and hagfish, simply release their gametes into the environment.
7.42.2.5.1.5	In most fishes, however, mating behaviors bring females and males into close proximity at the time of gamete release.
7.42.2.5.1.6	In sharks and rays, fins have evolved into claspers that hold the male and female together and enable sperm to be transferred directly into the female reproductive tract.
7.42.2.5.2.1	Amphibians were the first vertebrates to live in terrestrial environments.
7.42.2.5.2.2	They dealt with the challenge of a dry environment by returning to water to reproduce, as most amphibians still do today.
7.42.2.5.3.1	Reptiles were the first vertebrate group to solve the problem of reproduction in the terrestrial environment (Figure 42.8).
7.42.2.5.3.2	Their solution was the amniote egg (see Figure 32.19A).
7.42.2.5.3.3	A hard or leathery shell protects the embryo and impedes water loss while allowing the diffusion of oxygen into the egg and carbon dioxide out of the egg.
7.42.2.5.3.4	The eggshell creates an obvious problem for fertilization.
7.42.2.5.3.5	Sperm cannot penetrate the shell, so they must reach the egg before the shell forms.
7.42.2.5.3.6	Hence internal fertilization and the evolution of accessory sex organs were necessary for the evolution of the amniote egg.
7.42.2.5.3.7	Figure 42.8 The Shelled Egg
7.42.2.5.4.1	Male snakes and lizards have paired hemipenes (hemipenis, sing. ), which can be engorged with blood and thereby extruded from the male&#8217;s body.
7.42.2.5.4.2	Only one hemipenis is inserted into the female&#8217;s reproductive tract.
7.42.2.5.4.3	It is usually rough or spiny at the end to achieve a secure hold while sperm are transferred down a groove on its surface.
7.42.2.5.4.4	Retractor muscles pull the hemipenis back into the male&#8217;s body when mating is completed.
7.42.2.5.4.5	Some evolutionarily ancient bird species have erectile penises that channel sperm along a groove into the female&#8217;s reproductive tract.
7.42.2.5.4.6	Birds with more recent evolutionary origins, however, do not have erectile penises; instead, the male and female simply bring their genital openings (cloacae, sing. cloaca) close together to transfer sperm.
7.42.2.5.4.7	Usually this involves the male standing on the female&#8217;s back (see Figure 42.8B).
7.42.2.5.5.1	All mammals practice internal fertilization.
7.42.2.5.5.2	Then, all except the prototherian mammals retain the developing embryo for some time in the female reproductive tract.
7.42.2.5.5.3	Prototherian mammals (the monotremes; see Figure 32.26) lay eggs.
7.42.2.5.5.4	The other mammals (the therians) vary enormously as to the developmental stage of their offspring at the time of birth.
7.42.2.5.5.5	As you saw at the beginning of the chapter, the tammar wallaby is extremely immature at birth.
7.42.2.5.5.6	By comparison, a horse foal can stand up soon after birth and is able to run within hours.
7.42.2.6.1.1	Two patterns of care and nurture of the embryo have evolved in animals: oviparity (egg laying) and viviparity (live bearing).
7.42.2.6.2.1	Oviparous animals lay eggs in the environment, and their embryos develop outside the mother&#8217;s body.
7.42.2.6.2.2	Oviparous terrestrial animals such as insects and reptiles&#8212;including birds&#8212; protect their eggs from desiccation with waterproof membranes or shells.
7.42.2.6.2.3	Oviparity is possible because eggs are stocked with abundant nutrients to supply the needs of the embryo.
7.42.2.6.2.4	Some oviparous animals engage in various forms of parental behavior to protect their eggs, but until the eggs hatch, the embryos depend entirely on the nutrients stored in the egg.
7.42.2.6.3.1	Viviparous animals retain the embryo within the mother&#8217;s body during its early developmental stages.
7.42.2.6.3.2	The embryo is nourished and its wastes removed through exchanges with the mother&#8217;s tissues.
7.42.2.6.3.3	Viviparity occurs in many vertebrate groups, but with the exception of the prototherians (the monotremes), viviparity is universal in mammals.
7.42.2.6.3.4	Therian mammals have a specialized portion of the female reproductive tract, the uterus or womb that contains the embryo until it is born.
7.42.2.6.3.5	The early embryo arriving in the uterus from the Fallopian tube implants into the lining of the uterus.
7.42.2.6.3.6	Implantation involves interactions between the tissues of the embryo and the uterus to form a placenta.
7.42.2.6.3.7	Intimate contact in the placenta between the blood of the embryo and the blood of the mother facilitates the exchange of nutrients and wastes.
7.42.2.6.4.1	In most non-mammalian viviparous animals, such as garter snakes and the well-known aquarium fish the guppy, fertilized eggs are retained in the mother&#8217;s body until they hatch.
7.42.2.6.4.2	These embryos still receive nutrition from stores in the egg, so this reproductive adaptation is called ovoviviparity.
7.42.2.6.5.1	42.2 recap
7.42.2.6.6.1	Sexual reproduction involves gametogenesis, mating, and fertilization.
7.42.2.6.6.2	Fertilization can be external or internal and involves mechanisms for ensuring that only one sperm from the right species enters the egg.
7.42.2.6.6.3	Oviparous female animals lay eggs in the environment, and their embryos develop outside the mother&#8217;s body.
7.42.2.6.6.4	Viviparous female animals retain the developing embryo in the uterus until it is born.

7.42.2.6.20.1	42.3  Male Sex Organs Produce and May Deliver Sperm
7.42.3.1.1	Semen is the product of the male reproductive system
7.42.3.2.1	The penis and the scrotum are the male external genitalia
7.42.3.3.1	Male sexual function is controlled by hormones
7.42.3.4.1	This section describes the structures and functions of the male reproductive system in mammals, using humans as the prime example.
7.42.3.4.2	You will also learn about the hormonal regulation of the male reproductive system.
7.42.3.4.3	The discussion covers:
7.42.3.5.1	The primary sex organs, testes, that produce sperm and serve endocrine functions.
7.42.3.6.1	The accessory sex organs, including the ducts through which the sperm pass, the glands that produce and deliver secretions into those ducts, and the external genitalia.
7.42.3.7.1	Secondary sexual characteristics that result in male appearance but are not directly involved in reproduction.
7.42.3.8.1	focus your learning
7.42.3.9.1	Semen contains sperm and a mixture of molecules that support the sperm and facilitate fertilization.
7.42.3.10.1	Sexual stimulation triggers responses in the nervous system and penile arterioles that result in erection.
7.42.3.11.1	Spermatogenesis and the maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics depend on testosterone.
7.42.3.1.1.1	Semen contains sperm and a complex mixture of fluids and molecules (seminal fluid) that support the sperm and facilitate fertilization.
7.42.3.1.1.2	Sperm make up less than 5 percent of the volume of the semen.
7.42.3.1.1.3	Sperm are produced in the testes, the paired male gonads, and the seminal fluid is produced by accessory glands.
7.42.3.1.2.1	Figure 42.9 illustrates the human male reproductive organs.
7.42.3.1.2.2	The testes of most mammals are located outside the body cavity in a pouch of skin called the scrotum.
7.42.3.1.2.3	Why should the testes be located outside the body cavity?
7.42.3.1.2.4	The optimal temperature for spermatogenesis in most mammals is slightly lower than the normal body temperature.
7.42.3.1.2.5	The scrotum keeps the testes at this optimal temperature.
7.42.3.1.2.6	Muscles in the scrotum contract in a cold environment, bringing the testes closer to the warmth of the body; in a hot environment the muscles relax, cooling the testes by suspending them farther from the body.
7.42.3.1.2.7	Figure 42.9 Reproductive Tract of the Human Male
7.42.3.1.3.1	Spermatogenesis takes place within the seminiferous tubules tightly coiled in each testis (Figure 42.10A).
7.42.3.1.3.2	Between the seminiferous tubules are clusters of Leydig cells that produce testosterone (Figure 42.10B).
7.42.3.1.3.3	Spermatogonia reside in the outer regions of the seminiferous tubules, just under the basement membrane.
7.42.3.1.3.4	Moving inward toward the lumen of the tubule are germ cells in successive stages of spermatogenesis (Figure 42.10C).
7.42.3.1.3.5	The germ cells are intimately associated with Sertoli cells that provide nutrients for the developing sperm and secrete several things including hormones and growth factors that are necessary for spermatogenesis (which is why Sertoli cells are sometimes called &#8220;nurse cells&#8221;).
7.42.3.1.3.6	Tight junctions (see Key Concept 6.2) between Sertoli cells create a blood   sperm barrier that prevents many harmful substances that can be circulating in the blood from getting to the developing sperm.
7.42.3.1.3.7	Figure 42.10 Spermatogenesis Takes Place in the Seminiferous Tubules
7.42.3.1.4.1	When the second meiotic division is complete, each primary spermatocyte has produced four spermatids (see Figure 42.4A).
7.42.3.1.4.2	The spermatids develop into spermatozoa as they migrate toward the lumen of the seminiferous tubule.
7.42.3.1.4.3	The nucleus becomes compact, and the surrounding cytoplasm is lost.
7.42.3.1.4.4	A flagellum&#8212;the sperm tail&#8212;develops.
7.42.3.1.4.5	The mitochondria that provide the energy for sperm motility become condensed into a midpiece between the head and tail.
7.42.3.1.4.6	An acrosome forms over the nucleus in the head of the sperm.
7.42.3.1.4.7	Immature sperm are shed into the lumen of the seminiferous tubule.
7.42.3.1.5.1	From the seminiferous tubules, sperm move into the epididymis (see Figure 42.9A), where they mature, become motile, and are stored.
7.42.3.1.5.2	The epididymis connects to the urethra via the vas deferens (plural vasa deferentia) and the ejaculatory duct.
7.42.3.1.5.3	The urethra originates in the bladder, runs through the penis, and opens to the outside of the body at the tip of the penis.
7.42.3.1.5.4	It serves as the common final duct for urine and semen.
7.42.3.1.6.1	The components of the semen other than sperm come from three accessory glands.
7.42.3.1.6.2	About 60 percent of the volume of semen is secreted by the paired seminal vesicles that empty into the vas deferens just before it joins the urethra.
7.42.3.1.6.3	Seminal fluid is thick because it contains mucus and fibrinogen, a protein also found in the blood, where it can polymerize to form blood clots.
7.42.3.1.6.4	Seminal fluid also contains the monosaccharide fructose, an energy source for the sperm.
7.42.3.1.7.1	The prostate gland contributes about 30 percent of the volume of the semen.
7.42.3.1.7.2	Prostate fluid is alkaline, so it neutralizes the acidity in the male and female reproductive tracts and makes these environments more hospitable to sperm.
7.42.3.1.7.3	The prostate also secretes a clotting enzyme that causes fibrinogen from the seminal vesicles to convert the semen into a clotted, gelatinous mass, facilitating the semen&#8217;s propulsion into the upper regions of the female reproductive tract.
7.42.3.1.7.4	Another prostate enzyme, fibrinolysin, then dissolves the clotted semen and liberates the sperm.
7.42.3.1.7.5	Prostaglandins&#8212;hormones produced by the prostate&#8212;stimulate contractions of the female reproductive tract.
7.42.3.1.8.1	The bulbourethral glands produce a small volume of an alkaline, mucoid secretion that helps neutralize acidity in the urethra and lubricate it to facilitate the passage of semen during the climax of sexual intercourse.
7.42.3.2.1.1	The shaft of the penis is covered with normal skin, but the highly sensitive tip, the glans penis, is covered with thinner, more sensitive skin that is especially responsive to sexual stimulation.
7.42.3.2.1.2	A fold of skin called the foreskin covers the glans of the human penis.
7.42.3.2.1.3	The procedure known as circumcision removes a portion of the foreskin.
7.42.3.2.2.1	Sexual stimulation triggers responses in the nervous system that result in penile erection.
7.42.3.2.2.2	Nerve endings release a neurotransmitter that causes the endothelial cells lining the penile blood vessels to release a gaseous neurotransmitter, nitric oxide (NO).
7.42.3.2.2.3	NO diffuses into the smooth muscle cells that control the diameter of the penile arteries and stimulates them to produce the second messenger cGMP (see Figure 7.13).
7.42.3.2.2.4	Increased cGMP in these muscle cells causes them to relax; the arteries dilate and carry more blood into the penis.
7.42.3.2.2.5	Increased blood flow swells the shafts of spongy erectile tissue located along the length of the penis (see Figure 42.9).
7.42.3.2.2.6	The enlargement of these blood-filled cavities compresses the vessels that carry blood out of the penis, and the erectile tissue becomes engorged with blood.
7.42.3.2.2.7	The penis becomes hard and erect, facilitating its insertion into the vagina.
7.42.3.2.2.8	Many species of mammals (though not humans) have a bone in the penis, but these species still depend on erectile tissue for copulation.
7.42.3.2.3.1	At the climax of copulation, 2 to 6 milliliters of semen are propelled through the vasa deferentia and the urethra in two steps, emission and ejaculation.
7.42.3.2.3.2	During emission, rhythmic contractions of smooth muscles in the vasa deferentia and accessory glands move the semen into the urethra at the base of the penis.
7.42.3.2.3.3	Ejaculation is caused by contractions of other muscles at the base of the penis surrounding the urethra.
7.42.3.2.3.4	These contractions force the coagulum of semen through the urethra and out of the penis.
7.42.3.2.3.5	The muscle contractions of ejaculation are accompanied by feelings of intense pleasure known as orgasm.
7.42.3.2.3.6	They are also accompanied by transient increases in heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, pupil dilation, and skeletal muscle contractions throughout the body.
7.42.3.2.4.1	After ejaculation, NO release decreases and enzymes break down cGMP, causing the blood vessels flowing into the penis to constrict.
7.42.3.2.4.2	The blood pressure in the erectile tissue decreases, relieving the compression of the blood vessels leaving the penis, and the erection declines.
7.42.3.2.5.1	Erectile dysfunction (ED), or impotence, is the inability to achieve or sustain an erection.
7.42.3.2.5.2	ED may have different causes, including cardiovascular disease.
7.42.3.2.5.3	Drugs used to treat ED act by inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down cGMP, thus enhancing the effect of NO released in the penis, which improves the ability to achieve and maintain an erection.
7.42.3.3.1.1	Spermatogenesis and maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics such as facial hair and a deep voice depend on testosterone produced by the Leydig cells of the testes.
7.42.3.3.1.2	As described in Key Concept 40.3, increased production of testosterone at puberty results from an increased release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by the hypothalamus.
7.42.3.3.1.3	GnRH stimulates anterior pituitary cells to secrete luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (Figure 42.11).
7.42.3.3.1.4	Higher levels of LH stimulate the Leydig cells to increase their production and release of testosterone.
7.42.3.3.1.5	Testosterone exerts negative feedback on the anterior pituitary and the hypothalamus.
7.42.3.3.1.6	At the time of puberty, the sensitivity of the hypothalamus to negative feedback from testosterone declines; as a result, the level of circulating testosterone increases.
7.42.3.3.1.7	Figure 42.11 Male Reproductive Hormones
7.42.3.3.2.1	Increased testosterone in pubertal boys causes the development of pubic and facial hair, a deeper voice, enlarged genitals, and an increased growth rate.
7.42.3.3.2.2	Testosterone also promotes increased muscle mass and maturation of the testes.
7.42.3.3.2.3	Continued production of testosterone after puberty is essential for the maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics and the production of sperm.
7.42.3.3.3.1	Spermatogenesis is controlled by the influence of FSH and testosterone on the Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules.
7.42.3.3.3.2	The Sertoli cells also produce a hormone called inhibin that exerts negative feedback on the anterior pituitary cells producing and secreting FSH.
7.42.3.3.4.1	42.3 recap
7.42.3.3.5.1	Sperm are produced in the testes and are suspended in the seminal fluids produced by accessory glands.
7.42.3.3.5.2	The resulting semen is ejaculated into the female reproductive tract during copulation.
7.42.3.3.5.3	Prior to copulation, sexual stimulation causes the penis to become erect by increasing the blood flow into the erectile tissues.
7.42.3.3.5.4	The male reproductive system is under hormonal control by the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary, with negative feedback coming from hormones produced by the testes.

7.42.3.3.12.1	What makes ejaculated semen thick and gelatinous, and how do sperm escape the gel to move up the female reproductive tract?
7.42.3.3.13.1	What are the roles of Sertoli cells in spermatogenesis?
7.42.3.3.14.1	cGMP is broken down by an enzyme called a phosphodiesterase.
7.42.3.3.14.2	How does an inhibitor of that enzyme treat erectile dysfunction?
7.42.3.3.15.1	What is the significance of the fact that the testes of a prepubertal male are responsive to FSH and LH?
7.42.3.3.16.1	Whereas the male reproductive system produces sperm continuously throughout reproductive life, the female system produces eggs that can be fertilized by sperm periodically.
7.42.3.3.16.2	We now turn to the cyclical processes by which the female reproductive system produces and releases eggs and prepares the female reproductive tract to receive a developing embryo should fertilization occur.

7.42.4.2.1	The uterine cycle prepares an environment for a fertilized egg
7.42.4.3.1	Hormones control and coordinate the ovarian and uterine cycles
7.42.4.4.1	FSH receptors determine which follicle ovulates
7.42.4.5.1	In pregnancy, hormones from the extraembryonic membranes take over
7.42.4.6.1	Breast feeding delays the return of the ovarian cycle
7.42.4.7.1	Childbirth is triggered by hormonal and mechanical stimuli
7.42.4.8.1	Birth as well as reproduction is timed
7.42.4.9.1	Figure 42.12 illustrates the human female reproductive system.
7.42.4.9.2	Eggs are produced in and released from the ovaries located on each side of the lower abdominal cavity.
7.42.4.9.3	When an egg leaves the ovary (ovulation), it enters the abdominal cavity, but it does not go far.
7.42.4.9.4	The ovaries are close to the openings of the oviducts (also known as the Fallopian tubes).
7.42.4.9.5	The openings are surrounded by undulating, fringed tissues called fimbria that sweep the egg into the oviduct.
7.42.4.9.6	Cilia lining the oviduct propel the egg toward the uterus, a muscular, thick-walled cavity shaped in humans like an upside-down pear.
7.42.4.9.7	The uterus is where the embryo will develop if the egg is fertilized.
7.42.4.9.8	At its bottom, the uterus narrows into a region called the cervix, which opens into the vagina.

7.42.4.11.1	The menstrual (uterine) cycle refers to the buildup and breakdown of the endometrial lining of the uterus.
7.42.4.12.1	If pregnancy occurs, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulates the corpus luteum to continue producing estrogen and progesterone.
7.42.4.13.1	Mechanical and hormonal stimuli are involved in labor.
7.42.4.14.1	The ovarian and uterine cycles are coordinated and timed by the same hormones that initiate sexual maturation.
7.42.4.15.1	Externally, the vagina is enclosed by two sets of skin folds.
7.42.4.15.2	The inner, more delicate folds are the labia minora; the outer, thicker folds are the labia majora.
7.42.4.15.3	At the anterior tip of the labia minora is the clitoris, a small bulb of highly sensitive erectile tissue that has the same developmental origins as the male glans penis.
7.42.4.15.4	Clitoral tissues, homologous to the erectile tissues of the penis, extend deep under the labia minora and the walls of the vagina.
7.42.4.15.5	The labia minora and the clitoral tissues become engorged with blood in response to sexual stimulation.
7.42.4.15.6	Just as stimulation of the glans penis during sexual intercourse culminates in orgasm in the male, stimulation of the clitoral tissues results in orgasm in the female.
7.42.4.16.1	The external opening of an infant&#8217;s vagina is usually, but not always, partly covered by a thin membrane, the hymen.
7.42.4.16.2	Eventually the hymen can be torn by vigorous physical activity or by first sexual intercourse; it can sometimes make first intercourse difficult or painful for the woman.
7.42.4.17.1	Sperm deposited in the vagina swim and are propelled by contractions of the female reproductive tract through the cervical opening, across the uterus, and most of the way up an oviduct, where fertilization takes place.
7.42.4.17.2	Before meeting a sperm, the egg is still a secondary oocyte.
7.42.4.17.3	Fertilization stimulates the egg to complete its second meiotic division.
7.42.4.17.4	Following that division, the haploid nuclei of the sperm and the egg can fuse to produce a diploid zygote nucleus.
7.42.4.18.1	The *zygote undergoes its first few cell divisions to become a blastocyst while still in the oviduct.
7.42.4.18.2	The blastocyst moves down the oviduct to the uterus, where it attaches itself to the epithelial lining of the uterus&#8212;the endometrium.
7.42.4.18.3	Once attached, the blastocyst implants in the endometrium and interacts with it to form the placenta, as you will see in Chapter 42.
7.42.4.18.4	The mother&#8217;s body nurtures the embryo through the placenta, which also produces hormones that sustain pregnancy.
7.42.4.19.1	*connect the concepts The processes by which the zygote forms, develops into a blastocyst, and becomes implanted in the uterus are illustrated in Key Concept 44.2.
7.42.4.20.1	The maturation of eggs and ovulation are cyclical events in the ovaries.
7.42.4.20.2	Changes in the uterus are also critical processes.
7.42.4.20.3	These cycles in humans average about 28 days, but they can vary considerably in an individual and among different individuals.
7.42.4.20.4	In anticipation of receiving a blastocyst, the endometrium thickens and develops lots of blood vessels.
7.42.4.20.5	The endometrium regresses if a blastocyst does not arrive within a certain window of time.
7.42.4.20.6	Thus female reproductive functions consist of two linked cycles: an ovarian cycle that produces eggs and hormones; and a uterine, or menstrual, cycle that prepares the endometrium for the arrival of a blastocyst (Focus: Key Figure 42.13).
7.42.4.20.7	The two cycles must be synchronized so that a blastocyst arrives in the uterus at the optimal time to implant in the endometrium and continue its development.
7.42.4.21.1	focus: key figure
7.42.4.22.1	Figure 42.13 The Ovarian and Uterine Cycles
7.42.4.23.1	(A) The ovarian cycle progresses from the development of a follicle to ovulation and then to growth and finally to degeneration of the corpus luteum.
7.42.4.23.2	(B) During a woman&#8217;s ovarian and uterine cycles, coordinated changes occur in the development of the ovarian follicle, the release of female sex steroids, and the endometrial lining of the uterus.
7.42.4.23.3	The release of hypothalamic GnRH stimulates the release of pituitary LH and FSH which in turn control the development of the follicle and eventually ovulation.
7.42.4.23.4	The cycles begin with the onset of menstruation; ovulation is at midcycle (yellow bar).
7.42.4.23.5	(C) The ovarian and uterine cycles are under a complex series of positive and negative feedback controls involving several hormones.
7.42.4.24.1	Q: Hormonal contraceptive pills contain estrogen and progesterone, which portion of the ovarian cycle do they simulate and how do they prevent ovulation?
7.42.4.1.1.1	A newborn baby girl has about a million primary oocytes in each ovary.
7.42.4.1.1.2	By the time she reaches puberty, she has only about 200,000; the rest have degenerated.
7.42.4.1.1.3	During a woman&#8217;s fertile years, her ovaries go through about 450 ovarian cycles.
7.42.4.1.1.4	During each cycle, 10 to 20 primary oocytes begin to mature, but usually only one matures completely and is ovulated; the others degenerate (see Figure 42.13A).
7.42.4.1.1.5	At around the age of 50, a woman reaches menopause&#8212;the end of fertility&#8212;and may have few oocytes left in each ovary.
7.42.4.1.1.6	For more than 50 years, the gradual age-related decline in oocytes was taken as evidence that oogenesis in humans is limited to prenatal life.
7.42.4.1.1.7	However, in recent years oogonial stem cells (OSCs) have been isolated from adult ovaries of mice and of humans.
7.42.4.1.1.8	These OSCs have been shown to be capable of division and production of oocytes.
7.42.4.1.1.9	Thus menopause may not be the absolute end of fertility.
7.42.4.1.2.1	A primary oocyte surrounded by a layer of ovarian cells is the functional unit of the ovary&#8212;the follicle (see the photo in Figure 42.13A).
7.42.4.1.2.2	The follicle cells surrounding the oocyte supply it with nutrients and growth factors.
7.42.4.1.2.3	The follicle cells are also the main site of production of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone.
7.42.4.1.2.4	Usually only one follicle matures completely and reaches the stage of ovulation, releasing its egg at midcycle.
7.42.4.1.2.5	Events that lead up to and follow ovulation are illustrated in Figure 42.13B.
7.42.4.1.2.6	Follicle maturation occurs in the first half of the cycle, therefore called the follicular phase.
7.42.4.1.2.7	The midcycle point at which the follicle ruptures to release the oocyte is marked by a vertical yellow bar.
7.42.4.1.2.8	The notable hormonal event leading up to ovulation is the gradual and then escalating increase in estrogen, which peaks just prior to midcycle (see Figure 42.13B).
7.42.4.1.3.1	The second half of the ovarian cycle is called the luteal phase because the follicle cells left in the ovary after the egg is ovulated develop into an endocrine gland&#8212;the corpus luteum (yellow body)&#8212;secreting estrogen and progesterone.
7.42.4.1.3.2	If the egg is not fertilized and does not embed into the endometrium, the corpus luteum becomes inactive and degenerates in 12 to 14 days.
7.42.4.2.1.1	The uterine cycle parallels the ovarian cycle and consists of a buildup and then a breakdown of the endometrium (see Figure 42.13B).
7.42.4.2.1.2	The breakdown of the endometrium, or menstruation (Latin menses, &#8220;months&#8221;), marks the beginning of each uterine and ovarian cycle.
7.42.4.2.1.3	About 5 days after menstruation begins, the endometrium starts to thicken in preparation for receiving a blastocyst.
7.42.4.2.1.4	The uterus attains its maximal state of preparedness about 5 days after ovulation and remains in that state for another 9 days.
7.42.4.2.1.5	If a blastocyst has not arrived by that time, the endometrium breaks down and the sloughed-off tissue, including blood, flows from the body through the vagina as a menstrual discharge.
7.42.4.2.2.1	The uterine cycles of most mammals other than humans do not include menstruation; instead, the uterine lining typically is reabsorbed.
7.42.4.2.2.2	In these species, the most obvious correlate of the ovarian cycle is a state of sexual receptivity called estrus (&#8220;heat&#8221;) around the time of ovulation.
7.42.4.2.2.3	You may be aware of the bloody discharge that occurs in dogs at the time of estrus.
7.42.4.2.2.4	This discharge is not the same as menstruation&#8212;in fact it is exactly the opposite.
7.42.4.2.2.5	Bleeding in dogs occurs during the proliferation of the uterine lining, which occurs just before ovulation.
7.42.4.2.2.6	When the female mammal comes into estrus, she actively solicits male attention and may be aggressive to other females.
7.42.4.2.2.7	Humans are unusual among mammals in that females are potentially sexually receptive throughout their ovarian cycles and at all seasons of the year.
7.42.4.3.1.1	The ovarian and uterine cycles are coordinated and timed by the same hormones that initiate sexual maturation.
7.42.4.3.1.2	Gonadotropins (FSH and LH) secreted by the anterior pituitary are the central elements of this control (see Figure 42.13B).
7.42.4.3.1.3	Before puberty (i. e. , before about 11 years of age), the secretion of FSH and LH is low and the ovaries are inactive.
7.42.4.3.1.4	At puberty the hypothalamus increases its release of GnRH, stimulating the anterior pituitary to secrete FSH and LH.
7.42.4.3.1.5	In response to FSH and LH, ovarian tissue grows and produces estrogen.
7.42.4.3.1.6	The rise in estrogen causes the maturation of the accessory sex organs and the development of female secondary sexual characteristics.
7.42.4.3.1.7	Between puberty and menopause, interactions of GnRH, gonadotropins, and sex steroids control the ovarian and uterine cycles.
7.42.4.3.2.1	A few days before menstruation begins, the anterior pituitary begins to increase its secretion of FSH and LH.
7.42.4.3.2.2	In response, several follicles begin to mature in the ovaries, and these follicles steadily increase their production of estrogen.
7.42.4.3.2.3	After about a week, all but one of the follicles wither away.
7.42.4.3.3.1	For the first 12 days of a 28-day ovarian cycle, estrogen exerts positive rather than negative feedback control on the pituitary.
7.42.4.3.3.2	As a result, a surge of LH and a lesser surge of FSH occur (see Figure 42.13B).
7.42.4.3.3.3	The LH surge triggers the mature follicle to rupture and release its egg, and it stimulates the cells of the ruptured follicle to develop into a corpus luteum.
7.42.4.3.4.1	Estrogen and progesterone secreted by the corpus luteum following ovulation are crucial to growth and maintenance of the endometrium.
7.42.4.3.4.2	These sex steroids also exert negative feedback control on the pituitary, inhibiting gonadotropin release and thus preventing new follicles from maturing.
7.42.4.3.5.1	If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum degenerates on about day 26 of the cycle.
7.42.4.3.5.2	Without production of progesterone by the corpus luteum, the endometrium sloughs off and menstruation occurs.
7.42.4.3.5.3	The decrease in circulating steroids also releases the hypothalamus and pituitary from negative feedback control, so GnRH, FSH, and LH all begin to increase.
7.42.4.3.5.4	The increase in these hormones induces the next round of follicle development, and the ovarian cycle begins again.
7.42.4.4.1.1	Early in the ovarian cycle several follicles begin to develop, but only one reaches full maturity.
7.42.4.4.1.2	What determines which one will survive?
7.42.4.4.1.3	There are two types of follicle cells, arranged in two layers.
7.42.4.4.1.4	The inner layer immediately surrounding the ovum is made up of granulosa cells, and the outer layer consists of thecal cells.
7.42.4.4.1.5	Thecal cells are stimulated by LH to produce testosterone (similar to Leydig cells in the male).
7.42.4.4.1.6	Testosterone diffuses into the granulosa cells, where the enzyme aromatase converts the testosterone to estrogen.
7.42.4.4.1.7	Estrogen, along with FSH, stimulates the growth and maturation of the granulosa cells (similar to the Sertoli cells in the male).
7.42.4.4.1.8	The estrogen plays two important roles in the selection of the follicle that will ovulate: (1) estrogen stimulates the granulosa cells to express more FSH and LH receptors, and (2) estrogen entering the circulation feeds back on the pituitary to decrease the production of FSH.
7.42.4.4.1.9	The granulosa cells also produce inhibin (similar to Sertoli cells in the male), and inhibin also decreases the production of FSH.
7.42.4.4.1.10	As FSH and LH levels fall, the follicle with the most FSH and LH receptors survives and matures while the others regress.
7.42.4.5.1.1	If the egg is fertilized and a blastocyst arrives in the uterus and implants in the endometrium, a new hormone comes into play.
7.42.4.5.1.2	A layer of cells covering the blastocyst begins to secrete human chorionic gonadotropin, or hCG (Figure 42.14).
7.42.4.5.1.3	This gonadotropin, a molecule similar to LH, stimulates the corpus luteum to continue to produce estrogen and progesterone to support the growth and maintenance of the endometrium and thereby prevent menstruation.
7.42.4.5.1.4	Because it is present only in the blood of pregnant women, the presence of hCG is the basis for pregnancy testing.
7.42.4.5.1.5	Pregnancy tests use an antibody to detect hCG in urine; they take only minutes and can be done at home.
7.42.4.5.2.1	Figure 42.14 Pregnancy and Childbirth When a fertilized ovum implants in the uterus, cells surrounding it produce human chorionic gonadotropin, which acts like LH and keeps the corpus luteum functioning as an endocrine gland.
7.42.4.5.2.2	The ovarian and uterine cycles are put on hold for the duration of pregnancy.
7.42.4.5.3.1	Blastocyst and endometrial tissues form the placenta, which nourishes the embryo.
7.42.4.5.3.2	The placenta also replaces the corpus luteum as the major producer of estrogen and progesterone.
7.42.4.5.3.3	Continued high levels of estrogen and progesterone prevent the pituitary from secreting gonadotropins; thus the ovarian cycle ceases for the duration of pregnancy.
7.42.4.5.3.4	This mechanism underlies the action of birth control pills, which contain synthetic hormones resembling estrogen and progesterone that exert negative feedback control on the hypothalamus and pituitary.
7.42.4.6.1.1	Following birth, estrogen and progesterone levels drop because of the loss of the placenta, and therefore negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary imposed by these hormones during pregnancy is gone.
7.42.4.6.1.2	Nevertheless, women who breast feed their infants may not have their ovarian and menstrual cycles return for some time&#8212;a phenomenon called lactational delay.
7.42.4.6.1.3	In Figure 40.4 you learned that the pituitary hormone prolactin stimulates the growth of the mammary glands and the production of milk.
7.42.4.6.1.4	Prolactin release is stimulated by the suckling of the infant.
7.42.4.6.1.5	Even the sight or sound of the infant can stimulate prolactin release in the mother.
7.42.4.6.1.6	Investigations have now shown that in addition to stimulating the mammary glands, prolactin also inhibits GnRH release and LH release, possibly explaining lactational delay.
7.42.4.6.1.7	Going back to the case of the tammar wallaby in the opening to this chapter, could prolactin release stimulated by the suckling of the joey in the pouch be responsible for the delayed implantation seen in this species?
7.42.4.6.1.8	Investigating Life: The Control of Diapause in the Tammar Wallaby examines this question.

7.42.4.6.5.3	Reproduction, Fertility, and Development 25: 456   461.
7.42.4.6.6.1	In Chapter 40 (see Figure 40.4) we discussed how the hormone prolactin (PRL) has evolved to serve many physiological processes in different vertebrate groups, but these various processes all have some connection to reproduction.
7.42.4.6.6.2	Since prolactin is involved in controlling lactation in mammals, could prolactin be the signal in the tammar wallaby that maintains embryonic diapause as long as suckling continues?
7.42.4.6.7.1	HYPOTHESIS Pulses of prolactin in lactating female tammar wallabies prevent new embryos from developing as long as previous offspring are suckling.
7.42.4.6.8.1	METHOD
7.42.4.6.9.1	The hormone progesterone (P) prepares the uterine lining for implantation of an embryo and maintains the uterine lining during pregnancy.
7.42.4.6.9.2	Thus measurements of blood levels of P reveal when diapause is broken in tammar wallabies.
7.42.4.6.9.3	A stimulus known to break diapause in these animals is the removal of the prior young from the pouch (RYP).
7.42.4.6.9.4	The RYP method was used to study the effects of prolactin on maintenance of diapause.
7.42.4.6.10.1	Remove young from the pouches of three groups of five wallabies.
7.42.4.6.11.1	Following RYP administer the following treatments:
7.42.4.6.12.1	Group A: saline injection for 8 days following RYP (controls)
7.42.4.6.13.1	Group B: PRL injection every 24 hr for 8 days following RYP
7.42.4.6.14.1	Group C: PRL injection every 48 hr for 8 days following RYP
7.42.4.6.15.1	Take daily blood samples to measure P levels.
7.42.4.6.16.1	RESULTS
7.42.4.6.17.1	Data are approximate means of the actual measurements, progesterone concentrations (P) expressed in picograms per milliliter (pg/mL).

7.42.4.6.19.1	CONCLUSION When tammar wallabies were treated with daily saline injections (controls), they broke diapause 4 to 5 days following RYP.
7.42.4.6.19.2	However, when they were treated with daily PRL injections, they broke diapause 11 or 12 days following RYP.
7.42.4.6.19.3	Hence daily PRL pulses can prolong diapause and delay implantation of a new blastocyst.
7.42.4.6.20.1	work with the data
7.42.4.6.21.1	Following the experiment showing that daily pulses of PRL can maintain diapause, the investigators asked whether pulses of PRL every 2 days could maintain diapause.
7.42.4.6.21.2	The data are shown in the table as Group C. Plotting the data will show if there is a difference in the response to PRL when pulses were given every other day following RYP.
7.42.4.6.22.1	QUESTIONS
7.42.4.6.23.1	Plot the data as was done for Groups A and B. Was the 48-hr PRL pulse effective in preventing the breaking of diapause?
7.42.4.6.24.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.42.4.7.1.1	Throughout pregnancy, the muscles of the uterine wall periodically undergo slow, weak, rhythmic contractions called Braxton Hicks contractions.
7.42.4.7.1.2	These contractions become stronger during the third trimester of pregnancy and are sometimes called false labor.
7.42.4.7.1.3	The contractions of true labor mark the beginning of childbirth.
7.42.4.7.1.4	Both hormonal and mechanical stimuli contribute to the onset of labor (Figure 42.15A).
7.42.4.7.1.5	Figure 42.15 Labor and Delivery
7.42.4.7.2.1	Progesterone inhibits and estrogen stimulates contractions of uterine muscle.
7.42.4.7.2.2	Toward the end of the third trimester, the estrogen   progesterone ratio shifts in favor of estrogen.
7.42.4.7.2.3	The onset of labor is marked by increased secretion of the hormone oxytocin by the posterior pituitaries of both mother and fetus.
7.42.4.7.2.4	Oxytocin is a powerful stimulant of uterine muscle contraction.
7.42.4.7.2.5	Manufactured oxytocin is used to induce labor when that is necessary.
7.42.4.7.3.1	Mechanical stimuli come from the stretching of the uterus by the fully grown fetus and the pressure of the fetal head on the cervix.
7.42.4.7.3.2	These mechanical stimuli increase the release of oxytocin by the mother&#8217;s posterior pituitary, which in turn increases the activity of uterine muscle, causing even more pressure on the cervix.
7.42.4.7.3.3	This positive feedback loop converts the weak, slow, rhythmic Braxton Hicks contractions into stronger labor contractions.
7.42.4.7.4.1	In the early stage of labor, hormonal changes and pressure created by the contractions cause the cervix to dilate (expand) until it is large enough to allow the baby to pass through.
7.42.4.7.4.2	Gradually the contractions become more frequent and more intense.
7.42.4.7.4.3	This stage of labor lasts an average of 12 to 15 hours in a first pregnancy, but is usually 8 hours or less in subsequent ones.
7.42.4.7.5.1	The second stage of labor begins when the cervix is fully dilated to a diameter of about 10 cm (Figure 42.15B).
7.42.4.7.5.2	The baby&#8217;s head can now move into the vagina.
7.42.4.7.5.3	Passage of the fetus through the vagina is assisted by the mother&#8217;s bearing down (&#8220;pushing&#8221;) with her abdominal and other muscles.
7.42.4.7.5.4	Once the head and shoulders of the baby clear the cervix, the rest of its body eases out rapidly, but it is still connected to the placenta by the umbilical cord.
7.42.4.7.5.5	Once the baby clears the birth canal, it starts breathing and is independent of its mother&#8217;s circulation.
7.42.4.7.5.6	The umbilical cord may then be clamped and cut.
7.42.4.7.5.7	The segment still attached to the baby dries up and sloughs off in a few days, leaving behind its distinctive signature, the belly button&#8212;more properly called the umbilicus.
7.42.4.7.5.8	The third stage of labor, the detachment and expulsion of the placenta and fetal membranes, takes from a few minutes to an hour, and may be accompanied by uterine contractions.
7.42.4.7.5.9	A baby&#8217;s suckling at the breast immediately following birth stimulates additional secretion of oxytocin, which augments uterine contractions, reduces the size of the uterus, and helps stop bleeding.
7.42.4.8.1.1	Reproduction in many species is seasonal.
7.42.4.8.1.2	This seasonality in many species of vertebrates involves mechanisms of photoperiodism.
7.42.4.8.1.3	Briefly, changes in day length enable animals to anticipate the best time of year for the rearing of young and therefore time their reproduction and birth accordingly.
7.42.4.8.1.4	How do animals measure day length?
7.42.4.8.1.5	As we will discuss in more detail in Chapter 52, animals have endogenous daily rhythms called circadian (circa, &#8220;day,&#8221; &#0043; dia, &#8220;length&#8221;) rhythms.
7.42.4.8.1.6	As day length changes, sunrise and sunset occur at different phases of the circadian rhythm.
7.42.4.8.1.7	The release of melatonin from the pineal gland is controlled by the circadian rhythm but is inhibited by light.
7.42.4.8.1.8	Therefore as days get longer, the nightly pulse of melatonin gets shorter, and conversely as days get shorter, the melatonin pulse gets longer.
7.42.4.8.1.9	Day length determines when many species come into reproductive condition and mate.
7.42.4.8.1.10	That is not true for the tammar wallaby that was introduced at the beginning of this chapter.
7.42.4.8.1.11	The wallaby mates at any time of year soon after it gives birth.
7.42.4.8.1.12	However, diapause in the wallaby is sensitive to night length&#8212;that is, to the duration of the melatonin pulse.
7.42.4.8.1.13	A non-lactating wallaby will break diapause when night length reaches 12 hr.
7.42.4.8.1.14	Similarly, when non-lactating wallabies are held at a night length of 9 hr but given melatonin injections 2.5 hr before sunset, they break diapause.
7.42.4.8.1.15	These results support the hypothesis that short daily melatonin pulses prolong diapause and that long daily melatonin pulses are a signal to break diapause.
7.42.4.8.1.16	The significance for the nocturnal wallaby is that birth tends to be at the time of year when nights are longest.
7.42.4.8.2.1	Humans are not seasonal breeders, but there is a timing component of childbirth.
7.42.4.8.2.2	Most women go into labor at night.
7.42.4.8.2.3	However, it is quite common for labor to cease when women arrive in the brightly lit hospital.
7.42.4.8.2.4	Bright light interrupts the nightly melatonin pulse in humans.
7.42.4.8.2.5	The work with the data exercise (Circadian Timing, Hormone Release, and Labor) explores whether melatonin is involved in the timing of human births.
7.42.4.8.3.1	42.4 recap
7.42.4.8.4.1	The reproductive system of women produces oocytes (eggs) and hormones, and these functions are controlled by hypothalamic and anterior pituitary hormones.
7.42.4.8.4.2	The follicle is the functional unit of the ovary.
7.42.4.8.4.3	Usually one follicle matures and ovulates each month as controlled by a cyclical feedback interplay between ovarian hormones and the hypothalamic   pituitary axis.
7.42.4.8.4.4	These hormonal cycles also coordinate the uterine, or menstrual, cycle so that the endometrium is prepared to receive a blastocyst should fertilization occur.
7.42.4.8.4.5	A blastocyst implanted in the uterus produces hCG, which suspends the ovarian and uterine cycles by sustaining the ovarian production of progesterone and estrogen until the placenta can take over this function.
7.42.4.8.4.6	Childbirth and lactation are controlled by mechanical and hormonal mechanisms.
7.42.4.8.5.1	learning outcomes
7.42.4.8.6.1	You should be able to:
7.42.4.8.7.1	Link the events in the ovarian and menstrual cycles.
7.42.4.8.8.1	Describe the interaction between the granulosa cells and the thecal cells of the follicle in limiting the number of eggs that are ovulated in each cycle.
7.42.4.8.9.1	Explain how the blastocyst prevents menstruation.
7.42.4.8.10.1	Explain how mechanical and hormonal stimuli interact during labor.
7.42.4.8.11.1	What events in the ovary are responsible for the onset of menses, and what prevents menses if pregnancy occurs?
7.42.4.8.12.1	What are the roles of thecal cells and granulosa cells in the ovarian cycle, and how do they limit the number of eggs that are ovulated?
7.42.4.8.13.1	How does positive feedback between hormonal and mechanical processes play a role in childbirth?
7.42.4.8.14.1	Understanding the physiology of human reproduction has led to numerous methods and technologies for controlling it, either to prevent unwanted pregnancies or to overcome infertility.
7.42.4.8.15.1	Chapter 42 continues with
7.42.4.8.16.1	42.5 Fertility Can Be Controlled
7.42.5.1.1	Humans use a variety of methods to control fertility
7.42.5.2.1	Reproductive technologies help solve problems of infertility
7.42.5.3.1	Sexual issues and sexual behavior are dominant aspects of our society, and reproductive technologies have had huge impacts on our sexual and reproductive lives.
7.42.5.4.1	focus your learning
7.42.5.5.1	Birth control techniques are designed to prevent fertilization and/or implantation.
7.42.5.6.1	Assisted reproductive technologies enable couples who are infertile to have children.
7.42.5.1.1.1	According to a recent study, almost half of the more than 6 million pregnancies that occur in the United States each year are unintended.
7.42.5.1.1.2	For women of college age, a single act of unprotected intercourse in the 2 days prior to ovulation carries a chance of conception as high as 50 percent.
7.42.5.1.2.1	The only failure-proof methods of preventing pregnancy are either complete abstinence from sexual activity or surgical removal of the gonads.
7.42.5.1.2.2	Those options are not acceptable to most people, and they turn to other methods to prevent pregnancy.
7.42.5.1.2.3	Many of these methods prevent fertilization or implantation (conception) and are therefore referred to as contraception.
7.42.5.1.2.4	Table 42.1 lists some of the most commonly used contraceptive methods and their relative failure rates; note that these methods vary enormously in their effectiveness.
7.42.5.1.2.5	Most methods are used by the woman, although some are used by the man.
7.42.5.1.3.1	table 42.1 Methods of Contraception Method Mode of action Failure ratea Comments Unprotected No form of birth control. 85 High risk of pregnancy, especially for women 15   30.
7.42.5.1.3.2	Nontechnological methods Rhythm method The couple abstains from intercourse between days 10 and 20 of the ovarian cycle (peak fertility). 15   35 High failure rate due to miscalculation and/or variation of individual cycles.
7.42.5.1.3.3	Coitus interruptus The man withdraws his penis prior to ejaculation with the intention of not depositing sperm into the vagina. 20   40 Requires self-control, especially by the man.
7.42.5.1.3.4	Very high failure rate.
7.42.5.1.3.5	Barrier methodsb Condom (male or female) A sheath of impermeable material (often latex) is fitted over the erect penis or into the vagina.
7.42.5.1.3.6	Semen is trapped in the condom, so no sperm are deposited in the vagina. 3   20 If fitted correctly, an intact condom can prevent pregnancy.
7.42.5.1.3.7	Failure can be due to material failure or improper use.
7.42.5.1.3.8	Condoms are the only contraceptive method that protects against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV (AIDS).
7.42.5.1.3.9	Spermicidal jellies Applied deep inside the vagina, these chemical compounds kill or immobilize sperm. 25 Used alone, spermicidal compounds have a high failure rate.
7.42.5.1.3.10	Diaphragms, cervical caps, cervical sponges containing spermacide Inserted by the woman prior to intercourse, these devices work by blocking the cervix so that sperm cannot pass into the uterus. 15   30 Approximately the same failure rate as condom use by men, but do not protect against STDs.
7.42.5.1.3.11	Can be used in conjunction with spermicidal jelly for extra protection.
7.42.5.1.3.12	Hormone-based contraceptives Oral hormones (&#8220;the pill&#8221;) A daily pill for women containing a combination of synthetic estrogens and progesterone.
7.42.5.1.3.13	These hormones mimic pregnancy to the extent that the ovarian cycle and ovulation are suspended.
7.42.5.1.3.14	The uterine cycle can continue by including a week of non-hormone administration every 21   28 days. 0   3 Requires medical consultation and prescription.
7.42.5.1.3.15	Taken correctly, oral contraceptives are extremely effective.
7.42.5.1.3.16	In the United States, more than 12 million women use them each year; they are sometimes prescribed to treat menstrual disorders.
7.42.5.1.3.17	Non-orally administered hormones Making use of same hormonal actions as the pill, these methods include long-acting injections, patches that release hormones transdermally (through the skin), and a hormone-containing vaginal ring.
7.42.5.1.3.18	Implantable progestin releasing have a failure rate of &lt;1 and can last up to 3 years. &lt;5 Same as oral hormones.
7.42.5.1.3.19	A slightly lower failure rate because the woman does not have to remember to take a daily pill.
7.42.5.1.3.20	Progestin-only pill (Plan Bb) An oral contraceptive meant to be taken within 72 hours after unprotected sex.
7.42.5.1.3.21	A high dose of progestin in two pills prevents ovulation in the same manner birth control pills do. 5   40 Not an &#8220;abortion pill,&#8221; this drug will not terminate an existing pregnancy.
7.42.5.1.3.22	Currently available to women over 17 without a prescription.
7.42.5.1.3.23	Failure rate varies widely depending on when taken.
7.42.5.1.3.24	Implantation blockers Intrauterine device (IUD) A medical professional inserts a small plastic or metal device into the uterus.
7.42.5.1.3.25	The resulting inflammation reaction (see Chapter 40) releases prostaglandins, which prevent implantation of the fertilized egg. &lt;1 A highly effective contraceptive, it is the most widely used birth control device in China (and hence the world).
7.42.5.1.3.26	With medical monitoring, can remain in place for several years.
7.42.5.1.3.27	Contragestational pill Mifepristone or RU-486 is a drug that blocks the action of progesterone that is necessary to maintain the endometrium during implantation and pregnancy. 0.5   6 Prevents implantation when taken up to several days after unprotected intercourse.
7.42.5.1.3.28	Can terminate a pregnancy up to the time of the first missed menstrual period.
7.42.5.1.3.29	In the United States, available from specialized providers.
7.42.5.1.3.30	Sterilization Vasectomy The vasa deferentia (see Figure 42.9) are cut and tied off so that sperm can no longer pass into the urethra.
7.42.5.1.3.31	Sperm continue to be produced but are reabsorbed by the man&#8217;s body.
7.42.5.1.3.32	Male hormone levels and sexual responses are not affected. 0   0.15 A simple surgical procedure performed under local anesthetic in a doctor&#8217;s office.
7.42.5.1.3.33	Although theoretically it can be reversed, vasectomy should be considered permanent.
7.42.5.1.3.34	Tubal ligation The oviducts (see Figure 42.12A) are tied off so that eggs cannot reach the uterus and sperm cannot reach the egg.
7.42.5.1.3.35	As with vasectomy, hormone levels and sexual responses are not affected. 0   0.05 This surgical procedure is somewhat more complex than vasectomy.
7.42.5.1.3.36	It is often performed in conjunction with childbirth when a woman has decided that her family is complete.
7.42.5.1.4.1	aFailure rate refers to the number of pregnancies per 100 women per year.
7.42.5.1.5.1	bAll of these barrier methods are routinely available without medical prescription.
7.42.5.1.6.1	Once a fertilized egg is successfully implanted in the uterus, any termination of the pregnancy is called an abortion.
7.42.5.1.6.2	A spontaneous abortion is the medical term for what is commonly called a miscarriage.
7.42.5.1.6.3	Spontaneous abortions frequently occur early in pregnancy and are usually the result of either a chromosomal abnormality in the fetus or a breakdown in the process of implantation.
7.42.5.1.6.4	Many spontaneous abortions occur before the woman even realizes she is pregnant.
7.42.5.1.7.1	Abortions that result from medical intervention may be performed either for therapeutic purposes or for fertility control.
7.42.5.1.7.2	A therapeutic abortion may be necessary to protect the health of the mother, or it may be performed because prenatal testing reveals that the fetus has a severe defect.
7.42.5.1.7.3	In a medical abortion, the cervix is dilated and some of the endometrium, along with the implanted fetus, is removed.
7.42.5.1.7.4	When performed in the first trimester of a pregnancy, a medical abortion carries less risk of death to the mother than a full-term pregnancy.
7.42.5.1.7.5	The risk rises after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy but remains less than that of a full-term pregnancy through the second trimester.
7.42.5.2.1.1	About 15 percent of couples in the United States are infertile&#8212;that is, they can&#8217;t have children.
7.42.5.2.1.2	The reasons for infertility are many, and are about equally distributed between men and women.
7.42.5.2.1.3	Several technologies have been developed to overcome barriers to both conceiving and bearing a child.
7.42.5.2.1.4	The simplest of these is artificial insemination, in which the physician places sperm in the woman&#8217;s reproductive tract.
7.42.5.2.1.5	This technique is useful if the male&#8217;s sperm count is low, if his sperm lack motility, or if problems in the female&#8217;s reproductive tract prevent the normal movement of sperm up the oviducts.
7.42.5.2.1.6	Artificial insemination is also widely used in the production of domesticated animals such as cattle.
7.42.5.2.2.1	Assisted reproductive technologies, or ARTs, involve procedures that remove unfertilized eggs from the ovary, combine them with sperm outside the body, and then place fertilized eggs or egg   sperm mixtures in the appropriate location in the woman&#8217;s reproductive tract for development to take place.
7.42.5.2.2.2	The first successful ART was in vitro fertilization (IVF).
7.42.5.2.2.3	In IVF the woman is treated with hormones that stimulate many follicles in her ovaries to mature.
7.42.5.2.2.4	Eggs are collected from these follicles, and sperm are collected from the intended father.
7.42.5.2.2.5	Eggs and sperm are combined in a culture medium outside the body, where fertilization takes place.
7.42.5.2.2.6	The resulting embryos can be injected into the mother&#8217;s uterus in the blastocyst stage or kept frozen for implantation later.
7.42.5.2.2.7	The first &#8220;test tube baby&#8221; resulting from IVF was born in England in 1978.
7.42.5.2.2.8	Since then, millions of babies have resulted from this ART.
7.42.5.2.3.1	A major cause of IVF failure is failure of sperm to gain access to the egg cell membrane (see Figure 42.5).
7.42.5.2.3.2	To solve this problem, methods have been developed to inject a sperm cell directly into the cytoplasm of an egg.
7.42.5.2.3.3	In intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), an egg is held in place by suction applied through a polished glass pipette.
7.42.5.2.3.4	A slender, sharp pipette is then used to penetrate the egg and inject a sperm (Figure 42.16).
7.42.5.2.3.5	This ART was used successfully for the first time in 1992 by researchers in Belgium; now thousands of these procedures are performed in U.S. clinics each year, with a success rate of about 25 percent.
7.42.5.2.3.6	Figure 42.16 Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection
7.42.5.2.4.1	IVF, coupled with techniques of genetic analysis, can eliminate the risk that adults who are carriers of genetic diseases will produce affected children.
7.42.5.2.4.2	It is now possible to take a cell from a human embryo at the 4- or 8-cell stage (see Figure 43.3) without damaging its developmental potential.
7.42.5.2.4.3	The sampled cell can be subjected to molecular analysis to determine whether it carries the harmful gene.
7.42.5.2.4.4	This procedure, called preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), makes it possible to determine whether an embryo produced by IVF carries the genetic defect of concern.
7.42.5.2.5.1	42.5 recap
7.42.5.2.6.1	Controlling fertility is an important aspect of modern human life.
7.42.5.2.6.2	Decreasing the probability of pregnancy is achieved through methods that prevent sperm and egg from meeting and from preventing implantation.
7.42.5.2.6.3	Pregnancies can be facilitated through technologies that extract eggs from the ovary and fertilize them in vitro before reintroducing them into the female reproductive tract.
7.42.5.2.7.1	learning outcomes
7.42.5.2.8.1	You should be able to:
7.42.5.2.9.1	Describe the relative advantages and disadvantages of different contraceptive methods.
7.42.5.2.10.1	Compare contraception and contragestational techniques.
7.42.5.2.11.1	Explain how procedures that use genetic analysis and in vitro fertilization (IVF) can help carriers of genetic disease avoid producing afflicted children.
7.42.5.2.12.1	Which method of contraception is the only one to offer protection against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?
7.42.5.2.12.2	Explain your answer.
7.42.5.2.13.1	Both the contraceptive pill (&#8220;the pill&#8221;) and the contragestational pill (RU-486) involve progesterone signaling.
7.42.5.2.13.2	How do their mechanisms of action differ?
7.42.5.2.14.1	How can IVF be used to prevent transmission of a genetic disease?
7.42.5.2.15.1	The fertilized egg of a sexually reproducing organism is a single cell containing all the genetic information needed to create a new organism.
7.42.5.2.15.2	Chapter 19 introduced some of the molecular aspects of the process of development in multicellular animals.
7.42.5.2.15.3	Chapter 43 will describe the physiological and anatomical events of animal development.
7.42.5.2.16.1	investigatinglife
7.42.5.2.17.1	What signal controls the breaking of diapause in the tammar wallaby?
7.42.5.2.18.1	The experiment presented in Investigating Life: The Control of Diapause in the Tammar Wallaby exploited the fact that removal of the young joey from the pouch of its mother (RYP) stimulated the blastocyst in her uterus to break diapause, implant, and continue development.
7.42.5.2.18.2	What diapause-breaking signal might be involved in conjunction with RYP?
7.42.5.2.18.3	Researchers hypothesized that RYP resulted in cessation of prolactin release stimulated by suckling of the young, and that the absence of those prolactin pulses initiated the breaking of diapause.
7.42.5.2.18.4	The test of that hypothesis was to apply RYP to groups of mother wallabies and test whether applications of prolactin could prevent the breaking of diapause.
7.42.5.2.18.5	The results showed that injections of prolactin every 24 hr for 8 days following RYP delayed the progesterone rise that indicates the breaking of diapause.
7.42.5.2.18.6	Prolactin injections at 48-hr or longer intervals were less effective or ineffective in maintaining diapause.
7.42.5.2.18.7	The conclusion was thus reached that prolactin pulses stimulated by suckling are a signal for the maintenance of diapause, and that the removal of that signal results in the breaking of diapause.
7.42.5.2.18.8	Another signal, melatonin, could be involved in the breaking of diapause.
7.42.5.2.18.9	The prolactin experiments were all done at the time of year when night length was appropriate for the breaking of diapause.
7.42.5.2.19.1	Future directions
7.42.5.2.20.1	Reproductive success depends on many factors, including ecological, physiological, and socio-behavioral factors.
7.42.5.2.20.2	It is therefore not surprising that evolutionary adaptations have exploited many kinds of information to control the timing of reproduction in various species.
7.42.5.2.20.3	While these controlling factors are diverse, in vertebrates they all work through the hypothalamic, pituitary, and gonadal regulatory mechanisms.
7.42.5.2.20.4	Therefore whatever we can learn about the physiology of reproduction in one vertebrate species may also apply to other species, or at least inform us as to what questions we should ask of other species, including humans.
7.42.5.2.20.5	The answers to these questions can help us preserve endangered species, improve domesticated species, solve reproductive problems in humans, and even help control human population growth.

7.42.5.2.22.1	Chapter Summary
7.42.summary.1.1	42.1 Asexual Reproduction Is Efficient but Limits Genetic Variability
7.42.summary.2.1	Asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to their parent and to one another; it produces no genetic diversity.
7.42.summary.3.1	Means of asexual reproduction include budding, regeneration, and parthenogenesis.
7.42.summary.3.2	Review Figures 42.1   42.3
7.42.summary.4.1	42.2 Sexual Reproduction Involves Union of Haploid Egg and Sperm
7.42.summary.5.1	Sexual reproduction involves three basic steps: gametogenesis, spawning or mating, and fertilization.
7.42.summary.6.1	Gametogenesis and fertilization are similar in all animals, but spawning and mating include a great variety of anatomical, physiological, and behavioral adaptations.
7.42.summary.7.1	Gametogenesis occurs in testes and ovaries.
7.42.summary.7.2	In spermatogenesis (the production of sperm) and oogenesis (the production of eggs), the germ cells proliferate mitotically, undergo meiosis, and mature into gametes.
7.42.summary.8.1	Each primary spermatocyte can produce four haploid sperm through the two divisions of meiosis.
7.42.summary.8.2	Review Figure 42.4A
7.42.summary.9.1	Primary oocytes immediately enter prophase of the first meiotic division, and in many species, including humans, their development is arrested at this point.
7.42.summary.9.2	Each oogonium produces only one egg.
7.42.summary.9.3	Review Figure 42.4B
7.42.summary.10.1	Fertilization involves sperm activation, species-specific binding of sperm to egg, the acrosomal reaction, digestion of a path through the protective coverings of the egg, and fusion of sperm and egg cell membranes.
7.42.summary.10.2	Fusion of these two membranes triggers blocks to polyspermy, which prevent additional sperm from entering the egg and, in mammals, signal the egg to complete meiosis and begin development.
7.42.summary.10.3	Review Figure 42.5, Animation 42.1
7.42.summary.11.1	External fertilization is common in aquatic species.
7.42.summary.11.2	Internal fertilization is necessary in terrestrial species and usually involves copulation.
7.42.summary.12.1	Hermaphroditic, or monoecious, species have both male and female reproductive systems in the same individual, either sequentially or simultaneously.
7.42.summary.12.2	Dioecious species have separate male and female individuals.
7.42.summary.13.1	Animals can be classified as oviparous or viviparous, depending on whether the early stages of development occur outside or inside the mother&#8217;s body.
7.42.summary.14.1	42.3 Male Sex Organs Produce and May Deliver Sperm
7.42.summary.15.1	Males produce semen consisting of sperm suspended in seminal fluid (which nourishes the sperm and facilitates fertilization).
7.42.summary.16.1	Sperm are generated in the seminiferous tubules of the testes, mature in the epididymis, and are delivered to the urethra through the vasa deferentia.
7.42.summary.16.2	Other components of semen are produced in the seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and bulbourethral glands.
7.42.summary.16.3	Review Figure 42.9, Activities 42.1, 42.2
7.42.summary.17.1	All components of the semen join in the urethra at the base of the penis and are ejaculated through the erect penis by muscle contractions at the climax of copulation.
7.42.summary.18.1	Spermatogenesis depends on testosterone secreted by the Leydig cells of the testes, which are under the control of hormones produced in the anterior pituitary and the hypothalamus.
7.42.summary.18.2	The production of these hormones is controlled by negative feedback from testosterone and from inhibin, a hormone produced by the Sertoli cells of the testes.
7.42.summary.18.3	Review Figures 42.10, 42.11
7.42.summary.19.1	42.4 Female Sex Organs Produce Eggs and Nurture Embryos
7.42.summary.20.1	Primary oocytes in the ovary are surrounded by granulosa and thecal cells that make up a follicle.
7.42.summary.20.2	Each month a small number of follicles respond to pituitary FSH by growing, producing estrogen, and promoting development of the oocyte.
7.42.summary.21.1	Usually in each cycle only one follicle fully matures and releases its oocyte, which is picked up by the opening of the oviducts.
7.42.summary.21.2	Sperm deposited in the vagina during copulation move up through the cervix and uterus into the oviducts.
7.42.summary.21.3	Fertilization occurs in the upper regions of the oviducts.
7.42.summary.21.4	Review Figure 42.12, Activity 42.3
7.42.summary.22.1	The maturation and release of eggs constitute an ovarian cycle.
7.42.summary.22.2	The uterine, or menstrual, cycle prepares the uterus for receipt of a blastocyst.
7.42.summary.22.3	If no blastocyst is implanted, the lining of the uterus sloughs off in the process of menstruation.
7.42.summary.22.4	Review Focus: Key Figure 42.13, Animation 42.2
7.42.summary.23.1	Both the ovarian and the uterine cycles are under the control of hypothalamic and pituitary hormones, which in turn are under the feedback control of estrogen and progesterone.

7.42.summary.32.3	Reproduction 128: 629   634.
7.42.summary.33.1	Many female mammals, including humans, are spontaneous ovulators, meaning they ovulate in a cyclical pattern; the release of eggs requires no external stimulus.
7.42.summary.33.2	Other female mammals, including camels, rabbits, and koalas, are reflex ovulators; in these females, sexual activity induces ovulation.
7.42.summary.33.3	The females come into estrus but do not ovulate and progress to the luteal phase unless copulation occurs.
7.42.summary.33.4	What is the ovulation &#8220;trigger&#8221; in these mammals?
7.42.summary.33.5	Is it a pheromone, the physical stimulus of coitus, or a chemical signal in the seminal fluid?
7.42.summary.33.6	Researchers studied female koalas to find the answer.
7.42.summary.34.1	The goal of Experiment 1 was to determine whether the presence of a male or the physical act of mating stimulates ovulation.
7.42.summary.34.2	Female koalas were separated into two groups of four.
7.42.summary.34.3	On day 2 of estrus, Group A females were paired with males, and mating occurred.
7.42.summary.34.4	Group B females were housed next to males but without physical contact.
7.42.summary.34.5	At intervals following initiation of exposure to males, the researchers took blood samples from the females and measured luteinizing hormone (LH) as the indicator of ovulation.
7.42.summary.34.6	The results of the blood samples indicated that all four females in Group A showed 25 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL) peaks of LH between 24 and 32 hours postcoitus, and all gave birth 35 days postcoitus.
7.42.summary.34.7	During the same time interval, no females in Group B showed any change in LH hormone levels, and none gave birth.
7.42.summary.35.1	In Experiment 2, female koalas were separated into four groups of nine.
7.42.summary.35.2	On day 2 of estrus, Group A females underwent an artificial insemination procedure but received 1 mL of 0.9% sterile saline.
7.42.summary.35.3	Group B females were artificially inseminated with 1 mL of koala semen.
7.42.summary.35.4	Group C females had their urogenital sinus artificially stimulated with a glass rod designed to mimic the action of a male koala&#8217;s penis during mating.
7.42.summary.35.5	Group D females had the same treatment as females in Group C, followed by artificial insemination with 1 mL of koala semen.
7.42.summary.35.6	At 14 and 28 days after the treatments, the researchers took blood samples from the females and measured levels of progesterone as an indicator of the postovulatory luteal phase.
7.42.summary.35.7	The mean values of blood progesterone levels were calculated for each group and are shown in the figure below.

7.43.1.1	Our internal organization is not symmetrical, and some individuals are born with the mirror-image organization of what is seen in most people   a condition called situs inversus.

7.43.9.1	Go With the Flow
7.43.10.1	Place your hand over your heart.
7.43.10.2	Point to your appendix, then your pancreas.
7.43.10.3	Surely your hand went to the left side of your chest, then to the right side of your lower abdomen, and lastly to the left side of your upper abdomen.
7.43.10.4	Vertebrates are bilaterally symmetrical, but our symmetry is not absolute.
7.43.10.5	Some internal organs are oriented to the left and some to the right.
7.43.10.6	In about 1 out of every 7,000 people, these orientations are reversed, a condition known as situs inversus (&#8220;location inverted&#8221;).
7.43.10.7	The difference arises from events very early in the development of the embryo.
7.43.10.8	Most people with situs inversus lead normal lives and are unaware of their condition until they have diagnostic imaging or surgery.
7.43.11.1	You will learn in this chapter that a mammalian embryo goes from a single layer of cells to the next stage, with two layers of cells, by forming a midline slit, and that cells migrate through that slit to form a second cell layer.
7.43.11.2	Below where the inward movement of cells starts is an area called the node.
7.43.11.3	Each cell at the node has a primary cilium.
7.43.11.4	The primary cilia of some of these cells are nonmotile and probably serve sensory functions.
7.43.11.5	The primary clila of other nodal cells are motile, and they beat in a clockwise motion that moves extracellular fluid across the surface of the node.
7.43.11.6	That fluid movement is from right to left.
7.43.11.7	Why?
7.43.12.1	Imagine that the movement of a cilium describes a clock face oriented so that 12 o&#8217;clock is closest to the embryo&#8217;s future head.
7.43.12.2	The cilia protrude from the cell surfaces at an angle pointing posteriorly.
7.43.12.3	Thus when the cilia rotate through the 6 o&#8217;clock position, they are closer to the cell surface and experience greater resistance than at the 12 o&#8217;clock position.
7.43.12.4	As a result, the circular beating of cilia at this critical spot   the node   creates left   right flow and therefore left   right positional information.
7.43.13.1	Why do we hypothesize that the information generated by beating nodal cilia is responsible for left   right asymmetrical patterns?
7.43.13.2	In mutant strains of mice that have no cilia or only nonmotile cilia in the node, about half of the mice have reversed organ symmetry.
7.43.13.3	Similarly, about half of the people with Kartagener&#8217;s syndrome, a spectrum of rare genetic disorders in humans characterized by nonmotile cilia, have situs inversus.
7.43.14.1	How does the embryo know left from right?

7.43.16.1	43.1 Fertilization Activates Development
7.43.1.1.1	The sperm and the egg make different contributions to the zygote
7.43.1.2.1	Fertilization sets the stage for determination
7.43.1.3.1	Fertilization is the joining of sperm and egg to produce a diploid zygote.
7.43.1.3.2	You might think of fertilization as the event that begins development.
7.43.1.3.3	But keep two things in mind: (1) in asexually reproducing animals, development proceeds without fertilization, and (2) in animals where fertilization does occur, it is preceded by critical events in the maturing egg that influence subsequent development.
7.43.1.3.4	Thus in studying fertilization we are asking how it activates multicellular development in sexually reproducing animals.
7.43.1.4.1	focus your learning
7.43.1.5.1	The egg and sperm contribute different materials to the zygote.
7.43.1.6.1	Sperm entry converts the symmetry of the frog egg from radial to bilateral.
7.43.1.7.1	The movement of cytoplasm, proteins, and organelles following fertilization changes the distribution of critical signaling factors.
7.43.1.8.1	Fertilization does more than restore a full diploid complement of maternal and paternal genes.
7.43.1.8.2	The fusion of sperm and egg cell membranes:
7.43.1.9.1	triggers ion fluxes across the egg membrane.
7.43.1.10.1	creates blocks to the entry of additional sperm into the egg.
7.43.1.11.1	changes the pH of the egg cytoplasm.
7.43.1.12.1	increases egg metabolism and stimulates protein synthesis.
7.43.1.13.1	initiates the rapid series of cell divisions that produce a multicellular embryo.
7.43.1.14.1	We described the mechanisms of fertilization in Key Concept 42.2.
7.43.1.14.2	Here we will take a closer look at the cellular and molecular interactions of sperm and egg that initiate the first steps of development.
7.43.1.1.1.1	In most species, eggs are much larger than sperm.
7.43.1.1.1.2	Egg cytoplasm is well stocked with organelles, nutrients, and a variety of molecules, including cytoplasmic determinants such as transcription factors and mRNAs (see Key Concept 19.2).
7.43.1.1.1.3	Cytoplasmic determinants in the egg play important roles in setting up the signaling cascades that orchestrate the major events of development: determination, differentiation, morphogenesis, and growth.
7.43.1.1.1.4	Nearly everything the embryo needs during its early stages of development comes from the mother, including its mitochondria (and therefore all of its mitochondrial DNA).
7.43.1.1.2.1	In addition to its haploid nucleus, the sperm makes one other crucial contribution to the zygote in most species&#8212;the centriole.
7.43.1.1.2.2	The centriole contributes to the zygote&#8217;s centrosome, which organizes the mitotic spindles for subsequent cell divisions (see Figure 11.9).
7.43.1.1.2.3	Centrioles are also the origin of the microtubules of the primary cilia, which are important in cell signaling, as you will see when we return to the opening question about how embryos know left from right.
7.43.1.2.1.1	Unique attributes of amphibian eggs make them ideal models for illustrating how rearrangements of egg cytoplasm set the stage for determination.
7.43.1.2.1.2	Remember from Key Concept 19.1 that determination sets the developmental fates of cells, and it precedes differentiation&#8212;the expression of different cell properties.
7.43.1.2.1.3	The molecules in the cytoplasm of the amphibian egg are not homogeneously distributed.
7.43.1.2.1.4	The entry of the sperm into the egg stimulates rearrangements of the egg cytoplasm that introduce additional organization to the egg.
7.43.1.2.1.5	Sperm entry establishes the polarity of the zygote, and informational molecules in the egg cytoplasm are organized with respect to that polarity.
7.43.1.2.1.6	Therefore, when cell divisions begin, these informational molecules&#8212;which guide subsequent development&#8212;are not divided equally among daughter cells.
7.43.1.2.2.1	Rearrangement of egg cytoplasm following fertilization is easily observed in some frog species because of pigments in the cytoplasm.
7.43.1.2.2.2	The nutrients in an unfertilized frog egg are dense yolk granules that are concentrated by gravity in the lower half of the egg, called the vegetal hemisphere.
7.43.1.2.2.3	The haploid nucleus of the egg is located at the opposite end, in the animal hemisphere.
7.43.1.2.2.4	The outermost (cortical) cytoplasm of the animal hemisphere is more pigmented than the underlying cytoplasm.
7.43.1.2.2.5	The vegetal hemisphere is not pigmented.
7.43.1.2.2.6	Because of these differences, it is easy to observe how the cytoplasm rearranges when the egg is fertilized.
7.43.1.2.3.1	The unfertilized frog egg is radially symmetrical.
7.43.1.2.3.2	You can turn it on its vegetal&#8211;animal pole axis, and all sides are the same.
7.43.1.2.3.3	Sperm-binding sites are localized on the surface of the animal hemisphere.
7.43.1.2.3.4	When a sperm binds to and enters the egg, the egg&#8217;s radial symmetry is converted to bilateral symmetry and a dorsal&#8211;ventral axis is created.
7.43.1.2.3.5	Cortical cytoplasm rotates toward the site of sperm entry (Figure 43.1).
7.43.1.2.3.6	This rotation brings the animal and vegetal regions of cytoplasm into contact with each other, producing a band of lightly pigmented cytoplasm on the side opposite the site of sperm entry.
7.43.1.2.3.7	This band, called the gray crescent, marks the location of important developmental events in some species of amphibians.
7.43.1.2.3.8	Figure 43.1 The Gray Crescent
7.43.1.2.4.1	The centriole that was the sperm&#8217;s contribution to the egg initiates the cytoplasmic reorganization that coincides with the appearance of the gray crescent.
7.43.1.2.4.2	The centriole organizes the microtubules in the vegetal hemisphere cytoplasm into a parallel array that guides the movement of the cortical cytoplasm as well as proteins and organelles.
7.43.1.2.4.3	Figure 43.2 Cytoplasmic Factors Set Up Signaling Cascades
7.43.1.2.5.1	The movement of cytoplasm, proteins, and organelles changes the distribution of critical signals.
7.43.1.2.5.2	A key transcription factor in early development is &#946;-catenin produced from maternal mRNA (mRNA produced and stored in the egg while it was maturing in the ovary). &#946;-Catenin is found throughout the egg cytoplasm (Figure 43.2).
7.43.1.2.5.3	Also present throughout the egg cytoplasm is a protein kinase, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), that phosphorylates &#946;-catenin and thereby targets it for degradation.
7.43.1.2.5.4	An inhibitor of GSK-3 is localized in the vegetal cortex of the egg.
7.43.1.2.5.5	After sperm entry, this inhibitor moves along microtubules to the gray crescent, where it prevents the degradation of &#946;-catenin.
7.43.1.2.5.6	As a result, the concentration of &#946;-catenin is higher on the dorsal than on the ventral side of the developing embryo, setting up regional differences within the egg cytoplasm that have developmental consequences.
7.43.1.2.6.1	43.1 recap
7.43.1.2.7.1	The egg is stocked with nutrients and informational molecules that power and direct the early stages of development.
7.43.1.2.7.2	Fertilization activates the egg and stimulates rearrangement of the cytoplasm, setting up the body axes and organizing positional information that will control determination and differentiation.
7.43.1.2.8.1	learning outcomes
7.43.1.2.9.1	You should be able to:
7.43.1.2.10.1	Compare the contributions of the sperm and the egg to the zygote.
7.43.1.2.11.1	Explain how sperm entry converts frog egg symmetry from radial to bilateral.
7.43.1.2.12.1	Explain how the distribution of &#946;-catenin in the egg cytoplasm is altered following fertilization and why this alteration is important.
7.43.1.2.13.1	Apart from its nucleus, what is the major contribution of the sperm to subsequent cell signaling in the embryo?
7.43.1.2.14.1	How is the gray crescent generated in the fertilized frog egg?
7.43.1.2.15.1	How does &#946;-catenin become more concentrated on the dorsal side of the amphibian embryo?
7.43.1.2.16.1	The uneven distribution of informational molecules in the cytoplasm of the fertilized egg is essential to later events in development.
7.43.1.2.16.2	In the next section you will see how these informational molecules end up in different cells of the developing embryo.
7.43.1.2.17.1	Chapter 43 continues with
7.43.1.2.18.1	43.2 Mitosis Divides Up the Early Embryo
7.43.2.1.1	Cleavage produces a multicellular embryo
7.43.2.2.1	Cleavage in mammals is unique
7.43.2.3.1	The fates of blastomeres depend on the cytoplasm they receive during cleavage
7.43.2.4.1	Reproductive germ cells are determined early in cleavage
7.43.2.5.1	&#946;-Catenin plays a major role in the cell   cell signaling cascade that begins the process of cell determination and the formation of the embryo.
7.43.2.5.2	But cell   cell signaling requires more than one cell.
7.43.2.5.3	The single-celled zygote must become a multicellular embryo.
7.43.2.6.1	focus your learning
7.43.2.7.1	The three main types of cleavage are complete, incomplete, and superficial.
7.43.2.8.1	Mammalian cleavage is unusual because of the requirements associated with the connection between the embryonic and maternal circulatory systems.
7.43.2.9.1	Determination can arise from informational molecules present in the egg or by information received by their environment and neighboring cells.
7.43.2.10.1	Twins can form in several ways.
7.43.2.11.1	Reproductive germ cells are determined very early in cleavage.
7.43.2.1.1.1	Cleavage is the cell divisions that transform the diploid zygote into a mass of undifferentiated cells that develop as the embryo.
7.43.2.1.1.2	Zygote cytoplasm is not homogeneous, and these first cell divisions result in the differential distribution of nutrients and cytoplasmic determinants in the early embryo.
7.43.2.1.2.1	In most animals, cleavage proceeds with rapid DNA replication and mitosis but with no cell growth and little gene expression.
7.43.2.1.2.2	The embryo becomes a solid ball of smaller and smaller cells.
7.43.2.1.2.3	Eventually this ball forms a central fluid-filled cavity called a blastocoel, and the embryo is called a blastula.
7.43.2.1.2.4	Its individual cells are called blastomeres.
7.43.2.1.2.5	The pattern of cleavage in different species influences the form of their blastulas.
7.43.2.1.3.1	Complete cleavage occurs in eggs that have little yolk such as the eggs of mammals.
7.43.2.1.3.2	Early cleavage furrows divide the egg completely.
7.43.2.1.3.3	The amphibian egg undergoes complete cleavage, but vegetal pole yolk causes unequal cytoplasm division and animal hemisphere blastomeres are smaller than those in the vegetal hemisphere (Figure 43.3A).
7.43.2.1.4.1	Incomplete cleavage occurs in eggs with a lot of yolk and the cleavage furrows do not penetrate it completely.
7.43.2.1.4.2	Discoidal cleavage is a type of incomplete cleavage common in fishes as well as in birds and other reptiles, in which the embryo forms as a disc of cells, or blastodisc, that sits on top of the dense yolk mass (Figure 43.3B).
7.43.2.1.5.1	Superficial cleavage is a variation of incomplete cleavage that occurs in insects such as the fruit fly (Drosophila).
7.43.2.1.5.2	Early in development, cycles of mitosis occur without cell division, producing a syncytium   a single cell with many nuclei (Figure 43.3C).
7.43.2.1.5.3	The nuclei eventually migrate to the periphery of the egg, after which the cell membrane of the egg grows inward, creating a blastoderm by partitioning the nuclei into individual cells surrounding a core of yolk.
7.43.2.1.5.4	Figure 43.3 Some Patterns of Cleavage
7.43.2.1.6.1	The positions of the mitotic spindles during cleavage are not random but are defined by *cytoplasmic determinants produced from the maternal genome and stored in the egg.
7.43.2.1.6.2	The orientation of the mitotic spindles can determine the planes of cleavage and the arrangement of the blastomeres.
7.43.2.1.7.1	* connect the concepts As described in Key Concept 19.2, cytoplasmic determinants are regulatory substances that are distributed unequally in the egg cytoplasm and that influence polarity and cell fate during embryogenesis.
7.43.2.1.8.1	In complete cleavage, if the mitotic spindles of successive cell divisions form parallel or perpendicular to the animal   vegetal axis of the zygote, a pattern of radial cleavage occurs.
7.43.2.1.8.2	The first two cell divisions are parallel to the animal   vegetal axis, and the third is perpendicular to it (see Figure 43.3A).
7.43.2.1.8.3	Spiral cleavage results when the mitotic spindles are at oblique angles to the animal   vegetal axis.
7.43.2.1.8.4	In spiral cleavage, each new cell layer is shifted to the left or right, depending on the orientation of the mitotic spindles.
7.43.2.1.8.5	Most mollusks have spiral cleavage, reflected in some species by a coiling shell pattern (as seen in snails).
7.43.2.2.1.1	Several features of early cell divisions in placental mammals (eutherians) are very different from those seen in other animal groups.
7.43.2.2.1.2	First, this process in mammals is very slow.
7.43.2.2.1.3	Cell divisions are 12 to 24 hours apart, compared with tens of minutes to a few hours in non-mammalian species.
7.43.2.2.1.4	Also, the cell divisions of mammalian blastomeres are not in synchrony with each other.
7.43.2.2.1.5	Because the blastomeres do not undergo mitosis at the same time, the number of cells in the embryo does not increase in the regular progression (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc. ) typical of other species.
7.43.2.2.1.6	The slowness of mammalian cleavage means that genes expressed during cleavage can play roles in cleavage.
7.43.2.2.1.7	In animals such as sea urchins and frogs where cleavage progresses rapidly, very little if any gene transcription occurs in the blastomeres.
7.43.2.2.1.8	Instead, cleavage is directed by molecules that were present in the egg before fertilization.
7.43.2.2.2.1	The pattern of mammalian cleavage is unique and is called rotational cleavage.
7.43.2.2.2.2	The first cell division is parallel to the animal   vegetal axis as in radial cleavage, but in the second cell division, the two blastomeres divide at right angles to one other.
7.43.2.2.2.3	One blastomere divides parallel to the animal   vegetal axis, while the other divides perpendicular to this axis (Figure 43.4A).
7.43.2.2.2.4	As in other animals that have complete cleavage, the early cell divisions in a mammalian zygote produce a loosely associated ball of cells.
7.43.2.2.2.5	After the 8-cell stage, however, the behavior of the mammalian blastomeres changes.
7.43.2.2.2.6	They change shape to maximize their surface contact with one another, form tight junctions (see Figure 6.7), and become a compact mass of cells (Figure 43.4B).
7.43.2.2.2.7	Figure 43.4 Becoming a Blastocyst
7.43.2.2.3.1	Soon after the transition to the 32-cell stage, the cells of the mammalian embryo separate into two groups.
7.43.2.2.3.2	The inner cell mass will develop as the embryo, while the surrounding outer cells become an encompassing sac called the trophoblast.
7.43.2.2.3.3	Trophoblast cells secrete fluid, creating a cavity   the blastocoel   with the inner cell mass at one end.
7.43.2.2.3.4	At this stage the mammalian embryo is called a blastocyst, distinguishing it from the blastulas of other animal groups (Figure 43.4C).
7.43.2.2.3.5	The pluripotent cells of the inner cell mass are known as embryonic stem cells and are the subject of much research because of their therapeutic potential (see Key Concept 19.1).
7.43.2.2.4.1	Why is mammalian cleavage so different?
7.43.2.2.4.2	A key factor is that mammalian eggs contain little or no yolk and must derive all nutrients from the mother.
7.43.2.2.4.3	To support the developing embryo, a connection develops between the circulatory systems of the embryo and the mother.
7.43.2.2.4.4	As you will see later in this chapter, the structures that provide this connection are the placenta and the umbilical cord.
7.43.2.2.4.5	Thus the blastocyst of placental mammals must produce both the embryo (from the inner cell mass) and its support structures (from the trophoblast).
7.43.2.2.5.1	Fertilization in mammals occurs in the upper reaches of the oviduct, and cleavage occurs as the zygote travels down the oviduct to the uterus (Figure 43.5).
7.43.2.2.5.2	When the blastocyst arrives in the uterus, the trophoblast adheres to the lining of the uterus (the endometrium), beginning the process of implantation.
7.43.2.2.5.3	In humans, implantation begins about 6 days after fertilization and is aided by adhesion molecules and enzymes secreted by the trophoblast.
7.43.2.2.5.4	Figure 43.5 A Human Blastocyst at Implantation
7.43.2.2.6.1	As the blastocyst moves down the oviduct to the uterus, it must not embed itself in the oviduct (Fallopian tube) wall, or the result will be an ectopic, or tubal, pregnancy   a very dangerous condition.
7.43.2.2.6.2	Early implantation is prevented by the zona pellucida that surrounded the egg (see Figure 42.6) and remains around the cleaving ball of cells.
7.43.2.2.6.3	At about the time the blastocyst reaches the uterus, it hatches from the zona pellucida so implantation can occur.
7.43.2.3.1.1	Cleavage results in a repackaging of the egg cytoplasm into a large number of small cells surrounding the fluid-filled blastocoel.
7.43.2.3.1.2	Except in mammals, there is little gene expression during early cleavage divisions.
7.43.2.3.1.3	Cells in different regions of the blastula do, however, possess different complements of the nutrients and cytoplasmic determinants that were present in the egg.
7.43.2.3.1.4	For example, Figure 43.2 illustrated the processes by which &#946;-catenin becomes localized in the region of the amphibian zygote that will become the dorsal side of the embryo.
7.43.2.3.2.1	The blastocoel prevents cells from different regions of the blastula from coming into contact and interacting, but that will soon change.
7.43.2.3.2.2	During the next stage of development, the cells of the blastula move around and come into new associations with one another, communicate instructions to one another, and begin to differentiate.
7.43.2.3.2.3	In many animals, these movements of the blastomeres are so regular and well orchestrated that it is possible to label specific blastomeres with a dye, thus producing fate maps that identify the tissues and organs formed from each blastomere&#8217;s progeny (Figure 43.6).
7.43.2.3.2.4	Figure 43.6 Fate Map of a Typical Amphibian Blastula
7.43.2.3.3.1	Blastomeres become determined   committed to specific fates   at different times in different species.
7.43.2.3.3.2	In some species, such as roundworms, the fates of blastomeres are restricted as early as the two-cell stage.
7.43.2.3.3.3	This early determination depends on informational molecules that were originally present in the egg cytoplasm and is called autonomous specification.
7.43.2.3.3.4	If one of these blastomeres is experimentally removed, a particular portion of the embryo will not form.
7.43.2.3.3.5	The resulting developmental pattern has been called mosaic development because each blastomere seems to contribute a specific set of &#8220;tiles&#8221; to the final &#8220;mosaic&#8221; that is the adult animal.
7.43.2.3.3.6	Mosaic development is the common form of development in invertebrates.
7.43.2.3.4.1	The fates of blastomeres in most vertebrate embryos are determined by information they receive from their environment and their neighboring cells.
7.43.2.3.4.2	This mechanism of determination is called regulated specification, and it gives rise to regulative development.
7.43.2.3.4.3	Unlike in mosaic development, the loss of some cells during cleavage in regulative development does not affect the developing embryo, because the remaining cells compensate for the loss.
7.43.2.3.4.4	A subset of the remaining cells may add a cell division, or they may even change their fate to compensate for the cells lost.
7.43.2.3.4.5	Because development is regulative in humans, a single blastomere can be removed from early embryos without harming the remaining blastomeres or disrupting normal development.
7.43.2.3.4.6	Cells removed from embryos produced by in vitro fertilization can be used for preimplantation genetic diagnosis to ensure that healthy embryos are selected for implantation in the mother.
7.43.2.3.5.1	If some blastomeres can change their fate to compensate for the loss of other cells during cleavage and blastula formation, can those cells form an entire embryo?
7.43.2.3.5.2	Yes, in species with regulative development, they can.
7.43.2.3.5.3	If during cleavage or early blastula formation, the blastomeres are physically separated into two groups, both groups can produce complete embryos.
7.43.2.3.5.4	Since the two embryos come from the same zygote, they will be monozygotic twins   genetically identical.
7.43.2.3.6.1	Non-identical twins occur when two separate eggs are fertilized by two separate sperm.
7.43.2.3.6.2	Thus, although identical twins are always the same sex, non-identical twins have a 50 percent chance of being the same sex (that is, the same as two non-twin siblings).
7.43.2.3.6.3	If genetic or environmental factors cause the blastula or blastocyst to split partially, the result is twins who are conjoined at some point on their bodies and usually share some of their organs and limbs.
7.43.2.3.6.4	Conjoined twins occur in about 1 out of 50,000 human pregnancies.
7.43.2.4.1.1	Molecules present in the egg cytoplasm determine which lineage of cells will eventually populate the gonads and become the reproductive stem cells   oogonia and spermatogonia.
7.43.2.4.1.2	In fruit flies, at the ninth nuclear division (recall that the egg is a multinucleate syncytium at this stage; see Figure 43.3C), a group of nuclei migrate to the posterior pole of the egg where they become surrounded by pole plasm   cytoplasm containing a complex mixture of fibrils, mitochondria, and specific proteins and mRNAs.
7.43.2.4.1.3	As the cellularization of the blastoderm proceeds, the nuclei within the pole plasm give rise to the lineage of cells that will eventually migrate to the gonads (when they form) and produce germ cells (eggs and sperm).
7.43.2.4.2.1	As in fruit flies, the germ cell lineage in frogs starts with a special type of cytoplasm   the germ cell plasm   localized to one part of the egg.
7.43.2.4.2.2	As a result of cleavage, the germ cell plasm becomes enclosed within some of the cells in the vegetal hemisphere; descendants of these cells will eventually migrate to the gonads once those structures form.
7.43.2.4.2.3	The components of germ cell plasm have not been fully characterized, but one hypothesis is that they include inhibitors of transcription and translation that prevent these cells from differentiating into anything other than germ cells.
7.43.2.4.3.1	43.2 recap
7.43.2.4.4.1	Cleavage divides up the cytoplasm of the zygote such that different blastomeres contain different combinations of informational molecules.
7.43.2.4.4.2	The amount of nutrients stored in the egg influences the pattern of cell cleavage that produces the blastula.
7.43.2.4.4.3	Blastulation in mammals is different compared to other vertebrates.
7.43.2.4.4.4	The cells that will give rise to germ cell lineages are set aside very early in development.

7.43.2.4.14.1	Why can identical twins arise from a single egg in mammals but not in most invertebrates?
7.43.2.4.15.1	Why is there a longer time between determination and differentiation in germ cells versus skin cells?
7.43.2.4.16.1	Of the next stage of development   gastrulation   the developmental biologist Lewis Wolpert once said, &#8220;It is not birth, marriage, or death, but gastrulation which is the most important time in your life. &#8221; During gastrulation, cell movements create new cell-to-cell contacts, which in turn set up signaling cascades that initiate the differentiation of cells and tissues and set the stage for the emergence of the body plan.

7.43.3.7.1	Gastrulation in mammals is similar to avian gastrulation
7.43.3.8.1	How is bilateral symmetry broken?
7.43.3.9.1	The blastula is typically a fluid-filled ball of cells.
7.43.3.9.2	How does this simple ball of cells become an embryo made up of multiple tissue layers with head and tail ends and dorsal and ventral sides?
7.43.3.9.3	Gastrulation is the process whereby the blastula is transformed by massive movements of cells into an embryo with multiple tissue layers and distinct body axes.
7.43.3.9.4	The resulting spatial relationships between tissues make possible the inductive interactions between cells that trigger differentiation and organ formation.
7.43.3.10.1	focus your learning
7.43.3.11.1	Cell movements during gastrulation result in three germ layers and new tissue interactions.
7.43.3.12.1	Gastrulation in frogs is more complex than in sea urchins, owing to frog blastulas having more yolk and more cell layers.
7.43.3.13.1	The dorsal lip of the blastopore is the primary organizer in the amphibian embryo.
7.43.3.14.1	Showing that a protein is an inductive signal requires that it be both necessary and sufficient for the proposed effect.
7.43.3.15.1	In amphibians, organizer cells moving anteriorly from the dorsal lip of the blastopore initiate the formation of different organs along the anterior   posterior axis.
7.43.3.16.1	Inductive tissue interactions can suppress as well as activate.
7.43.3.17.1	Because bird and reptile eggs have a large yolk mass, the embryos have a flattened blastodisc, and display a pattern of gastrulation very different from that of amphibians.
7.43.3.18.1	In the triploblastic animals (see Key Concept 30.1), three germ layers (also called cell layers or tissue layers, and not to be confused with germ cells) form during gastrulation:
7.43.3.19.1	The endoderm is the innermost germ layer, created as some blastomeres move to the inside of the embryo.
7.43.3.19.2	The endoderm gives rise to the epithelial lining of the digestive tract, respiratory tract, pancreas, thyroid, and liver.
7.43.3.20.1	The ectoderm is the outer germ layer, formed from those cells remaining on the outside of the embryo.
7.43.3.20.2	The ectoderm contributes to the nervous system, including the eyes and ears; and to the epidermal layer of the skin and structures derived from skin, such as hair, feathers, nails or claws, sweat glands, oil glands, and even teeth and other tissues of the mouth.
7.43.3.21.1	The mesoderm is the middle layer and is made up of cells that migrate between the endoderm and the ectoderm.
7.43.3.21.2	The mesoderm contributes tissues to many organs, including the heart, blood vessels, muscles, and bones.
7.43.3.22.1	The three germ layers are illustrated for a very early embryo in the fate map shown in Figure 43.6.
7.43.3.23.1	Some of the most interesting and important challenges in animal development have dealt with two related questions: what directs the cell movements of gastrulation, and what is responsible for the resulting patterns of cell differentiation and organ formation?
7.43.3.23.2	Scientists have made significant progress in answering both these questions at the molecular level.
7.43.3.23.3	In the following discussion we will begin with sea urchin gastrulation because it is the simplest to conceptualize in spatial terms.
7.43.3.23.4	We will then describe the more complex pattern of gastrulation in frogs, and then the still more complex patterns in reptiles (including birds), and mammals.
7.43.3.1.1.1	The sea urchin blastula is a hollow ball of cells only one cell layer thick.
7.43.3.1.1.2	At the end of blastulation the rate of mitosis slows, and the beginning of gastrulation is marked by a flattening of the vegetal hemisphere (Figure 43.7).
7.43.3.1.1.3	Some cells at the vegetal pole break away from neighboring cells and migrate into the cavity to become mesenchyme   cells of the middle germ layer, the mesoderm.
7.43.3.1.1.4	Mesenchymal cells are not organized in tightly packed sheets or tubes like epithelial cells are; they act as independent units, migrating into and among the other tissue layers.
7.43.3.1.1.5	These early mesenchymal cells will contribute to the skeletal structures of the sea urchin.
7.43.3.1.1.6	Figure 43.7 Gastrulation in Sea Urchins
7.43.3.1.2.1	The flattening at the vegetal pole results from changes in the shape of individual blastomeres.
7.43.3.1.2.2	These cells, which are originally rather cuboidal, become wedge-shaped, with smaller outer edges and larger inner edges.
7.43.3.1.2.3	As a result, the vegetal pole bulges inward, or invaginates, as if someone were poking a finger into a hollow ball (see Figure 43.7).
7.43.3.1.2.4	The invaginating cells become endoderm and form the primitive gut, called the archenteron.
7.43.3.1.2.5	The archenteron begins as a short stubby invagination, but its cells extend, flatten, interdigitate, and migrate over one another to form a long thin tube.
7.43.3.1.2.6	This process is called convergent extension.
7.43.3.1.2.7	As the archenteron gets closer to the opposite side of the blastocoel, more mescenchymal cells migrate out of it into the blastocoel.
7.43.3.1.2.8	These cells remain attached to the tip of the archenteron and send out extensions called filopodia that adhere to the overlying ectoderm.
7.43.3.1.2.9	The filopodia contract and pull the archenteron toward the overlying ectoderm.
7.43.3.1.2.10	The mouth of the animal will form where the archenteron makes contact with this overlying ectoderm.
7.43.3.1.2.11	The opening created by the invagination of the vegetal pole is called the blastopore, and it will become the anus of the animal.
7.43.3.1.3.1	We should recall at this point that where the mouth and anus form during gastrulation distinguishes the two major groups of animals that have bilateral symmetry, the protostomes and the deuterostomes (see Key Concept 30.1).
7.43.3.1.3.2	If the blastopore becomes the mouth, the animals are classified as protostomes (&#8220;mouth first&#8221;), and if the blastopore becomes the anus, the animals are classified as deuterostomes (&#8220;mouth second&#8221;).
7.43.3.1.4.1	What mechanisms control the various cell movements of sea urchin gastrulation?
7.43.3.1.4.2	The immediate answer is that specific properties of particular blastomeres change.
7.43.3.1.4.3	For example, some vegetal cells change shape and bulge into the blastocoel, and these cells become mesenchyme.
7.43.3.1.4.4	Once they lose contact with their neighboring cells on the surface of the blastula, they send out filopodia that then move along an extracellular matrix of proteins laid down by the cells lining the blastocoel.
7.43.3.1.5.1	A deeper understanding of gastrulation requires that we discover the molecular mechanisms whereby different blastomeres develop different properties.
7.43.3.1.5.2	Cleavage systematically divides the cytoplasm of the egg.
7.43.3.1.5.3	The sea urchin blastula at the 64-cell stage is radially symmetrical, but it has polarity, as described in Key Concept 19.2.
7.43.3.1.5.4	It consists of tiers of cells.
7.43.3.1.5.5	As in the frog blastula, the top is the animal pole and the bottom the vegetal pole.
7.43.3.1.6.1	If different tiers of blastula cells are separated experimentally, they show different developmental potentials; only cells from the vegetal pole are capable of initiating the development of a complete larva.
7.43.3.1.6.2	It has been proposed that these differences are due to uneven distribution of various transcriptional regulatory proteins in the egg cytoplasm.
7.43.3.1.6.3	As cleavage progresses, these proteins end up in different groups of cells.
7.43.3.1.6.4	Therefore specific sets of genes are activated in different cells, determining their different developmental capacities.
7.43.3.1.7.1	Next we will turn to gastrulation in the frog and to the key signaling molecules involved.
7.43.3.2.1.1	Amphibian blastulas have considerable yolk and are more than one cell layer thick; gastrulation is therefore more complex in amphibians than in sea urchins.
7.43.3.2.1.2	Variation is considerable across different species of amphibians, so this brief account combines results from studies done on different species to produce a generalized picture of amphibian development.
7.43.3.2.2.1	Amphibian gastrulation begins when certain cells in the gray crescent region (see Figure 43.1) change their shapes and cell-adhesion properties.
7.43.3.2.2.2	These cells bulge inward toward the blastocoel while they remain attached to the outer surface of the blastula by slender necks; because of their shape, they are called bottle cells.
7.43.3.2.2.3	Bottle cells mark the spot where the dorsal lip of the blastopore will form (Focus: Key Figure 43.8).
7.43.3.2.3.1	focus: key figure
7.43.3.2.4.1	Figure 43.8 Gastrulation in the Frog Embryo
7.43.3.2.5.1	Yellow, blue, green, and red in this diagram are  matched to those colors in Figure 43.6, the frog fate map.
7.43.3.2.6.1	Q: Epiboly results in the formation of which tissues in the adult frog?
7.43.3.2.7.1	As the bottle cells move inward, the dorsal lip is created, and a sheet of cells moves over it into the blastocoel.
7.43.3.2.7.2	This process is called involution.
7.43.3.2.7.3	One group of involuting cells is the prospective endoderm; these cells form the primitive gut, or archenteron.
7.43.3.2.7.4	Another group will move between the endoderm and the outermost cells to form mesoderm.
7.43.3.2.7.5	As with the extension of the archenteron in the sea urchin, these cell rearrangements involve convergent extension.
7.43.3.2.7.6	The cells elongate in the direction of growth, but they also intercalate (move in between each other).
7.43.3.2.7.7	As gastrulation proceeds, cells from the animal hemisphere flatten and move toward the site of involution in a process called epiboly.
7.43.3.2.7.8	The blastopore lip widens and spreads ventrally, and eventually forms a complete circle surrounding a &#8220;plug&#8221; of yolk-rich cells.
7.43.3.2.7.9	As cells continue to move inward through the blastopore, the archenteron grows, gradually displacing the blastocoel.
7.43.3.2.8.1	As gastrulation comes to an end, the amphibian embryo consists of three germ layers: ectoderm on the outside, endoderm on the inside, and mesoderm in between.
7.43.3.2.8.2	The embryo also has a dorsal   ventral and anterior   posterior organization.
7.43.3.2.8.3	Most important, the fates of specific regions of the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm have been determined.
7.43.3.2.8.4	The beautiful experiments revealing how determination takes place in the amphibian embryo are an old but exciting story.
7.43.3.3.1.1	In the early 1900s the German biologist Hans Spemann was studying the development of salamander eggs.
7.43.3.3.1.2	He was interested in finding out whether the nuclei of blastomeres remain capable of directing the development of complete embryos or whether these nuclei lose some developmental potential.
7.43.3.3.1.3	With great patience and dexterity, he formed loops from single hairs taken from a baby (in fact, his daughter) and tied them around fertilized eggs along the plane of the first cell division, effectively dividing the eggs in half, with the nucleus restricted to one side.
7.43.3.3.1.4	The side containing the nucleus went through cell divisions and developed into a salamander; the other half simply degenerated.
7.43.3.3.1.5	Up until the 16-cell stage, if one nucleus escaped to the other side of the constriction, twin salamanders could develop.
7.43.3.3.1.6	Thus each of the nuclei of the blastula (at least up to the 16-cell stage) was capable of directing and supporting development of the whole organism (regulative development).
7.43.3.3.2.1	As often happens in science, Spemann&#8217;s bisection experiments revealed a new phenomenon.
7.43.3.3.2.2	Sometimes the half of the blastula receiving an escaped nucleus did not develop.
7.43.3.3.2.3	When his loops bisected the gray crescent, both halves of the zygote developed into a complete embryo.
7.43.3.3.2.4	When he tied the loops so the gray crescent was on only one side of the constriction, however, only that half of the zygote developed into a complete embryo (Figure 43.9).
7.43.3.3.2.5	When the half lacking gray crescent material received a nucleus, it underwent cell division but formed only a clump of undifferentiated cells that Spemann called a &#8220;belly piece. &#8221; Spemann hypothesized that cytoplasmic factors unequally distributed in the fertilized egg were necessary for gastrulation and the development of a normal salamander.
7.43.3.3.2.6	Figure 43.9 Gastrulation and the Gray Crescent
7.43.3.3.3.1	To further test the hypothesis that cells receiving different complements of cytoplasmic factors had different developmental fates, Spemann transplanted pieces of early gastrulas to various locations on other gastrulas.
7.43.3.3.3.2	Guided by fate maps (see Figure 43.6), he was able to take a piece of ectoderm he knew would develop into the epidermis of the skin and transplant it to a region that normally becomes part of the nervous system, and vice versa.
7.43.3.3.4.1	When he performed these transplants in early gastrulas   when the blastopore was just beginning to form   the transplanted pieces always developed into tissues that were appropriate for the location where they were placed.
7.43.3.3.4.2	Transplanted cells destined to become epidermis in their original location developed into nervous system tissue, and transplanted cells destined to become nervous system tissue in their original location developed into host epidermis.
7.43.3.3.4.3	Thus Spemann learned that the fates of the transplanted cells had not been determined before the transplantation.
7.43.3.3.5.1	In late gastrulas, however, the same experiment yielded opposite results.
7.43.3.3.5.2	Transplanted cells destined to become epidermis in their original location produced patches of skin cells in the host nervous system, and the transplanted cells from regions that would develop into nervous system tissue produced nervous tissue in the skin of the recipient.
7.43.3.3.5.3	At some point during gastrulation, the fates of the embryonic cells had become determined.
7.43.3.3.6.1	Spemann&#8217;s next experiment, done with his student Hilde Mangold, produced momentous results: they transplanted the dorsal lip of the blastopore (Figure 43.10).
7.43.3.3.6.2	When this small piece of tissue was transplanted into the presumptive belly area of another gastrula, it stimulated a second site of gastrulation   and a second complete embryo formed belly-to-belly with the original embryo.
7.43.3.3.6.3	Because the dorsal lip of the blastopore was apparently capable of inducing the host tissue to form an entire embryo, Spemann and Mangold called the dorsal lip tissue the primary embryonic organizer, or simply the organizer.
7.43.3.3.6.4	For almost 100 years, what has come to be called the Spermann organizer has been an active area of research.

7.43.3.3.11.1	HYPOTHESIS The early dorsal blastopore lip organizes cell differentiation in amphibian embryos.
7.43.3.3.12.1	METHOD
7.43.3.3.13.1	Excise a patch of mesoderm tissue from above the dorsal blastopore lip of an early gastrula stage salamander embryo (the donor).
7.43.3.3.14.1	Transplant the donor tissue onto a recipient embryo at the same stage.
7.43.3.3.14.2	The donor tissue is transplanted onto a region of ectoderm that should become epidermis (skin).
7.43.3.3.15.1	RESULTS
7.43.3.3.16.1	CONCLUSION The cells of the dorsal blastopore lip can induce other cells to change their developmental fates.
7.43.3.4.1.1	With the advent of modern molecular methods, the primary embryonic organizer has been studied intensively to discover the molecular mechanisms involved in its action.
7.43.3.4.1.2	The distribution of the transcription factor &#946;-catenin in the late blastula corresponds to the location of the organizer in the early gastrula, so &#946;-catenin is a candidate for the initiator of organizer activity.
7.43.3.4.1.3	To prove that a protein is an inductive signal, it has to be shown that it is both necessary and sufficient for the proposed effect.
7.43.3.4.1.4	In other words, the effect should not occur if the candidate protein is not present (necessity), and the candidate protein should be capable of inducing the effect where it would otherwise not occur (sufficiency).
7.43.3.4.2.1	The criteria of necessity and sufficiency have been satisfied for &#946;-catenin.
7.43.3.4.2.2	If &#946;-catenin mRNA transcripts are depleted by injections of antisense RNA into the egg (see Key Concept 18.4), gastrulation does not occur.
7.43.3.4.2.3	If &#946;-catenin is experimentally overexpressed in another region of the blastula, it can induce a second axis of embryo formation, as the transplanted dorsal lip did in the Spemann   Mangold experiments.
7.43.3.4.2.4	Thus &#946;-catenin appears to be both necessary and sufficient for the formation of the primary embryonic organizer   but it is only one component of a complex signaling process.
7.43.3.4.2.5	How the presence of &#946;-catenin creates the organizer, and how the organizer then induces the beginnings of the body plan, involves a complex series of interactions between transcription factors and growth factors that control gene expression.
7.43.3.5.1.1	Organizer cells begin the process of formation of the dorsal lip of the blastopore.
7.43.3.5.1.2	Specifically, these cells are at the center of the dorsal lip and involute, moving forward on the midline (i. e. , the middle of the anterior   posterior axis).
7.43.3.5.1.3	The first organizer cells to enter the embryo migrate anteriorly to become the head endoderm and head mesoderm.
7.43.3.5.1.4	Here they induce neighboring cells to participate in making structures of the head.
7.43.3.5.1.5	Organizer cells that involute later in gastrulation induce structures of the trunk, and the last of the organizer cells to move inward from the dorsal lip induce structures of the tail.
7.43.3.5.1.6	How do the organizer cells change to enable them to induce head, trunk, or tail structures?
7.43.3.5.2.1	Inductive tissue interactions can suppress as well as activate.
7.43.3.5.2.2	Goosecoid is a transcription factor expressed by early organizer cells.
7.43.3.5.2.3	Goosecoid activates genes encoding certain signaling factors.
7.43.3.5.2.4	As the early organizer cells move forward in the blastocoel, they come into contact with new populations of cells that produce several different growth factors.
7.43.3.5.2.5	For head structures to form, certain of these growth factors have to be suppressed.
7.43.3.5.2.6	The most anterior organizer cells, under the influence of Goosecoid, produce and release antagonists to those growth factors.
7.43.3.5.3.1	The induction of trunk structures requires suppression of a different set of growth factors.
7.43.3.5.3.2	In organizer cells that involute later than the head organizers, Goosecoid is no longer the dominant transcription factor, and these cells express different growth factor antagonists.
7.43.3.5.3.3	The induction of tail structures requires still different activities of the organizer cells that involute last.
7.43.3.5.3.4	Thus the organizer cells express appropriate sets of growth factor antagonists at the right times to achieve different patterns of differentiation on the anterior   posterior axis.
7.43.3.5.4.1	The initiation of nervous system development also involves a suppressive tissue interaction.
7.43.3.5.4.2	For a long time it was thought that the involuting organizer cells actively induced the overlying ectoderm to form nervous tissue rather than becoming epidermis.
7.43.3.5.4.3	We now know, however, that epidermis is not the default state of the dorsal ectoderm.
7.43.3.5.4.4	Rather, the underlying mesoderm secretes factors called BMP proteins that induce the ectoderm to become epidermis.
7.43.3.5.4.5	The role of the involuting organizer cells is to block that induction, allowing the overlying ectodermal cells to follow what is really their default pathway   differentiation into nervous tissue.
7.43.3.6.1.1	The eggs of reptiles, including birds, contain a mass of yolk, and the blastulas of these groups develop as a disc of cells on top of the yolk (see Figure 43.3B).
7.43.3.6.1.2	We will use the chicken egg to show how gastrulation proceeds in a flat disc of cells rather than in a ball of cells.
7.43.3.6.2.1	Cleavage in the chick results in a flat, circular layer of cells called a blastodisc (Figure 43.11).
7.43.3.6.2.2	Between the blastodisc and the yolk mass is a fluid-filled space.
7.43.3.6.2.3	Some cells from the blastodisc break free and move into this space.
7.43.3.6.2.4	These cells come together to form a continuous layer called the hypoblast, which will later contribute to extraembryonic membranes that will support and nourish the  developing embryo.
7.43.3.6.2.5	The overlying cells make up the epiblast, from which the embryo will form.
7.43.3.6.2.6	Thus the avian blastula is a flattened structure consisting of an upper epiblast and a lower hypoblast, which are joined at the margins of the blastodisc.
7.43.3.6.2.7	The blastocoel is the fluid-filled space between the epiblast and hypoblast.
7.43.3.6.2.8	Figure 43.11 Gastrulation in Birds
7.43.3.6.3.1	Gastrulation begins with a thickening in the posterior region of the epiblast, caused by the movement of cells toward the midline and then forward along the midline (see Figure 43.12).
7.43.3.6.3.2	The result is a midline ridge called the primitive streak.
7.43.3.6.3.3	A depression called the primitive groove forms along the length of the primitive streak.
7.43.3.6.3.4	The primitive groove functions as the blastopore, and cells migrate through it into the blastocoel to become endoderm and mesoderm.
7.43.3.6.4.1	In the chick embryo, no archenteron forms, but the endoderm and mesoderm migrate forward to form the gut and other structures.
7.43.3.6.4.2	At the anterior end of the primitive groove is a thickening called Hensen&#8217;s node, which in reptiles, birds, and mammals is the equivalent of the dorsal lip of the amphibian blastopore.
7.43.3.6.4.3	Many signaling molecules that have been identified in the frog organizer are also expressed in Hensen&#8217;s node.
7.43.3.6.4.4	Cells moving into the blastocoel and moving anteriorly from Hensen&#8217;s node become the notochord and organize the chick embryo in a manner similar to that of the frog embryo.
7.43.3.7.1.1	Mammalian embryos (with the exception of monotremes) derive their nourishment from the maternal circulation, and therefore mammalian eggs do not have large amounts of yolk constraining their cleavage and early development.
7.43.3.7.1.2	Nevertheless, mammals evolved from reptilian ancestors, so it is not surprising that mammals, birds, and reptiles share certain patterns of early development.
7.43.3.7.1.3	Earlier we described the development of the mammalian inner cell mass (the equivalent of the avian blastodisc) and the outer trophoblast.
7.43.3.7.2.1	As in avian development, in placental mammals the inner cell mass splits into an upper layer called the epiblast and a lower layer called the hypoblast.
7.43.3.7.2.2	The embryo forms from the epiblast, while the hypoblast contributes to the extraembryonic membranes that will encase the developing embryo and help form the placenta (see Figure 43.5).
7.43.3.7.2.3	The epiblast also contributes to the extraembryonic membranes; specifically, it splits off an upper layer of cells that will form the amnion.
7.43.3.7.2.4	The amnion will grow to surround the developing embryo as a membranous sac filled with amniotic fluid.
7.43.3.7.2.5	Gastrulation occurs in the mammalian epiblast just as it does in the avian epiblast.
7.43.3.7.2.6	A primitive groove forms, and epiblast cells migrate through the groove to become layers of endoderm and mesoderm.
7.43.3.7.2.7	At the top of the groove is the node which is homologous with Hensen&#8217;s node in birds.
7.43.3.8.1.1	Gastrulation results in the anterior   posterior and dorsal   ventral patterning of the embryo, but all of the mechanisms discussed produce bilateral symmetry.
7.43.3.8.1.2	At the opening of this chapter we introduced an early mechanism that breaks that symmetry to produce the well-known left   right asymmetries of the body.
7.43.3.8.1.3	The heart is on the left; the major lobe of the liver is on the right; the pancreas and spleen are on the left; the appendix is on the right; the major blood vessel leaving the heart, the aorta, bends to the left; the right lung has three lobes and the left lung has two; and so on.
7.43.3.8.1.4	At the very beginning of gastrulation, the location where the involution of cells begins in a mammal is marked by a node of cells.
7.43.3.8.1.5	The ventral surface of the node has ciliated cells.
7.43.3.8.1.6	Some of these cilia are motile and others are not.
7.43.3.8.1.7	The motile cilia create a leftward flow of extracellular fluid over the node.
7.43.3.8.1.8	The experiments in Investigating Life: Does the Direction of Nodal Flow Influence the Development of Left   Right Asymmetry in the Mouse Embryo? investigate whether that directional flow is both necessary and sufficient to initiate signaling processes that break bilateral symmetry of the embryo.

7.43.3.8.6.1	HYPOTHESIS The leftward flow of extracellular fluid created by the beating of nodal primary cilia is the stimulus for breaking bilateral symmetry in organ development the mouse.
7.43.3.8.7.1	METHOD
7.43.3.8.8.1	Mount wild-type mouse embryos at different stages of development (presomite and 1, 2, or 3 somites; see Figure 43.13) in a culture medium   filled chamber with their nodal ends pointed upward.
7.43.3.8.9.1	Artificially pump culture medium through the chamber either from the left (normal) or from the right (reversed) and at slow or fast flow rates.
7.43.3.8.10.1	After 4 days assess the embryos as to the direction of looping (normal or reversed) of their developing heart tubes.
7.43.3.8.11.1	RESULTS
7.43.3.8.12.1	Since there were different numbers of embryos in different conditions, and some embryos did not survive, the data are displayed as percent of the total sample under each condition that showed normal or reversed direction of looping of their heart tubes.
7.43.3.8.12.2	For example, in the slow left column there were 16 total embryos: 12 had normal direction of looping and 4 had reversed looping.
7.43.3.8.12.3	The graph displays how heart-looping patterns were affected in the presomite stage by the direction of culture-medium flow.

7.43.3.8.13.1	aN = normal heart looping; R = reversed looping; T = total embryos in sample.
7.43.3.8.14.1	CONCLUSIONS When extracellular fluid moved across the node from right to left, the direction of heart-tube looping was normal.
7.43.3.8.14.2	If this signal was weak (slow left flow), or if a weak reversed signal was applied (slow right flow), there was a small effect on normal direction of heart-tube looping, but when the reversed signal was strong, the heart-tube looping was in the reversed direction.
7.43.3.8.14.3	These results support the conclusion that nodal flow is an important signal in breaking bilateral symmetry in the mouse embryo.
7.43.3.8.15.1	work with the data
7.43.3.8.16.1	The experiment illustrated in the graph was done on presomite embryos   before any somites had formed.
7.43.3.8.16.2	Developmental signals usually have a time window of effectiveness given that developmental events are sequential and different events must be coordinated.
7.43.3.8.16.3	Is there a time window within which nodal flow determines left   right symmetry in the embryo?
7.43.3.8.16.4	To investigate the timing of sensitivity to nodal flow, another experiment was conducted using only fast right flow on early embryos at different stages of development.

7.43.3.8.17.1	QUESTIONS
7.43.3.8.18.1	Plot the data as the percent of responses on the y axis and developmental stage on the x axis.
7.43.3.8.19.1	Why did this experiment not include left flow as a stimulus?
7.43.3.8.20.1	Do these data provide evidence for a sensitive period for nodal flow determining left   right asymmetry?
7.43.3.8.21.1	What do you conclude from the results on the 1-, 2-, and 3-somite wild-type embryos?
7.43.3.8.22.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.43.3.8.23.1	43.3 recap
7.43.3.8.24.1	The cell movements of gastrulation convert the blastula into an embryo with three tissue layers.

7.43.3.8.25.1	learning outcomes
7.43.3.8.26.1	You should be able to:
7.43.3.8.27.1	Compare and contrast gastrulation in frogs and sea urchins.
7.43.3.8.28.1	Explain the experiment that revealed the role of the dorsal lip of the amphibian blastopore in embryonic development.

7.43.3.8.33.1	The sea urchin blastula develops into a radially symmetrical larva, but the frog blastula develops into a bilateral embryo.
7.43.3.8.33.2	How does this difference relate to processes of gastrulation in these two types of animals?
7.43.3.8.34.1	What is meant by satisfying the criteria of necessity and sufficiency, and how did the Spemann   Mangold experiments use these criteria to demonstrate the role of the dorsal lip of the blastopore as the primary embryonic organizer?
7.43.3.8.35.1	How do the cells of the primary organizer induce different structures on the anterior   posterior axis as they migrate from the dorsal lip to the head region of the embryo?
7.43.3.8.36.1	How does gastrulation in reptiles compare with that in amphibians?
7.43.3.8.37.1	We have described how the fertilized egg develops into an embryo with three germ layers and how cellular signals trigger different patterns of differentiation.
7.43.3.8.37.2	In the next section we will describe how organs and organ systems develop.
7.43.3.8.38.1	Chapter 43 continues with
7.43.3.8.39.1	43.4 Organs Develop from the Three Germ Layers
7.43.4.1.1	The organizer sets the stage for organogenesis
7.43.4.2.1	Body segmentation is an early feature of vertebrate development
7.43.4.3.1	Hox genes control differentiation along the anterior   posterior axis
7.43.4.4.1	Gastrulation produces an embryo with three germ layers that are positioned to influence one another through inductive tissue interactions.
7.43.4.4.2	During the next phase of development, called organogenesis, organs and organ systems develop simultaneously and in coordination with each other.
7.43.4.4.3	In the chordates (see Key Concept 32.1), an early process of organogenesis is neurulation, the initiation of the nervous system.
7.43.4.4.4	We will examine neurulation in the amphibian embryo, but it occurs in a similar fashion in reptiles (including birds), and in mammals.
7.43.4.5.1	focus your learning
7.43.4.6.1	The chordamesoderm forms the notochord and initiates neurulation.
7.43.4.7.1	Segmented blocks of cells, known as somites, produce cells that develop into the vertebrae, ribs, trunk muscles, and limbs.
7.43.4.8.1	Hox genes control differentiation on the anterior   posterior axis of vertebrates.
7.43.4.9.1	Genetic and environmental factors can lead to neural tube defects.
7.43.4.1.1.1	One group of cells that passes over the dorsal lip of the blastopore moves anteriorly and becomes the endodermal lining of the digestive tract.
7.43.4.1.1.2	Another group of cells that passes over the dorsal lip on the midline becomes chordamesoderm, so named because it forms a rod of mesoderm   the notochord   that extends down the center of the embryo.
7.43.4.1.1.3	These cells also have important organizer functions (see Figure 43.8).
7.43.4.1.1.4	The notochord gives structural support to the developing embryo and in vertebrates is replaced by the vertebral column.
7.43.4.1.1.5	The organizing capacity of the chordamesoderm enables the overlying ectoderm to become neural ectoderm.
7.43.4.1.2.1	Neurulation involves the formation of an internal neural tube from an external sheet of cells.
7.43.4.1.2.2	The first signs of neurulation are flattening and thickening of the ectoderm overlying the notochord; this thickened area forms the neural plate (Figure 43.12A).
7.43.4.1.2.3	The edges of the neural plate that run in an anterior   posterior direction continue to thicken to form ridges or folds.
7.43.4.1.2.4	Between these neural folds, a groove forms and deepens as the folds roll over it to converge on the midline.
7.43.4.1.2.5	The folds fuse, forming a cylinder, the neural tube, and a continuous overlying layer of epidermal ectoderm (Figure 43.12 B   D).
7.43.4.1.2.6	Figure 43.12 Neurulation in a Vertebrate (A)
7.43.4.1.3.1	Cells from the most lateral portions of the neural plate do not become part of the neural tube, but disassociate from it and come to lie between the neural tube and the overlying epidermis.
7.43.4.1.3.2	These neural crest cells migrate outward to lead the development of the connections between the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and the rest of the body.
7.43.4.1.3.3	Neural crest cells give rise to many diverse structures including jaws, skull, face, pigment cells, glands, smooth muscle, and many others.
7.43.4.1.4.1	The neural tube develops bulges at the anterior end, which become the major divisions of the brain; the rest of the tube becomes the spinal cord.
7.43.4.1.4.2	In humans, failure of the neural folds to fuse in this posterior region results in spina bifida, a birth defect in which the spinal cord is exposed because the vertebrae do not fuse.
7.43.4.1.4.3	If the folds fail to fuse at the anterior end, an infant can develop without a forebrain (a condition called anencephaly).
7.43.4.1.4.4	Although several genetic factors can cause these defects, other factors are environmental, including maternal diet.
7.43.4.1.4.5	The incidence of neural tube defects in the United States in the early 1900s was as high as 1 in 300 live births; today it is less than 1 in 1,000.
7.43.4.1.4.6	A major factor in this improvement has been the inclusion of folic acid (a B vitamin, also known as folate) in the mother&#8217;s diet.
7.43.4.1.4.7	It is essential for pregnant women to ingest sufficient folic acid.
7.43.4.2.1.1	The vertebrate body plan, like that of arthropods, consists of repeating segments that are modified during development.
7.43.4.2.1.2	These segments are most evident as the repeating patterns of vertebrae, ribs, nerves, and muscles along the anterior   posterior axis.
7.43.4.2.2.1	As the neural tube forms, mesodermal tissues gather along the sides of the notochord to form separate, segmented blocks of cells called somites (Figure 43.13).
7.43.4.2.2.2	Somites produce cells that will become the vertebrae, ribs, muscles of the trunk, and limbs.
7.43.4.2.2.3	Figure 43.13 Developing Body Segmentation
7.43.4.2.3.1	Nerves that connect the brain and spinal cord with tissues and organs throughout the body are also arranged segmentally.
7.43.4.2.3.2	The somites help guide the organization of these peripheral nerves, but the nerves are not of mesodermal origin.
7.43.4.2.3.3	As you saw above, when the neural tube fuses, the neural crest cells break loose and migrate inward between the epidermis and the somites and through the somites.
7.43.4.2.3.4	These neural crest cells have diverse fates, including the development of peripheral nerves.
7.43.4.2.4.1	As development progresses, the different segments of the body change.
7.43.4.2.4.2	Regions of the spinal cord differ, regions of the vertebral column differ in that some vertebrae grow ribs of various sizes and others do not, forelegs arise in the anterior part of the embryo, and hind legs arise in the posterior region.
7.43.4.3.1.1	How is mesoderm in the anterior part of a mouse embryo programmed to produce forelegs rather than hind legs?
7.43.4.3.1.2	In Key Concept 19.4, you saw how homeotic genes control body segmentation in Drosophila.
7.43.4.3.1.3	You also learned that all homeotic genes contain a DNA sequence called the homeobox.
7.43.4.3.1.4	In vertebrates, the homeotic genes that control differentiation along the anterior   posterior body axis are called Hox genes (see Key Concept 19.3).
7.43.4.3.2.1	In mammals, four Hox gene complexes reside on different chromosomes in clusters of about ten genes each.
7.43.4.3.2.2	Remarkably, the temporal and spatial expression of these genes generally follows the same pattern as their linear order on their chromosome.
7.43.4.3.2.3	That is, the Hox genes closest to the 3    end of each gene complex are expressed first and in the anterior of the embryo.
7.43.4.3.2.4	The Hox genes at the 5    end of the gene complex are expressed later and in a more posterior part of the embryo.
7.43.4.3.2.5	As a result, different segments of the embryo receive different combinations of Hox gene products, which serve as transcription factors (Figure 43.14; see also Figure 19.15).
7.43.4.3.2.6	Figure 43.14 Hox Genes Control Body Segmentation
7.43.4.3.3.1	Whereas Hox genes give cells information about their position on the anterior   posterior body axis, other genes provide information about their dorsal   ventral position.
7.43.4.3.3.2	Tissues in each segment of the body differentiate according to their dorsal   ventral location.
7.43.4.3.3.3	The notochord provides many of these signals.
7.43.4.3.4.1	After body segmentation develops, the formation of organs and organ systems progresses rapidly.
7.43.4.3.4.2	The development of an organ involves extensive inductive interactions.
7.43.4.3.4.3	An example is the ability of the chordamesoderm to induce overlying ectoderm to become neural ectoderm, and form the neural tube (see Figure 43.12).
7.43.4.3.4.4	These inductive interactions are a current focus of study for developmental biologists.
7.43.4.3.5.1	43.4 recap
7.43.4.3.6.1	Gastrulation sets up tissue interactions that initiate organogenesis.
7.43.4.3.6.2	Neurulation is initiated by organizer mesoderm that forms the notochord.
7.43.4.3.6.3	Neurulation results in the formation of the central nervous system, and associated neural crest cells form the peripheral nerves.
7.43.4.3.6.4	Suites of Hox genes are expressed sequentially in vertebrates, but in overlapping patterns providing a variety of signaling molecule patterns that govern differentiation on the anterior   posterior axis.
7.43.4.3.7.1	learning outcomes
7.43.4.3.8.1	You should be able to:
7.43.4.3.9.1	Describe how nervous system development begins with neurulation.
7.43.4.3.10.1	Describe the formation of somites and their role in development.
7.43.4.3.11.1	Explain how genetic and environmental factors can influence neural tube formation.
7.43.4.3.12.1	Explain how a limited number of Hox genes can organize complex anterior   posterior patterning of the vertebrate embryo.
7.43.4.3.13.1	How does the ectoderm overlying the notochord respond to chordamesoderm signals to form a neural tube as well as neural crest cells?
7.43.4.3.14.1	What might be a consequence of a failure in somite formation in the embryo?
7.43.4.3.15.1	How do Hox genes generate a diversity of signals sufficient to control differentiation of tissues and organs on the anterior   posterior axis?
7.43.4.3.16.1	You have seen how the basic structure of the developing embryo arises, through the establishment of the anterior   posterior and dorsal   ventral axes, the formation of the neural tube, and the emergence of a segmented body plan.
7.43.4.3.16.2	In the next section we will examine the developmental events that result in the formation of structures that support the developing embryo: the extraembryonic membranes and the placenta.
7.43.4.3.17.1	Chapter 43 continues with
7.43.4.3.18.1	43.5 Extraembryonic Membranes Nurture Avian and Mammalian Embryos
7.43.5.1.1	Birds develop four extraembryonic membranes
7.43.5.2.1	The mammalian placenta forms from extraembryonic membranes
7.43.5.3.1	Human gestation is divided into trimesters
7.43.5.4.1	There is more to a developing reptile or mammal than the embryo itself.
7.43.5.4.2	The embryos of these vertebrates are surrounded by several extraembryonic membranes that originate from the embryo but are not part of it.
7.43.5.4.3	Extraembryonic membranes function in nutrition, gas exchange, and waste removal.
7.43.5.4.4	In mammals they interact with tissues of the mother to form the placenta.
7.43.5.4.5	The evolutionary relationships between the extraembryonic membranes of birds and mammals were discussed in Key Concept 32.4.
7.43.5.5.1	focus your learning
7.43.5.6.1	The four extraembryonic membranes in birds are the yolk sac, the allantoic membrane, the amnion, and the chorion.
7.43.5.7.1	The placenta forms from the embryonic chorion and tissues of maternal uterine wall.
7.43.5.8.1	During the first trimester, the embryo is most sensitive to environmental effects.
7.43.5.1.1.1	The chicken provides a good example of how extraembryonic membranes form from the germ layers created during gastrulation.
7.43.5.1.1.2	In the chick, four membranes form   the yolk sac, the allantoic membrane, the amnion, and the chorion.
7.43.5.1.1.3	The yolk sac is the first to form, and it does so by extension of the hypoblast layer along with some adjacent mesoderm.
7.43.5.1.1.4	The yolk sac grows to enclose the entire body of yolk in the egg (Figure 43.15).
7.43.5.1.1.5	It constricts at the top to create a tube that is continuous with the gut of the embryo.
7.43.5.1.1.6	However, yolk does not pass through this tube.
7.43.5.1.1.7	Yolk is digested by the cells of the yolk sac, and the nutrients are transported to the embryo through blood vessels that form from mesoderm and line the outer surface of the yolk sac.
7.43.5.1.1.8	The allantoic membrane is also an outgrowth of the extraembryonic endoderm plus adjacent mesoderm.
7.43.5.1.1.9	It forms the allantois, a sac for storage of metabolic wastes.
7.43.5.1.1.10	Figure 43.15 The Extraembryonic Membranes
7.43.5.1.2.1	Ectoderm and mesoderm combine and extend beyond the limits of the embryo to form the other extraembryonic membranes.
7.43.5.1.2.2	Two layers of cells extend all along the inside of the eggshell, both over the embryo and below the yolk sac.
7.43.5.1.2.3	Where they meet, they fuse, forming two membranes, the inner amnion and the outer chorion.
7.43.5.1.2.4	The amnion surrounds the embryo, forming the amniotic cavity.
7.43.5.1.2.5	The amnion secretes fluid into the cavity, providing a protective environment for the embryo.
7.43.5.1.2.6	The outer membrane, the chorion, forms a continuous membrane just under the eggshell (see Figure 43.16) that limits water loss from the egg.
7.43.5.1.2.7	The exchange of O2 and CO2 between the embryo and the environment requires diffusion of those gases across the chorion and the allantois.
7.43.5.2.1.1	In placental mammals, the first extraembryonic membrane to form is the trophoblast (see Figures 43.4C and 43.5).
7.43.5.2.1.2	When the blastocyst reaches the uterus and hatches from its encapsulating zona pellucida, trophoblast cells interact directly with the endometrium.
7.43.5.2.1.3	Adhesion molecules expressed on the surfaces of these cells attach them to the uterine wall.
7.43.5.2.1.4	By secreting proteolytic enzymes, the trophoblast burrows into the endometrium, beginning the process of implantation.
7.43.5.2.1.5	Eventually the entire trophoblast is within the wall of the uterus.
7.43.5.2.1.6	The trophoblast cells send out numerous projections, or villi, to increase the surface area of contact with maternal blood.
7.43.5.2.2.1	Meanwhile, the hypoblast cells proliferate to form what in the bird would be the yolk sac.
7.43.5.2.2.2	But there is virtually no yolk in eggs of placental mammals; instead the yolk sac contributes mesodermal tissues that interact with trophoblast tissues to form the chorion.
7.43.5.2.2.3	The chorion, along with tissues of the uterine wall, produces the placenta, the organ that exchanges nutrients, respiratory gases, and metabolic wastes between the mother and the embryo (Figure 43.16).
7.43.5.2.2.4	Figure 43.16 The Mammalian Placenta
7.43.5.2.3.1	At the same time the yolk sac is forming from the hypoblast, the epiblast produces the amnion, which grows to enclose the entire embryo in a fluid-filled amniotic cavity.
7.43.5.2.3.2	The rupturing of the amnion and chorion and the loss of amniotic fluid (the &#8220;water breaks&#8221;) herald onset of labor in humans.
7.43.5.2.4.1	An allantois also develops in mammals, but its importance depends on how well nitrogenous wastes can be removed by the blood vessels of the placenta.
7.43.5.2.4.2	The human allantoic sac is small because the human placenta deals effectively with the fetal nitrogenous wastes.
7.43.5.2.4.3	In contrast, the pig placenta is less effective at clearing nitrogenous wastes from the fetus, so the pig&#8217;s allantoic sac is large.
7.43.5.2.4.4	In humans and other placental mammals, allantoic tissues contribute to the formation of the umbilical cord, by which the embryo is attached to the chorionic placenta (see Figure 32.19B).
7.43.5.2.4.5	It is through the blood vessels of the umbilical cord that nutrients and oxygen from the mother reach the developing fetus, and wastes, including carbon dioxide and urea, are removed.
7.43.5.3.1.1	In humans, gestation, or pregnancy, lasts about 266 days, or 9 months.
7.43.5.3.1.2	Gestation is shorter in smaller mammals (21 days in mice) and longer in larger mammals (600 days in elephants).
7.43.5.3.1.3	The events of human gestation (Figure 43.17) can be divided into three trimesters of roughly 3 months each.
7.43.5.3.1.4	The first trimester (see Figure 43.17A) is a time of rapid cell division and tissue differentiation.
7.43.5.3.1.5	Because signal transduction cascades that determine sequences of developmental processes are in their early stages, the first trimester is the period when the embryo is most sensitive to damage from radiation, drugs, chemicals, and pathogens that can cause birth defects.
7.43.5.3.1.6	An embryo can be damaged before the mother even realizes she is pregnant.
7.43.5.3.1.7	A classic case is that of thalidomide, a drug widely prescribed in Europe in the late 1950s to treat nausea.
7.43.5.3.1.8	Women who took this drug in the fourth and fifth weeks of pregnancy, when the embryo&#8217;s limbs are beginning to form, gave birth to children with missing or severely malformed arms and legs.
7.43.5.3.1.9	Figure 43.17 Stages of Human Development (A)
7.43.5.3.2.1	During the second trimester the fetus grows rapidly; its limbs elongate, and its fingers, toes, and facial features become well formed (see Figure 43.17B).
7.43.5.3.2.2	Eyebrows and fingernails grow, and the fetus&#8217;s nervous system develops rapidly.
7.43.5.3.2.3	Fetal movements are first felt by the mother early in the second trimester and become progressively stronger and more coordinated.
7.43.5.3.3.1	The fetus grows rapidly during the third trimester.
7.43.5.3.3.2	As this final stage approaches its end (see Figure 43.17C), the internal organs mature.
7.43.5.3.3.3	The digestive system begins to function, the liver stores glycogen, the kidneys produce urine, and the brain undergoes cycles of sleep and waking.
7.43.5.3.3.4	A human infant is born when the last of its critical organs   the lungs   mature.
7.43.5.3.4.1	Although the first-trimester embryo is the most susceptible to adverse effects of drugs, chemicals, and diseases, the potential for serious effects from exposure to environmental factors exists throughout pregnancy.
7.43.5.3.4.2	Protein malnutrition and exposure to alcohol and cigarette smoke are examples of factors that can result in low birth weight, mental retardation, and other developmental complications.
7.43.5.3.5.1	43.5 recap
7.43.5.3.6.1	The extraembryonic membranes of reptiles and mammals sustain the growing embryo.
7.43.5.3.6.2	In reptiles these membranes surround the embryo within the shelled egg.
7.43.5.3.6.3	In mammals the extraembryonic membranes form the placenta, an organ that exchanges nutrients, respiratory gases, and metabolic wastes between the mother and the embryo.
7.43.5.3.6.4	Human gestation lasts 9 months.
7.43.5.3.6.5	At the end of the first trimester, the fetus is very small but most of its organs have begun to form.
7.43.5.3.6.6	In the second trimester, limbs elongate and the fetus moves.
7.43.5.3.6.7	By the end of the third trimester, most organs have begun to function.
7.43.5.3.7.1	learning outcomes
7.43.5.3.8.1	You should be able to:
7.43.5.3.9.1	Describe the formation of the yolk sac, amnion, chorion, and allantois, using the chick as an example.
7.43.5.3.10.1	Summarize how the placenta forms.
7.43.5.3.11.1	Explain why a first-trimester embryo is particularly sensitive to environmental risks for birth defects.
7.43.5.3.12.1	Which germ layers participate in the development of the chick&#8217;s yolk sac, allantois, chorion, and amnion?
7.43.5.3.13.1	What is the origin of the placenta in mammalian development?
7.43.5.3.14.1	Why is a first-trimester embryo particularly sensitive to environmental risks?
7.43.5.3.15.1	investigatinglife
7.43.5.3.16.1	How does the embryo know left from right?
7.43.5.3.17.1	At the beginning of gastrulation in the mammal when midline cells of the epiblast begin to move inward to create the primitive groove, a region called the node forms at the anterior end of the groove.
7.43.5.3.17.2	Motile cilia at the node create a flow of extracellular fluid across the node.
7.43.5.3.17.3	Non-motile nodal cilia are believed to sense the direction of fluid flow across the node.
7.43.5.3.17.4	There are two hypotheses about how these cilia function, one chemical and the other mechanical.
7.43.5.3.17.5	Both sensory mechanisms are used by cilia elsewhere in the body.
7.43.5.3.17.6	In the nose, cilia of the olfactory cells sense chemicals.
7.43.5.3.17.7	In the ear, cilia are bent by sound waves, which stimulates ion channels to open.
7.43.5.3.17.8	The leftward flow of fluid across the node imposes mechanical forces on the nonmotile cilia that differ on the two sides of the node.
7.43.5.3.17.9	Other research, however, supports the possibility of chemical signaling.
7.43.5.3.17.10	Research on the mouse node shows that the beating of the cilia causes proteins of a certain size range to form a concentration gradient across the node.
7.43.5.3.17.11	More important, it was discovered that nodal cells secrete small vesicles that are swept to the left side of the node by the flow and burst when they contact the nonmotile cilia of surrounding cells.
7.43.5.3.17.12	The contents of these vesicles could be the chemical signals that initiate left   right asymmetry in gene expression and development.
7.43.5.3.18.1	Future directions
7.43.5.3.19.1	A major player in the determination of left   right asymmetry is the primary cilium of cells in the node that forms during gastrulation.
7.43.5.3.19.2	However, just about every cell in the body has a primary cilium.
7.43.5.3.19.3	Up until fairly recently the primary cilia were thought to be vestigial structures or simply organelles to sequester the centriole and thereby inhibit cell division.
7.43.5.3.19.4	We now know that the primary cilia of cells function widely in mechanisms of cell signaling and in transduction of physical and chemical stimuli.
7.43.5.3.19.5	Just about every organ in the body uses primary cilia for essential functions.
7.43.5.3.19.6	Primary cilia have been implicated in many medical conditions such as cancer, kidney disease, obesity, blindness, and developmental disorders.
7.43.5.3.19.7	In the near future we will be seeing lots of new discoveries about the functions of primary cilia.

7.43.summary.1.1	43.1
7.43.summary.2.1	Fertilization Activates Development
7.43.summary.3.1	The sperm and the egg contribute differentially to the zygote.
7.43.summary.3.2	The sperm contributes a haploid nucleus and, in most species, a centriole.
7.43.summary.3.3	The egg contributes a haploid nucleus, nutrients, ribosomes, mitochondria, mRNAs, and proteins.
7.43.summary.4.1	In amphibians, the cytoplasmic contents of the unfertilized egg are not distributed homogeneously, and they are rearranged after fertilization to set up the major axes of the future embryo.
7.43.summary.4.2	The nutrient molecules are generally found in the vegetal hemisphere, whereas the nucleus is found in the animal hemisphere.
7.43.summary.4.3	Review Figures 43.1, 43.2 43.2
7.43.summary.5.1	Mitosis Divides Up the Early Embryo
7.43.summary.6.1	The protein &#946;-catenin activates a signaling cascade that induces the primary embryonic organizer and sets up the anterior   posterior body axis.
7.43.summary.6.2	Review Figures 43.2
7.43.summary.7.1	Cleavage is a period of rapid cell division.
7.43.summary.7.2	Except in mammals, little if any gene expression occurs during cleavage.
7.43.summary.7.3	Cleavage can be complete or incomplete, and the pattern of cell divisions depends on the orientation of the mitotic spindles.
7.43.summary.7.4	The result of cleavage is a ball or mass of cells called a blastula.
7.43.summary.7.5	Review Figure 43.3
7.43.summary.8.1	Early cell divisions in mammals are unique in being slow and allowing for gene expression early in the process.
7.43.summary.8.2	These cell divisions produce a blastocyst composed of an inner cell mass that becomes the embryo and an outer cell mass that develops as the trophoblast.
7.43.summary.8.3	At the time of implantation, the trophoblast secretes molecules that help the blastocyst implant in the uterine wall.
7.43.summary.8.4	Review Figures 43.4, 43.5
7.43.summary.9.1	A fate map can be created by labeling specific blastomeres and observing what tissues and organs are formed by their progeny later in development.
7.43.summary.9.2	Review Figure 43.6
7.43.summary.10.1	Some species undergo mosaic development, in which the fate of each cell is determined during early divisions.
7.43.summary.10.2	Other species, including vertebrates, undergo regulative development, in which remaining cells can compensate for cells lost in early cleavages. 43.3
7.43.summary.11.1	Gastrulation Generates Multiple Tissue Layers
7.43.summary.12.1	Gastrulation involves massive cell movements that produce three germ layers and place cells from various regions of the blastula into new associations with one another.
7.43.summary.12.2	Review Figure 43.7, Animation 43.1
7.43.summary.13.1	The initial step of sea urchin and amphibian gastrulation is inward movement of certain blastomeres.
7.43.summary.13.2	The site of inward movement becomes the blastopore.
7.43.summary.13.3	Cells that move into the blastula become the endoderm and mesoderm; cells remaining on the outside become the ectoderm.
7.43.summary.13.4	Cytoplasmic factors in the vegetal pole cells are essential to initiate development.
7.43.summary.13.5	Review Figure 43.7, Focus: Key Figure 43.8
7.43.summary.14.1	The dorsal lip of the amphibian blastopore is a critical site for cell determination.
7.43.summary.14.2	It has been called the primary embryonic organizer, or organizer, because it induces determination in cells that pass over it during gastrulation.
7.43.summary.14.3	Review Figures 43.8   43.10, Animation 43.2
7.43.summary.15.1	Gastrulation in reptiles, including birds, differs from that in sea urchins and frogs because the large amount of yolk causes the blastula to form a flattened disc of cells.
7.43.summary.15.2	Review Figure 43.11
7.43.summary.16.1	Although their eggs have no yolk, placental mammals have a pattern of gastrulation similar to that of reptiles and birds.
7.43.summary.17.1	The direction of extracellular fluid flow over the ventral surface of the node breaks bilateral symmetry in the mammalian gastrula.
7.43.summary.17.2	Review Investigating Life: Does the Direction of Nodal Flow Influence the Development of Left   Right Asymmetry in the Mouse Embryo? 43.4
7.43.summary.18.1	Organs Develop from the Three Germ Layers
7.43.summary.19.1	Gastrulation is followed by organogenesis, the process where tissues interact to form organs and organ systems.
7.43.summary.20.1	In the formation of the vertebrate nervous system, one group of cells that migrates over the blastopore lip is determined to become the notochord.
7.43.summary.20.2	The notochord organizes the overlying ectoderm to thicken, form parallel ridges, and fold in on itself to form a neural tube below the epidermal ectoderm.
7.43.summary.20.3	The nervous system develops from this neural tube.
7.43.summary.20.4	Review Figure 43.12
7.43.summary.21.1	The notochord and neural crest cells participate in the segmental organization of mesoderm into structures called somites along the body axis.
7.43.summary.21.2	Rudimentary organs and organ systems form during these stages.
7.43.summary.21.3	Review Figure 43.13
7.43.summary.22.1	In vertebrates, Hox genes determine the pattern of anterior   posterior differentiation along the body axis.
7.43.summary.22.2	Other genes, such as sonic hedgehog, contribute to dorsal   ventral differentiation.
7.43.summary.22.3	Review Figure 43.14 43.5
7.43.summary.23.1	Extraembyronic Membranes Nurture Avian and Mammalian Embryos
7.43.summary.24.1	The embryos of reptiles and mammals are protected and nurtured by four extraembryonic membranes.
7.43.summary.24.2	In reptiles the yolk sac surrounds the yolk and provides nutrients to the embryo, the chorion lines the eggshell and participates in gas exchange, the amnion surrounds the embryo and encloses it in an aqueous environment, and the allantois stores metabolic wastes.
7.43.summary.24.3	Review Figure 43.15, Activity 43.1
7.43.summary.25.1	In mammals the chorion and the trophoblast cells interact with the maternal uterus to form a placenta, which provides the embryo with nutrients and gas exchange.
7.43.summary.25.2	The amnion encloses the embryo in an aqueous environment.
7.43.summary.25.3	Review Figure 43.16
7.43.summary.26.1	Human pregnancy, or gestation, lasts 9 months.
7.43.summary.26.2	The embryo forms in the first trimester; during this time, it is most vulnerable to environmental factors that can lead to birth defects.
7.43.summary.26.3	During the second and third trimesters the fetus grows, external features form, and the organ systems mature.

7.44.8.1	Balancing the Brain
7.44.9.1	Your brain enables you to learn the material in this chapter   to read the words, understand the illustrations, and store information to allow you to answer questions.
7.44.9.2	You must study to master this chapter, but if you do you will learn how the brain receives and processes information.
7.44.10.1	Imagine what it would be like if you could not learn any of this material   no matter how much you poured over the book.
7.44.10.2	This is the situation faced by individuals with a condition known as Down syndrome, which affects 1 out of every 700 children born in the United States.
7.44.11.1	Individuals with Down syndrome are born with three copies of most of chromosome 21, one of the smallest of the human chromosomes (containing about 225 confirmed genes).
7.44.11.2	Having an extra copy of these genes causes numerous developmental and functional problems, including learning disability.
7.44.11.3	Can we understand the cause of this disability and perhaps find a way to remedy it?
7.44.12.1	One productive way of investigating the causes and possible treatments for a human disease or deficit is to develop an animal model.
7.44.12.2	Through genetic engineering, researchers created a &#8220;Down syndrome mouse&#8221; that has most of the same genes triplicated as those in humans with Down syndrome.
7.44.12.3	These mice cannot perform in mouse memory tests as normal mice do.
7.44.12.4	The mouse Down syndrome model revealed that excess inhibition in the brain causes the learning disability.
7.44.12.5	What is meant by &#8220;excess inhibition in the brain&#8221;?
7.44.12.6	We tend to think mostly about the excitatory actions of the brain, likening the brain to a puppet master who pulls the strings that activate the muscles and organs of the body.
7.44.12.7	In fact the brain is more like an orchestra conductor, making some sections louder, some softer, speeding up, slowing down.
7.44.12.8	The brain must constantly maintain a delicate balance of excitation and inhibition, acting on some signals and ignoring others.
7.44.12.9	In the brains of Down syndrome model mice there is consistently too much inhibition.
7.44.12.10	When inhibition is experimentally reduced with certain drugs, the mice are able to learn.
7.44.12.11	Research like this is a first step toward bringing potential therapies for humans into clinical trials in the hope of improving the cognitive functions of individuals with Down syndrome.
7.44.13.1	Can learning be restored in mouse models of Down syndrome?

7.44.15.1	44.1 Neurons and Glia Are Unique Cells of Nervous Systems
7.44.1.1.1	Vertebrate neurons and macroglia originate in the embryonic neural tube
7.44.1.2.1	The structure of neurons reflects their functions
7.44.1.3.1	Glia are the &#8220;silent partners&#8221; of neurons
7.44.1.4.1	Nervous systems are informational systems.
7.44.1.4.2	They encode, process, and store a wide variety of information from the external and internal environments, and they use that information to control and regulate the physiology and behavior of the organism.
7.44.1.4.3	The nervous systems of all animals can carry out these functions because of the properties of a unique class of cells: nerve cells, or neurons.
7.44.1.4.4	Vertebrate nervous systems also include another unique class of cells called glial cells or glia.
7.44.1.5.1	focus your learning
7.44.1.6.1	The structure of a neuron defines its functions in receiving, integrating, and communicating information.
7.44.1.7.1	Specific types of glial cells have unique roles within the nervous system to support, insulate, and nurture neurons and to affect neuronal signaling.
7.44.1.8.1	There are many types of neurons, which vary in size, shape, and function, but they all generate and conduct electric signals.
7.44.1.8.2	Glia do not generate and conduct electric signals, and there are two major types   macroglia and microglia.
7.44.1.8.3	Macroglia support and modulate the functions of neurons.
7.44.1.8.4	Microglia are phagocytic cells derived from blood-forming stem cells.
7.44.1.8.5	Microglia are motile, are activated by foreign matter or damage to neural tissue, and are the first and major immune defense mechanism in the nervous system.
7.44.1.9.1	Nervous systems in all but the simplest invertebrates are divided into central and peripheral divisions.
7.44.1.9.2	The central division includes dense assemblages of neurons that process and store information and generate commands.
7.44.1.9.3	In lower invertebrates these assemblages of neurons are called ganglia.
7.44.1.9.4	With increased complexity, some large ganglia of invertebrates are designated as brains.
7.44.1.9.5	In vertebrates the central nervous system (CNS) includes the brain and spinal cord.
7.44.1.9.6	The peripheral nervous system (PNS) provides communication between the central division and all of the rest of the body.
7.44.1.1.1.1	Neurons and macroglia have a common origin in the neural tube of the early vertebrate embryo (see Figure 43.14).
7.44.1.1.1.2	The neural tube contains rapidly dividing neuronal stem cells.
7.44.1.1.1.3	Initially the divisions of these neural stem cells are symmetrical   all of the progeny are stem cells.
7.44.1.1.1.4	Eventually, however, the cell divisions become asymmetrical, with one daughter cell remaining a stem cell and the other daughter cell becoming either a neural progenitor cell or a macroglial progenitor cell   a neuroblast or a gliablast.
7.44.1.1.1.5	These progenitor cells produce the neurons and glia that together form the various structures of the nervous system.
7.44.1.2.1.1	Neurons vary enormously in structure and appearance, but they have a basic structure that includes four regions (Figure 44.1).
7.44.1.2.1.2	Figure 44.1 A Generalized Neuron
7.44.1.2.2.1	A cell body contains the nucleus and most of the cell&#8217;s organelles.
7.44.1.2.3.1	Shrublike projections called dendrites (Greek dendron, &#8220;tree&#8221;) may extend from the cell body.
7.44.1.2.3.2	Dendrites receive information from other neurons or sensory cells and bring it to the cell body.
7.44.1.2.4.1	In most neurons, one projection   the axon   is much longer than the others.
7.44.1.2.4.2	Axons carry information from the cell body to target cells.
7.44.1.2.5.1	At the target cell, the axon divides into a spray of fine nerve endings.
7.44.1.2.5.2	The tips of these tiny nerve endings have swellings called axon terminals.
7.44.1.2.6.1	Neurons have a wide variety of forms that reflect different functionalities (Figure 44.2).
7.44.1.2.6.2	Neurons with few dendrites receive information from specific and limited sources, whereas neurons with large arrays of dendrites can collect and integrate information from a wide range of sources.
7.44.1.2.6.3	Some neurons communicate over very short distances, but others communicate over extremely long distances and therefore have very long axons.
7.44.1.2.6.4	For example, axons from neurons in your spinal cord control the muscles in your toes.
7.44.1.2.6.5	Figure 44.2 Neurons Have Many and Varied Forms
7.44.1.2.7.1	Regardless of form and function, all neurons process and communicate information through changes in the electric potential across their membranes.
7.44.1.2.7.2	As in all cells, the electric charge on the inside of the cell membrane of a neuron is slightly negative in comparison with the outside.
7.44.1.2.7.3	The electric potential across the cell membranes of neurons can change in response to specific stimuli, and these electric potential changes can travel along the cell membrane.
7.44.1.2.7.4	In most neurons, small changes in membrane electric potential generate large, rapidly reversed changes in membrane potential that are called action potentials (APs).
7.44.1.2.7.5	Axons conduct APs over long distances.
7.44.1.2.8.1	In summary, a neuron receives specific stimuli (e. g. , light, sound, pressure, chemicals) that cause changes in the electric potentials across the cell membranes of its dendrites.
7.44.1.2.8.2	These electric signals from dendrites spread to and are averaged by the cell body.
7.44.1.2.8.3	Changes in the electric potential of the membrane of the cell body at the base of its axon can cause an AP that is conducted along the axon to its terminals.
7.44.1.2.8.4	APs can travel at speeds up to 100 meters per second (360 kilometers per hour), making it possible for an individual to sense, process, and act on information very quickly.
7.44.1.2.9.1	What happens when the AP reaches the axon terminals?
7.44.1.2.9.2	Axon terminals come extremely close to the membrane of the target cell, which can be another neuron, a muscle cell, or a secretory cell.
7.44.1.2.9.3	Structures called synapses form at these locations.
7.44.1.2.9.4	The synapse transfers the information conveyed by the AP from the presynaptic cell to the postsynaptic cell (see Figure 44.1).
7.44.1.2.10.1	Synapses can be either electrical or chemical.
7.44.1.2.10.2	Electrical synapses allow the AP to pass directly between two neurons.
7.44.1.2.10.3	In vertebrates most synapses are chemical.
7.44.1.2.10.4	At chemical synapses a space about 25 nanometers wide (about 1/2000th the width of a human hair) separates the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes.
7.44.1.2.10.5	An AP arriving at an axon terminal causes it to release chemical messenger molecules called neurotransmitters.
7.44.1.2.10.6	Neurotransmitters diffuse across the synaptic space and bind to receptors on the cell membrane of the postsynaptic (target) cell.
7.44.1.2.10.7	The binding of the neurotransmitter to its receptor alters the activity of the postsynaptic neuron.
7.44.1.2.10.8	Some neurotransmitter   receptor combinations inhibit activity of the postsynaptic neuron, and other neurotransmitter   receptor combinations excite it.
7.44.1.2.10.9	Neurons integrate information by summing excitatory and inhibitory inputs.
7.44.1.3.1.1	The human brain has at least as many glial cells as neurons.
7.44.1.3.1.2	The ratio differs in different brain areas, and in some areas is considerably greater than 1 to 1.
7.44.1.3.1.3	A neurobiologist once said that &#8220;flashy neurons get all of the attention, but glial cells do most of the brain&#8217;s work and are the cause of many of its diseases. &#8221; It has been easier to study the functions of neurons because their APs can be observed.
7.44.1.3.1.4	The mostly silent glia are more difficult to study, and therefore we know much less about them.
7.44.1.3.1.5	Our knowledge of glia will grow enormously in the years to come.
7.44.1.3.2.1	Like neurons, glia come in several forms and have diverse functions.
7.44.1.3.2.2	As mentioned above, microglia are macrophages (see Figure 41.3) and provide immune defense responses for the nervous system.
7.44.1.3.2.3	Macroglia include Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes.
7.44.1.3.2.4	In the brain and spinal cord, oligodendrocytes wrap around the axons of neurons, covering them with concentric layers of cell membrane.
7.44.1.3.2.5	You can think of this wrapping as being insulation, like the insulation on electrical wires.
7.44.1.3.2.6	It prevents electric current from leaking out of the axon.
7.44.1.3.2.7	Outside the brain and spinal cord, Schwann cells provide this same function for the peripheral nerves that communicate between the brain and spinal cord and all parts of the body (Figure 44.3).
7.44.1.3.2.8	Myelin is the wrapping produced by oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, and it gives many parts of the nervous system a glistening white appearance.
7.44.1.3.2.9	Not all axons are myelinated, but those that are conduct APs more rapidly than can axons that are not myelinated, for reasons described in Key Concept 44.2.
7.44.1.3.2.10	Figure 44.3 Glial Cells Insulate Axons (A)
7.44.1.3.3.1	Diseases that affect myelin can be devastating because they impair conduction of APs.
7.44.1.3.3.2	The most common of these demyelinating diseases is multiple sclerosis (MS)   literally &#8220;multiple scars&#8221;   which occurs in about 1 in 700 people in the United States.
7.44.1.3.3.3	The cause of MS is not known, but it involves inflammatory autoimmune damage to the myelin in the brain and spinal cord.
7.44.1.3.3.4	The symptoms of the disease depend on where in the nervous system the myelin is damaged.
7.44.1.3.3.5	Motor impairment is common.
7.44.1.3.3.6	An example of a demyelinating disease that attacks myelin outside the brain and spinal cord is Guillain   Barre syndrome, which is usually the result of a severe infection.
7.44.1.3.3.7	Environmental factors such as pesticide exposure can also damage myelin.
7.44.1.3.3.8	There are no known cures for demyelinating diseases.
7.44.1.3.4.1	The third type of macroglia, astrocytes (so named because they look like stars), contribute to the blood   brain barrier that protects the brain from toxic chemicals in the blood.
7.44.1.3.4.2	Blood vessels throughout the body are very permeable to many chemicals, including toxic ones, that would reach the brain if this barrier did not exist.
7.44.1.3.4.3	Astrocytes help form the blood   brain barrier by surrounding the smallest, most permeable blood vessels in the brain.
7.44.1.3.4.4	The barrier is not perfect, however.
7.44.1.3.4.5	Because it consists of cell membranes, it is permeable to fat-soluble substances such as anesthetics and alcohol (which explains why these substances have such rapid and marked effects on the nervous system).
7.44.1.3.5.1	In addition to their role in the blood   brain barrier, astrocytes have several known functions at the synapse:
7.44.1.3.6.1	They can take up neurotransmitter that has been released into the synapse and thereby control communication between the pre- and postsynaptic cells.
7.44.1.3.7.1	They can supply neurons with nutrients.
7.44.1.3.7.2	Neurons have no energy reserves, but astrocytes store glycogen that they can break down to supply the neurons with fuel.
7.44.1.3.8.1	They have signaling properties.
7.44.1.3.8.2	Even though most astrocytes do not generate APs , they do release neurotransmitters that can alter the activities of neurons.
7.44.1.3.9.1	They aid in the repair and regeneration of neurons.
7.44.1.3.10.1	They make contact with both blood vessels and neurons and can therefore signal changes in the composition of the blood.
7.44.1.3.11.1	Astrocytes play crucial yet poorly understood roles in modulating synapse activity.
7.44.1.3.11.2	The projections of a single astrocyte may make contact with more than 100,000 synapses.
7.44.1.3.11.3	The contact of the astrocyte with the neuronal components of the synapse is so intimate that it has inspired the concept of the tripartite synapse   the idea that a synapse includes not only the pre- and postsynaptic neurons but also connections from astrocytes.
7.44.1.3.12.1	Although astrocytes do not generate APs , they do communicate with each other.
7.44.1.3.12.2	They are connected to each other through electrical synapses, and the electric signals traveling across these synapses cause changes in the Ca2+ content of the postsynaptic astrocyte.
7.44.1.3.12.3	When Ca2+-sensitive dyes are applied to neural tissue, Ca2+ waves can be seen traveling through extensive networks of astrocytes.
7.44.1.3.12.4	The functions of these Ca2+ waves are not understood.
7.44.1.3.13.1	44.1 recap
7.44.1.3.14.1	Nervous systems have two unique types of cells: neurons and glia.
7.44.1.3.14.2	There are many types of neurons, but they can all generate and conduct electric signals, and most generate APs.
7.44.1.3.14.3	A neuron has four regions: cell body, dendrites, axon, and axon terminals.
7.44.1.3.14.4	Neurons communicate with target cells at synapses, which can be chemical or electrical.
7.44.1.3.14.5	Although glia do not generate APs, they have a variety of functions, including contributing to the blood   brain barrier, insulating axons, and modulating synaptic activity.
7.44.1.3.15.1	learning outcomes

7.44.1.3.21.1	Explain how a neuron integrates information received from several other neurons.
7.44.1.3.22.1	Explain how astrocytes modulate synaptic activity.
7.44.1.3.23.1	The one feature common to neurons is that they process information in the form of changes in the electric potential across their cell membranes.
7.44.1.3.23.2	In the next section we will focus on how electric signals are generated and transmitted by neurons.
7.44.1.3.24.1	Chapter 44 continues with
7.44.1.3.25.1	44.2 Neurons Generate and Transmit Electric Signals
7.44.2.1.1	Simple electrical concepts underlie neuronal function
7.44.2.2.1	Activities of neurons are recorded as changes in membrane potential
7.44.2.3.1	Ion transporters and channels generate membrane potentials
7.44.2.4.1	Ion channels and their properties can be studied directly
7.44.2.5.1	Gated ion channels alter membrane potential
7.44.2.6.1	Graded changes in membrane potential can integrate information
7.44.2.7.1	Sudden changes in Na+ and K+ channels generate action potentials
7.44.2.8.1	Action potentials are conducted along axons without loss of signal
7.44.2.9.1	Action potentials jump along myelinated axons
7.44.2.10.1	Various ion pumps create ion concentration gradients across animal cell membranes.
7.44.2.10.2	For example, Na+ concentrations are higher outside cells and K+ concentrations are higher inside.
7.44.2.10.3	The positive charges of these ions are balanced by negatively charged ions both inside and outside the cell.
7.44.2.10.4	But, across the cell membrane there is an electric charge difference, with the inside of the cell being negative relative to the outside.
7.44.2.10.5	This electrical charge is due to the cell membrane being differentially permeable to certain ions.
7.44.2.10.6	For neurons at rest, their membranes are mostly permeable to K+, and that permeability is primarily responsible for the electrical charge across their membranes.
7.44.2.11.1	focus your learning
7.44.2.12.1	The membrane at rest is close to the equilibrium potential for K+ due to the selective permeability to K+ through &#8220;leak&#8221; channels open at rest.
7.44.2.13.1	When gated ion channels are activated by electrical, chemical, or mechanical stimuli, permeability of the membrane to the respective ions changes, resulting in a change in membrane potential.
7.44.2.14.1	Potential changes, through both inhibitory and excitatory inputs, are summed and result in the membrane potential deviating from the resting potential.
7.44.2.15.1	Rapid activation and inactivation of voltage-gated Na+ channels are responsible for action potentials.
7.44.2.16.1	Action potentials are all-or-none, self-regenerating events that are conducted rapidly and unidirectionally along axons.
7.44.2.16.2	Myelination of axons results in saltatory conduction, which is faster than conduction in nonmyelinated axons.
7.44.2.17.1	Because the concentration of K+ is higher inside the cell than in the extracellular fluid, K+ diffuses out of the cell down its concentration gradient.
7.44.2.17.2	But when K+ leaks out of the cell, it leaves behind an unbalanced negative electric charge that tends to pull K+ back into the cell.
7.44.2.17.3	An equilibrium is reached when the tendency for K+ to diffuse out is countered by the electric charge pulling K+ back in.
7.44.2.17.4	The resulting charge difference across the membrane is called the membrane potential, with the inside of the cell negative relative to the outside.
7.44.2.17.5	Membrane potentials exist in all cells.
7.44.2.18.1	Membrane potentials exist in all cells.
7.44.2.18.2	In neurons the steady-state membrane potential is called the resting potential.
7.44.2.18.3	Stimuli that cause changes in the permeability of the cell membrane cause local changes in that membrane potential.
7.44.2.18.4	These local changes can generate the large electrical signals called action potentials (APs) that are conducted along the axons and convey information about the stimulus that caused the initial small change in membrane potential.
7.44.2.18.5	The AP is a sudden, large, transient change in membrane potential generated by sudden changes in permeability to Na+ ions.
7.44.2.18.6	Before describing the mechanisms of these permeability changes and the resulting APs in detail, a review of some simple concepts of electricity may be useful.
7.44.2.1.1.1	Voltage (electric potential difference) is a force that causes electrically charged particles to move between two points.
7.44.2.1.1.2	Voltage is to the flow of electrically charged particles as pressure is to the flow of water.
7.44.2.1.1.3	If the negative and positive poles of a battery are connected by a wire, an electric current will flow through the wire because there is a voltage difference between the two poles.
7.44.2.1.1.4	This flow of electric current can be used to do work, just as a current of water can be used to do work.
7.44.2.1.2.1	In wires, electric current is carried by electrons, but in solutions and across cell membranes, electric current is carried by ions.
7.44.2.1.2.2	The major ions that carry electric charges across the cell membranes of neurons are sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and chloride (Cl   ).
7.44.2.1.2.3	Recall that ions with opposite charges attract one another and those with like charges repel one another.
7.44.2.1.2.4	How do these basic principles of bioelectricity establish the resting potential of the neuronal cell membrane?
7.44.2.1.2.5	And how is the flow of ions through membrane channels turned on and off to generate APs?
7.44.2.2.1.1	We record electrical events in a cell using electrodes.
7.44.2.2.1.2	Figure 44.4 shows how this technique is applied across the cell membrane of a neuron to measure the resting potential, which is usually between    60 and    70 millivolts (mV).
7.44.2.2.1.3	The minus sign indicates that the inside of the cell is electrically negative compared with the outside.
7.44.2.2.2.1	research tools
7.44.2.2.3.1	Figure 44.4 Measuring the Membrane Potential
7.44.2.2.4.1	An electrode can be made from a glass pipette with a very sharp tip filled with a solution that conducts electric charges.
7.44.2.2.4.2	If one electrode is placed inside the neuron and another one on the outside of the cell membrane, the difference in voltage across the cell membrane can be measured.
7.44.2.2.5.1	As explained above, the resting potential is largely due to a balance between the tendency of K+ ions to diffuse down their concentration gradient and the electrical potential that holds them back.
7.44.2.2.5.2	This resting potential provides a means for a neuron to respond to stimuli.
7.44.2.2.5.3	If some determinant of this balance of forces is altered, the membrane potential will change.
7.44.2.2.5.4	The concentration gradient of the different ions inside and outside of the neuron may not change, but if the permeability of the membrane to ions changes, the membrane potential will change.
7.44.2.2.5.5	Therefore, any chemical or physical stimulus that changes the permeability of the cell membrane to ions will cause a change in the cell&#8217;s membrane potential.
7.44.2.2.5.6	For example, what would happen to the cell membrane potential if there was a sudden increase in the permeability of the membrane to Na+ ions.
7.44.2.2.5.7	Na+ ions are more abundant outside the cell than inside.
7.44.2.2.5.8	Also, the inside of the resting cell is negatively charged which attracts the positively charged N+ ions.
7.44.2.2.5.9	Thus, a sudden large increase in permeability of the membrane to Na+ would cause a change of the membrane potential in the positive direction.
7.44.2.2.5.10	If the change in Na+ permeability were transient, the membrane potential would rapidly return to its resting, negative value.
7.44.2.2.5.11	Such a rapid change in membrane potential is an AP.
7.44.2.3.1.1	The cell membranes of neurons, like those of all other cells, are lipid bilayers that are impermeable to ions but contain many protein molecules that serve as *ion transporters and ion channels.
7.44.2.3.1.2	Ion transporters and channels are responsible for the distribution of charges across the membrane that determine membrane potential.
7.44.2.3.2.1	*connect the concepts The passive and active mechanisms that transport materials across cell membranes are discussed in Key Concepts 6.3 and 6.4.
7.44.2.3.2.2	The passive mechanisms are membrane proteins that form channels (see Figure 6.10), and the active mechanisms (which require ATP) are membrane proteins engaged in active transport (see Figure 6.14).
7.44.2.3.3.1	Ion transporters require energy to move ions against their concentration or electrical gradients and are therefore called ion pumps.
7.44.2.3.3.2	A major ion transporter in the cell membranes of neurons (and all other cells) is the sodium   potassium pump, so called because it actively expels Na+ ions from inside the cell, exchanging them for K+ ions from outside the cell (see Figure 6.14).
7.44.2.3.3.3	The Na+   K+ pump is also known as sodium   potassium ATPase, a term emphasizing that it is an enzyme complex requiring ATP to do its work.
7.44.2.3.3.4	The Na+   K+ pump keeps the concentration of K+ inside the cell greater than the K+ concentration of the extracellular fluid, and the concentration of Na+ inside the cell less than that of the extracellular fluid.
7.44.2.3.3.5	The concentration differences established by this active transporter mean that K+ would diffuse out of the cell and Na+ would diffuse in if the ions could cross the lipid bilayer.
7.44.2.3.3.6	How do these concentration gradients relate to the electrical gradients we discussed above?
7.44.2.3.4.1	Ion channels permit the diffusion of ions across membranes.
7.44.2.3.4.2	These channels are water-filled pores formed by proteins that span  the lipid bilayer and are generally selective, allowing some types of ions to pass through more easily than others (see Figure 6.11).
7.44.2.3.4.3	Thus there are potassium channels, sodium channels, chloride channels, and calcium channels, and there are different kinds of channels for each ion.
7.44.2.3.4.4	Ions can diffuse through these channels in either direction.
7.44.2.3.4.5	The direction and magnitude of the net movement of ions through a channel depend on the concentration gradient of that ion type across the cell membrane, as well as on the voltage difference across that membrane.
7.44.2.3.4.6	These two motive forces acting on an ion are termed its electrochemical gradient.
7.44.2.3.4.7	Although the electrochemical gradient drives the movement of ions through channels, that movement is modified by gates that open and close the channels.
7.44.2.3.5.1	Potassium channels are the most common open, or leak, channels in the cell membranes of resting (nonstimulated) neurons.
7.44.2.3.5.2	As a consequence, resting neurons are more permeable to K+ than to any other ion.
7.44.2.3.5.3	Thus, open potassium channels are largely responsible for the resting membrane potential.
7.44.2.3.5.4	Because the potassium channels make the cell membrane permeable to K+, and because the Na+   K+ pump keeps the concentration of K+ inside the cell much higher than that outside the cell, K+ tends to diffuse down its electrochemical gradient, out of the cell, through the channels.
7.44.2.3.5.5	But, if K+ ions left the cell they would leave behind unbalanced negative charges, generating an electric potential across the membrane that tends to pull K+ back into the cell.
7.44.2.3.6.1	The membrane potential at which the net diffusion of K+ out of the cell ceases (that is, the point at which K+ diffusion out due to the concentration gradient is balanced by its inward movement due to the negative electric potential) is the potassium equilibrium potential, or EK.
7.44.2.3.6.2	The value of EK can be calculated from the concentrations of K+ on the two sides of the membrane using the Nernst equation (Figure 44.5A).
7.44.2.3.6.3	This equation, developed in the late 1800s, shows that the existence of ion channels in neuronal membranes was hypothesized long before their specific structures and properties were discovered.
7.44.2.3.7.1	research tools
7.44.2.3.8.1	Figure 44.5A Using the Nernst Equation
7.44.2.3.9.1	The Nernst equation calculates membrane potential when only one type of ion can cross a membrane that separates solutions with different concentrations of that ion.
7.44.2.3.10.1	Measure concentrations of ions inside and outside a neuron.
7.44.2.3.10.2	To measure the concentration of ions in a neuron, the neuron (and its axon) must be big.
7.44.2.3.10.3	Squid have giant neurons that control their escape response (see Figure 44.13C).
7.44.2.3.10.4	It is possible to sample the cytoplasm of these axons, which are about 1 mm in diameter.
7.44.2.3.11.1	Use the Nernst equation to calculate what the membrane potential would be if it were permeable to each of the ions that are differently concentrated on the two sides of the membrane: Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl   .
7.44.2.3.11.2	The Nernst equation predicts the membrane potential resulting from membrane permeability to a single type of ion that differs in concentration on the two sides of the membrane.
7.44.2.3.11.3	The equation is written
7.44.2.3.12.1	where E is the equilibrium (resting) membrane potential (the voltage across the membrane in mV), R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, z is the charge on the ion, and F is the Faraday constant.
7.44.2.3.12.2	The subscripts o and i indicate the ion concentrations outside and inside the cell, respectively.
7.44.2.3.12.3	At this point you could just &#8220;plug and play,&#8221; but do you understand this equation?
7.44.2.3.12.4	A concentration difference of ions across a membrane creates a chemical force that pushes the ions across the membrane by diffusion; however, the resulting unbalanced electric charges will pull the ions back the other way.
7.44.2.3.12.5	At equilibrium, the two forces are in balance and there is no net movement of ions across the membrane.
7.44.2.3.12.6	The chemical energy pushing the ions will equal 2.3 RT log [ion]o/[ion]i The electric energy pulling the ions will equal zEF.
7.44.2.3.12.7	So, at equilibrium:
7.44.2.3.13.1	Rearranging the equation to solve for E, we get the Nernst equation:
7.44.2.3.14.1	We can simplify the equation by picking a temperature   let&#8217;s use &#8220;room temperature,&#8221; or 20  C   and solving for 2.3 RT/F. At 20  C, 2.3 RT/F equals 58.
7.44.2.3.14.2	Thus:
7.44.2.3.15.1	Measuring ion concentrations in squid giant axon cytoplasm and in seawater, then solving the Nernst equation for each ion, we find: Ion concentration (mM) Predicted membrane potential (mV) Ion in squid axon in seawater K+ 400 20 75 Na+ 50 460 +56 Ca2+ 0.5 10 +38 Cl 50 560 60
7.44.2.3.16.1	Since the measured membrane potential is    66 mV, it is clear that the resting potential of the axon is due to permeability of the membrane to more than just one type of ion.

7.44.2.3.21.2	But you also saw (at the end of Figure 44.5A) that the equilibrium membrane potential is the product of more than one ion.
7.44.2.3.21.3	The Goldman equation (frequently called the Goldman, Hodgkin, Katz equation) calculates the equilibrium membrane potential by taking into account all of the ions that can diffuse across a given membrane and the relative permeabilities of the membrane to those ions.
7.44.2.3.21.4	The ions involved in mammalian neurons here are K+, Na+, and Cl   , and the Goldman equation is

7.44.2.3.22.2	The membrane&#8217;s permeability to potassium ions is the highest, so pK =1.0.
7.44.2.3.22.3	Then pNa = 0.05 and pCl = 0.44.

7.44.2.3.25.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.44.2.3.26.1	In the late 1940s, A. L. Hodgkin and A. F. Huxley at the University of Cambridge set out to study the electrical properties of axonal membranes.
7.44.2.3.26.2	With the techniques available at that time, the necessary measurements could be made only if you had a very large axon to work with.
7.44.2.3.26.3	Such an axon exists in nature   the huge neuron that controls the escape response of squid.
7.44.2.3.26.4	Hodgkin and Huxley used electrodes to measure the voltage across the cell membrane of this large axon, as seen in Figure 44.5, and to pass electric current into it to change its membrane potential.
7.44.2.3.26.5	They also changed the concentrations of Na+ and K+ both inside and outside the squid axon and measured the resulting changes in membrane potential.
7.44.2.3.26.6	On the basis of their many careful experiments, Hodgkin and Huxley developed virtually all of our basic concepts about the electrical properties of neurons, and they shared a Nobel Prize in 1963.
7.44.2.3.27.1	The resting potential of a neuron is less negative than the EK calculated from the Nernst equation.
7.44.2.3.27.2	This means that the resting potential is not due solely to leak K+ channels.
7.44.2.3.27.3	The neuronal membrane is slightly permeable to other ions, especially Na+ and Cl   , and movements of these ions influence the resting potential.
7.44.2.3.27.4	A different equation takes into account (1) all of the ions that can cross the membrane and (2) the relative permeability of the membrane to those ions.
7.44.2.3.27.5	This equation, called the Goldman equation, predicts the membrane potential more accurately than does the Nernst equation (Figure 44.5B).
7.44.2.4.1.1	Because Hodgkin and Huxley were working long before there were laboratory techniques enabling the investigation of ion channels, they could only hypothesize ion channel properties.
7.44.2.4.1.2	These hypotheses could not be tested until the late 1970s, when B. Sakmann and E. Neher developed a technique called patch clamping, for which they shared the Nobel Prize in 1991.
7.44.2.4.1.3	Patch clamping, described in Figure 44.6, is widely used by neurobiologists, enabling them to record in real time the tiny electric currents caused by the openings and closings of single ion channels.
7.44.2.4.2.1	research tools
7.44.2.4.3.1	Figure 44.6 Patch Clamping
7.44.2.4.4.1	The patch clamp electrode is a glass micropipette with a polished tip and filled with an electrically conductive solution that has the same composition as extracellular fluids.
7.44.2.4.4.2	When this pipette/electrode is positioned against the membrane of a cell and slight suction is applied, a seal forms.
7.44.2.4.4.3	If a single ion channel (or a few ion channels) are within the patch of membrane bounded by the seal, the openings and closings of individual channels can be recorded by the electrode.
7.44.2.4.4.4	If the pipette is retracted, it can tear the patched membrane away from the cell, and the activities of the ion channels in the patch can continue to be recorded.
7.44.2.5.1.1	The ion channels called leak channels are always open, but other ion channels in the cell membranes of neurons behave as if they contain &#8220;gates&#8221;; they are open under some conditions and closed under other conditions.
7.44.2.5.1.2	Voltage-gated channels open or close in response to a change in the voltage across the cell membrane.
7.44.2.5.1.3	Chemically gated channels open or close depending on the presence or absence of a specific molecule that binds to the channel protein, or to a separate receptor that in turn alters the channel protein.
7.44.2.5.1.4	Mechanically gated channels open or close in response to mechanical force applied to the cell membrane.
7.44.2.5.1.5	Gated channels play important roles in neuronal function.
7.44.2.5.2.1	Openings and closings of gated channels alter the membrane potential.
7.44.2.5.2.2	Above, you considered what would happen if the permeability of the membrane to Na+ suddenly increased.
7.44.2.5.2.3	Such a change in local membrane permeability is generated by the opening of Na+ channels.
7.44.2.5.2.4	Na+ ions would move down their electrochemical gradient until the membrane approaches the equilibrium potential for Na+ (ENa).
7.44.2.5.2.5	Therefore, the inside of the cell becomes less negative.
7.44.2.5.2.6	When the inside of a neuron becomes less negative (or more positive) in comparison to its resting condition, its cell membrane is depolarized (Figure 44.7).
7.44.2.5.2.7	The opposite change in the membrane potential occurs if gated K+ channels open.
7.44.2.5.2.8	Opening of these channels increases the permeability of the cell membrane to K+, and the membrane potential becomes even more negative than when only the leak K+ channels were open, and it is said to be hyperpolarized.
7.44.2.5.2.9	Figure 44.7 Membranes Can Be Depolarized or Hyperpolarized
7.44.2.5.3.1	The openings and closings of ion channels that result in changes in the voltage across the cell membrane are the basic mechanisms by which neurons respond to stimuli, be they electrical, chemical, or mechanical.
7.44.2.5.3.2	How do such local changes in membrane potential get communicated to other parts of the cell?
7.44.2.5.4.1	A local change in membrane potential causes a flow of ions that spreads the change in membrane potential to adjacent regions of the membrane.
7.44.2.5.4.2	For example, when Na+ channels in an axon open making that region of the axon positive, a rapid flow of ionic electric current in the axoplasm causes a decay in that electrical potential change, and it does not spread very far.
7.44.2.6.1.1	The flow of ionic electric current along cell membranes can only extend over a short distance, but it causes a graded change in the local membrane potential.
7.44.2.6.1.2	A graded membrane potential is a change from the resting potential that is proportional to the magnitude of a stimulus.
7.44.2.6.1.3	That stimulus can be chemical or mechanical.
7.44.2.6.1.4	Graded potentials are a means of integrating stimuli because the membrane can respond with proportional amounts of depolarization or hyperpolarization to each stimulus, and those changes in membrane potential are summed.
7.44.2.6.1.5	In the next chapter you will learn how graded potentials play important roles in sensory systems.
7.44.2.6.1.6	However, the spread of graded potentials can only be local and cannot be transmitted down long axons.
7.44.2.6.1.7	Therefore axons code information as discrete APs that travel along their membranes.
7.44.2.6.1.8	Graded potentials, however, play an important role in the generation of APs.
7.44.2.7.1.1	APs are sudden, transient, large changes in membrane potential.
7.44.2.7.1.2	In unmyelinated axons (those not wrapped in myelin by oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells), APs can be conducted at speeds of up to 2 meters per second, but in myelinated axons the conduction velocity can be 100 meters per second.
7.44.2.7.1.3	Think of running the 100-meter dash   the world record is slightly under 10 seconds.
7.44.2.7.2.1	If we place the tips of a pair of electrodes on either side of the cell membrane of a resting axon and measure the voltage difference, the reading might be about    60 mV, as you saw in Figure 44.4.
7.44.2.7.2.2	If these electrodes are in place when an AP travels down the axon, they register a rapid change in membrane potential, from    60 mV to about +50 mV.
7.44.2.7.2.3	The membrane potential then rapidly returns to its resting level of    60 mV (Figure 44.8).
7.44.2.7.2.4	Figure 44.8 The Course of an Action Potential
7.44.2.7.3.1	The AP is generated by the openings and closings of voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels in the cell membrane of the axon.
7.44.2.7.3.2	At the resting potential, most of these channels are closed except for the leak K+ channels (balloon 1 in Figure 44.8).
7.44.2.7.3.3	A slight depolarization of the membrane can cause some voltage-gated Na+ channels to open.
7.44.2.7.3.4	Specifically, if a neuron is stimulated sufficiently to cause the membrane of its cell body to depolarize slightly, that graded potential spreads by local current flow to the axon hillock, the region of the cell body at the base of the axon (see Figure 44.1).
7.44.2.7.3.5	Voltage-gated Na+ channels are concentrated in the axon hillock.
7.44.2.7.3.6	A slight depolarization of the cell membrane in this area causes some of these voltage-gated channels to open briefly   for less than a millisecond (balloon 2 in Figure 44.8).
7.44.2.7.3.7	When these channels open, the increased Na+ permeability depolarizes the membrane even more, causing more Na+ channels to open   a positive feedback effect.
7.44.2.7.3.8	When the membrane is depolarized about 5   10 mV above the resting potential, a threshold is reached; a large number of sodium channels open (balloon 3 in Figure 44.8), and the membrane potential becomes positive   an AP.
7.44.2.7.3.9	The rising phase of the AP halts abruptly in 1   2 milliseconds, and the membrane potential rapidly becomes negative once again.
7.44.2.7.4.1	What causes the axon to return to resting potential?
7.44.2.7.4.2	There are two contributing factors: the voltage-gated Na+ channels close, and voltage-gated K+ channels open (balloon 4 in Figure 44.8).
7.44.2.7.4.3	Voltage-gated K+ channels open in response to the same depolarization that triggered the Na+ channels, but they do so more slowly and they stay open longer, allowing K+ to carry excess positive charges out of the axon.
7.44.2.7.4.4	As a result, the membrane potential returns to a negative value and usually becomes even more negative than the resting potential until the voltage-gated K+ channels close (balloon 5 in Figure 44.8).
7.44.2.7.5.1	Another feature of the voltage-gated Na+ channels is that once they open and close, they have a refractory period of 1   2 milliseconds during which they cannot open again.
7.44.2.7.5.2	This property can be explained by the channels having two gates, an activation gate and an inactivation gate (see Figure 44.8).
7.44.2.7.5.3	Under resting conditions, the activation gate is closed and the inactivation gate is open.
7.44.2.7.5.4	Depolarization of the membrane to the threshold level causes both gates to change state, but the activation gate responds faster.
7.44.2.7.5.5	As a result, the channel is open for a brief time between the opening of the activation gate and the closing of the inactivation gate.
7.44.2.7.5.6	Inactivation gates remain closed for 1   2 milliseconds before they spontaneously open again, thus explaining the refractory period.
7.44.2.7.5.7	By the time the inactivation gate reopens, the activation gate is closed, and the membrane is poised to generate another AP.
7.44.2.7.5.8	Another contribution to the refractory period is the duration of the opening of the voltage-gated K+ channels, as you saw above.
7.44.2.7.5.9	The dip in the membrane potential following an AP is called the after-hyperpolarization or undershoot.
7.44.2.7.6.1	The difference in the concentration of Na+ across the cell membrane and the negative resting potential constitute the &#8220;battery&#8221; that drives APs.
7.44.2.7.6.2	How rapidly does the battery run down?
7.44.2.7.6.3	It might seem that a substantial number of ions would have to cross the membrane for the membrane potential to change from    60 mV to +50 mV and back to    60 mV again.
7.44.2.7.6.4	In fact, only a vanishingly small number of Na+ ions move through the channels during the passage of an active potential.
7.44.2.7.6.5	Thus, the effect of a single action potential on the concentration gradients of Na+ and K+ is very small, and the sodium   potassium pump can keep the &#8220;battery&#8221; charged, even when the neuron is generating many APs every second.
7.44.2.8.1.1	An AP is conducted over long distances with no loss of signal.
7.44.2.8.1.2	If we place two pairs of electrodes at two different locations along an axon, we can record an AP at those two locations as it travels along the axon (Figure 44.9A).
7.44.2.8.1.3	The magnitude of the AP does not change between the two recording sites.
7.44.2.8.1.4	This constancy is possible because an AP is an all-or-none, self-regenerating event.
7.44.2.8.1.5	Figure 44.9 Action Potentials Travel along Axons
7.44.2.8.2.1	An AP is all-or-none because of the interaction between the voltage-gated Na+ channels and the membrane potential.
7.44.2.8.2.2	If the membrane is depolarized slightly, some voltage-gated Na+ channels open.
7.44.2.8.2.3	Some sodium ions cross the cell membrane and depolarize it even more, opening more voltage-gated Na+ channels, and so on, generating an AP.
7.44.2.8.2.4	This positive feedback mechanism ensures that APs always rise to their maximum value.
7.44.2.8.3.1	An AP is self-regenerating because it spreads by local current flow to adjacent regions of the cell membrane.
7.44.2.8.3.2	The resulting depolarization brings those neighboring areas of membrane to threshold.
7.44.2.8.3.3	Therefore, when an AP occurs at one location on an axon, it stimulates the adjacent region of axon to generate an AP, and so on down the length of the axon.
7.44.2.8.3.4	Although we say that the AP travels down the axon, what is really happening is that new APs are being created sequentially.
7.44.2.8.4.1	We can use an electrode to stimulate an axon, causing it to depolarize and to fire an AP that is then conducted along the axon.
7.44.2.8.4.2	Figure 44.9B shows the changes in the ion channels in the membrane that are responsible for conducting the AP along the axon without a reduction in amplitude.
7.44.2.8.4.3	Normally an AP is propagated in only one direction   away from the cell body.
7.44.2.8.4.4	It cannot reverse itself because the voltage-gated Na+ channels in the region of the membrane it came from are in their refractory period (Figure 44.9C).
7.44.2.8.5.1	APs are not conducted at the same speed in all axons.
7.44.2.8.5.2	They travel faster in large-diameter axons than in small-diameter axons because the resistance to ionic current flow decreases as an axon&#8217;s diameter gets bigger.
7.44.2.8.5.3	They travel faster in myelinated than in nonmyelinated axons because they can move down the axon in short &#8220;jumps&#8221; as described in the next section (Figure 44.10).
7.44.2.8.5.4	Invertebrates depend on increased axon diameter for fast conduction, but vertebrates mostly depend on myelination of axons to increase conduction velocity.
7.44.2.8.5.5	Figure 44.10 Saltatory Action Potentials
7.44.2.9.1.1	In vertebrate nervous systems, increasing the speed of APs by increasing the diameter of axons is not feasible because of the huge number of axons involved.
7.44.2.9.1.2	Each of our eyes, for example, has about a million axons connecting it to the brain.
7.44.2.9.1.3	These axons conduct APs at about the same speed as does the squid giant axon   about 20 meters per second   yet the diameter of each is 200 times smaller than the squid axon&#8217;s diameter.
7.44.2.9.1.4	Imagine having optic tracts 200 times bigger.
7.44.2.9.1.5	A different way of increasing conduction velocity of axons has evolved in vertebrates, and that adaptation is myelination.
7.44.2.9.2.1	When glia wrap around axons, they cover the axons with concentric layers of myelin (see Figure 44.3).
7.44.2.9.2.2	However, they leave regularly spaced gaps called nodes of Ranvier, where the axon is not covered (see Figure 44.10).
7.44.2.9.2.3	Underneath the myelin sheaths, there are no Na+ or K+ channels, therefore, APs cannot propagate under the myelin sheath.
7.44.2.9.2.4	However, an AP firing at a node of Ranvier creates a local electrical field inside the axon that spreads almost instantaneously to the next node of Ranvier.
7.44.2.9.2.5	The resulting depolarization of that node triggers another AP, and so on down the axon.
7.44.2.9.2.6	Thus the APs appear to jump from node to node, and their conduction down the axon is very fast.
7.44.2.9.3.1	The speed of conduction is increased in these myelin-wrapped axons because electric current flows much faster through the cytoplasm than ion channels can open and close.
7.44.2.9.3.2	This form of rapid impulse propagation is called saltatory conduction (Latin saltare, &#8220;to jump&#8221;).
7.44.2.9.4.1	Having described how APs are generated and transmitted along axons, we will next address the question of what happens when an AP reaches the axon terminal.
7.44.2.9.4.2	How is its signal communicated to the next cell   which could be another neuron, a muscle cell, or a secretory cell?
7.44.2.9.5.1	44.2 recap
7.44.2.9.6.1	Neurons have membrane potentials due to ion concentration differences across their membranes and the different permeabilities of the membrane to those ions created by ion channels.
7.44.2.9.6.2	Leak channels generate the resting potential, and opening and closing of gated channels can create graded changes in membrane potentials depending on how many of which channel types open or close.
7.44.2.9.6.3	Voltage-gated channels have threshold potentials for opening.
7.44.2.9.6.4	If some voltage-gated Na+ channels open, they create a local depolarization that brings other Na+ channels to threshold   a positive feedback mechanism that generates APs.
7.44.2.9.6.5	Sudden closure of Na+ channels and the opening of K+ channels terminate the AP.
7.44.2.9.6.6	APs are rapid, all-or-none changes in membrane potential that are conducted along axons from the cell body to the axon terminals.
7.44.2.9.6.7	In myelinated axons, APs jump between nodes of Ranvier and conduction is more rapid than in nonmyelinated axons.

7.44.3.11.3	The most common type of synapse in the vertebrate nervous system is the chemical synapse, in which neurotransmitters released from a presynaptic cell induce changes in a membrane potential of a postsynaptic cell.
7.44.3.11.4	This section begins with a discussion of the synapses between neurons and muscle cells.
7.44.3.11.5	We then consider the diversity in synapses between neurons and how they integrate information.
7.44.3.12.1	focus your learning
7.44.3.13.1	Action potentials arriving at a chemical synapse such as the neuromuscular junction trigger an influx of Ca2+ that activates the molecular machinery responsible for vesicular release of neurotransmitter.
7.44.3.14.1	Gap junctions are comprised of connexins connecting electrically-coupled neurons through a pore, enabling ions and small molecules to cross from one cell to another.
7.44.3.15.1	The action of a neurotransmitter depends on the nature of the postsynaptic receptor.
7.44.3.16.1	Neurotransmitter action can be terminated by diffusion, reuptake, or degradation.
7.44.3.17.1	Agonists and antagonists are drugs that target specific receptors.
7.44.3.1.1.1	Neuromuscular junctions are synapses between neurons and skeletal muscle cells.
7.44.3.1.1.2	They are excellent models for how chemical synaptic transmission works.
7.44.3.1.1.3	Neurons that control muscles are called motor neurons.
7.44.3.1.1.4	Like other neurons, a motor neuron has only one axon, but that axon can branch into numerous axon terminals that form many synapses with muscle cells.
7.44.3.1.1.5	At each axon terminal an enlarged knob or buttonlike structure contains membrane-bound vesicles filled with neurotransmitter molecules.
7.44.3.1.1.6	The neurotransmitter used by all vertebrate neuromuscular synapses is acetylcholine (ACh).
7.44.3.1.1.7	ACh is released by exocytosis when the membrane of a vesicle containing this neurotransmitter fuses with the presynaptic membrane of the axon terminal.
7.44.3.1.2.1	The postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction is a modified part of the muscle cell membrane called a motor end plate.
7.44.3.1.2.2	It appears as a depression in the muscle cell membrane, and the terminals of the motor neuron sit in the depression.
7.44.3.1.2.3	The space between the presynaptic membrane and the postsynaptic membrane is the synaptic cleft, which in chemical synapses is about 20   40 nanometers wide.
7.44.3.1.2.4	ACh released into the cleft by the presynaptic cell diffuses across to the postsynaptic membrane (Focus: Key Figure 44.11).
7.44.3.1.3.1	focus: key figure
7.44.3.1.4.1	Figure 44.11 Chemical Synaptic Transmission Begins with the Arrival of an Action Potential
7.44.3.1.5.1	The neuromuscular junction is a typical chemical synapse.
7.44.3.1.5.2	Events shown here are similar for other neurotransmitters at other synapses.
7.44.3.1.5.3	Both chemically gated and voltage gated ACh receptors are found in the motor end plate.
7.44.3.1.5.4	These are non-selective cation channels, but are more permeable to Na+ than to K+ (inset).
7.44.3.1.5.5	When one of the chemically gated receptors binds ACh, its channel pore opens and the net increase in Na+ permeability of the postsynaptic membrane depolarizes it.
7.44.3.1.5.6	The depolarization spreads beyond the motor endplate activating voltage gated Na+ channels in the muscle cell membrane, depolarizing it and initiating an action potential.
7.44.3.1.5.7	The enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) breaks down ACh in the synapse, closing the chemically gated channels.
7.44.3.1.5.8	The breakdown products (acetate and choline) are taken up by the presynaptic membrane and resynthesized into more ACh.
7.44.3.1.6.1	Q: If this synapse were between neurons, and the neurotransmitter were inhibitory rather than excitatory, what chemically gated channels would you expect to be on the postsynaptic membrane?
7.44.3.2.1.1	Neurotransmitter is released when an AP arrives at the axon terminal and causes the opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the presynaptic membrane.
7.44.3.2.1.2	Because the Ca2+ concentration is greater outside the cell than inside, Ca2+ enters the axon terminal.
7.44.3.2.1.3	This increase in Ca2+ inside the axon terminal causes the vesicles containing neurotransmitter to fuse with the presynaptic membrane and empty their contents into the synaptic cleft.
7.44.3.2.2.1	In neuromuscular synapses, vesicle fusion and emptying is all-or-none.
7.44.3.2.2.2	The vesicle membrane is incorporated into the presynaptic membrane, which actually gets larger as a result   at least until the extra membrane is recycled through endocytosis.
7.44.3.2.2.3	The membrane is reprocessed by the cell into new vesicles that are refilled with neurotransmitter.
7.44.3.3.1.1	Our description of the release of neurotransmitter from the presynaptic membrane may seem simple, but it involves hundreds of proteins that are responsible for various aspects of the process: vesicle formation, transport of neurotransmitter into vesicles, anchoring of vesicles to cytoskeletal elements, docking of the vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, fusion of the vesicular and cell membranes, and endocytosis of the vesicle membrane for recycling.
7.44.3.3.2.1	Some of these proteins are the targets of toxins.
7.44.3.3.2.2	For example, botulinum and tetanus toxins from bacteria of the genus Clostridium act on several of the proteins necessary for the docking of vesicles to the presynaptic membrane, resulting in diseases that are frequently fatal.
7.44.3.3.2.3	Botulinum toxin impairs muscle contraction, whereas tetanus toxin causes uncontrolled muscle contraction.
7.44.3.3.2.4	Poisons can become medicines.
7.44.3.3.2.5	Botulinum toxin (in the form of Botox) is used therapeutically to subdue muscle spasms and cosmetically to reduce wrinkles.
7.44.3.4.1.1	When acetylcholine is released at a synapse, some of it diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to ACh receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.
7.44.3.4.1.2	The postsynaptic membrane of the motor end plate is highly folded.
7.44.3.4.1.3	ACh receptors are on the crests of the folds, and voltage-gated cation channels are at the bottoms of the folds and in the surrounding muscle cell membrane (see Figure 44.11).
7.44.3.4.1.4	The ACh receptors are gated channels that allow both Na+ and K+ to flow through, but since the electrochemical gradients favor a net influx of Na+, the response of the motor end plate to ACh is to depolarize.
7.44.3.4.1.5	That graded potential reflects the number of receptors activated.
7.44.3.4.1.6	If sufficient numbers of receptors are activated, the membrane depolarization spreads to the depths of the folds of the motor end plate membrane and to the surrounding muscle cell membrane, which contain voltage-gated Na+ channels.
7.44.3.4.2.1	The spreading depolarization of the motor end plate activates the voltage-gated Na+ channels and causes the firing of an AP.
7.44.3.4.2.2	This AP is then conducted throughout the muscle cell&#8217;s system of membranes, causing the cell to contract.
7.44.3.4.2.3	We will discuss the contraction of muscle cells in greater detail in Key Concept 47.10.
7.44.3.4.3.1	How much neurotransmitter is enough?
7.44.3.4.3.2	Neither a single ACh molecule nor the contents of an entire vesicle (about 10,000 ACh molecules) will bring the membrane of a muscle cell to threshold.
7.44.3.4.3.3	However, a single AP in an axon terminal releases the contents of about 100 vesicles   more than enough to fire an AP in the muscle cell and cause it to contract.
7.44.3.5.1.1	The synapses between vertebrate motor neurons and muscle cells are always excitatory.
7.44.3.5.1.2	The motor end plates always respond to ACh with a graded potential that is less negative than the resting potential (depolarization).
7.44.3.5.1.3	However, synapses between neurons are frequently inhibitory; such a synapse causes hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane or simply makes it less likely that membrane potential will reach threshold for the voltage gated Na+ channels.
7.44.3.5.1.4	For example, there are more Cl    ions outside than inside the cell.
7.44.3.5.1.5	However, in a mammalian neuron the equilibrium potential for Cl    is around    60mV.
7.44.3.5.1.6	Given a resting potential that is also around    60 mV, opening of Cl    channels will not hyperpolarize the membrane, but if these channels are open, it will make it more difficult to raise the membrane potential to the threshold for the voltage gated Na+ channels.
7.44.3.5.2.1	Recall that most neurons have many dendrites.
7.44.3.5.2.2	Axon terminals from many other neurons can form synapses with those dendrites and with the cell body.
7.44.3.5.2.3	The axon terminals of different presynaptic neurons can store and release different neurotransmitters, and the cell membrane of the dendrites and cell body of a postsynaptic neuron can have receptors for a variety of neurotransmitters.
7.44.3.5.2.4	The mix of synaptic activity impinging on a neuron will cause it to have a graded membrane potential that can be either more positive or more negative than its resting potential.
7.44.3.6.1.1	What determines when an individual neuron will fire an AP?
7.44.3.6.1.2	As you just learned, the sum of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials creates a graded membrane potential in the postsynaptic cell body.
7.44.3.6.1.3	This summation ability is the major mechanism by which the nervous system integrates information.
7.44.3.6.1.4	A neuron may receive 1,000 or more synaptic inputs, but it has only one output: APs in a single axon.
7.44.3.6.1.5	At any one time, the information from all of the active inputs is translated into the rate at which that neuron generates APs in its axon.
7.44.3.6.2.1	For most neurons, summation takes place in the axon hillock at the base of the axon.
7.44.3.6.2.2	The cell membrane of the axon hillock is not insulated by glia and has many voltage-gated Na+ channels.
7.44.3.6.2.3	Excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials from synapses anywhere on the dendrites or the cell body spread to the axon hillock by local current flow.
7.44.3.6.2.4	If the resulting graded potential depolarizes the axon hillock to threshold, it fires an AP.
7.44.3.6.2.5	Because postsynaptic potentials decrease in strength as they spread from the site of the synapse, a synapse at the tip of a dendrite has less influence than a synapse on the cell body, near the axon hillock.
7.44.3.6.2.6	Figure 44.12 The Postsynaptic Neuron Sums Information
7.44.3.6.3.1	Excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are summed over space and over time.
7.44.3.6.3.2	Spatial summation adds up the simultaneous influences of synapses at different sites on the postsynaptic cell (Figure 44.12A).
7.44.3.6.3.3	Temporal summation adds up postsynaptic potentials generated at the same site in a rapid sequence (Figure 44.12B).
7.44.3.7.1.1	Electrical synapses are different from chemical synapses because they couple neurons electrically.
7.44.3.7.1.2	Electrical synapses contain numerous *gap junctions.
7.44.3.7.1.3	At these synapses, the presynaptic and postsynaptic cell membranes are separated by a space of only 2   3 nanometers, and membrane proteins called connexins link the two neurons by forming pores that connect the cytoplasm of the two cells (see Figure 7.16A).
7.44.3.7.1.4	Electrical current as well as ions and small molecules can pass directly from cell to cell through these pores.
7.44.3.7.1.5	As a result, transmission at electrical synapses is very fast and can proceed in either direction.
7.44.3.7.1.6	In comparison, transmission at chemical synapses is slow and unidirectional.
7.44.3.7.2.1	*connect the concepts The proteins that form gap junctions between cells, including neurons, are discussed in Key Concept 6.2.
7.44.3.7.3.1	The properties of electrical synapses make them especially well adapted for processes that have to be fast   for example, escape from danger.
7.44.3.7.3.2	They are also effective means of achieving synchronous activity of populations of cells.
7.44.3.7.3.3	Electrical synapses are less common in the nervous systems of vertebrates than are chemical synapses.
7.44.3.7.3.4	The major reason is that they offer fewer means for integration of information.
7.44.3.7.3.5	Electrical synapses are almost exclusively excitatory whereas chemical synapses are both excitatory and inhibitory.
7.44.3.7.3.6	Electrical synapses are not well suited for temporal summation of inputs.
7.44.3.7.3.7	Also, because of their relative simplicity of structure and function, electrical synapses offer fewer possible mechanisms for plasticity which is the foundation of learning and memory.
7.44.3.7.3.8	One advantage they do have is the ability to synchronize large numbers of cells.
7.44.3.8.1.1	More than 100 neurotransmitters are now recognized, and more will surely be discovered.
7.44.3.8.1.2	Acetylcholine (ACh) is an important neurotransmitter because it is the substance the nervous system uses in signaling muscles to contract.
7.44.3.8.1.3	ACh also plays roles in certain synapses between neurons in the brain, but it accounts for only a small percent of the total neurotransmitter content of the brain.
7.44.3.8.2.1	The workhorse neurotransmitters of the brain are three simple amino acids: glutamate, which is usually excitatory, and glycine and &#947;-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which are usually inhibitory.
7.44.3.8.2.2	The integration of information at the cellular level is a balance between excitation and inhibition, so it is understandable that excessive inhibition such as you saw in the Down syndrome mice described at the start of this chapter could impair an animal&#8217;s ability to process and integrate new information.
7.44.3.8.2.3	Indeed, when GABA&#8217;s inhibitory action in these mice was reduced by a drug that blocks the GABA receptor, the learning ability of the mice improved, as described in Investigating Life: Can Learning Be Restored in Mouse Models of Down Syndrome?

7.44.3.8.7.1	If the learning disability in the mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) is due to overinhibition, then reducing the activity of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, might improve learning in these mice.
7.44.3.8.8.1	HYPOTHESIS The inability of DS model mice to learn and remember experiences as well as wild-type (WT) mice is due to overactive GABA signaling in their brains.
7.44.3.8.8.2	If GABA signaling is reduced, the ability of mice to perform learning tasks should improve.
7.44.3.8.9.1	METHOD
7.44.3.8.10.1	Keep DS and WT mice of the same age on a 12-hour:12-hour light   dark cycle.
7.44.3.8.10.2	At the same time each morning, for 2 weeks, inject the mice in the experimental group with the drug pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), which blocks the action of GABA.
7.44.3.8.10.3	Use three different doses.
7.44.3.8.10.4	Inject the control mice with saline.
7.44.3.8.10.5	The doses are measured as mg PTZ/kg body weight of mouse.
7.44.3.8.11.1	Following completion of the two-week drug-dosing protocol, evaluate the mice using the Novel Object Recognition (NOR) test.
7.44.3.8.11.2	For training, place each mouse in a 4-square-foot arena that contains two objects such as chessmen or small bottles.
7.44.3.8.11.3	Allow the mouse to explore the objects for 10 min and then return it to its home cage.
7.44.3.8.11.4	An acceptable baseline is when the mouse spends the same amount of time exploring each object.
7.44.3.8.11.5	Test again 1 day later, placing the mouse back in the arena but with one of the objects changed (the novel object).
7.44.3.8.11.6	If the mouse spends more time exploring the novel object, that is evidence that it remembered the original object from the day before.
7.44.3.8.12.1	Quantify the mouse&#8217;s behavior as a NOR preference (time spent exploring object A/time spent exploring objects A and B &#215; 100%).
7.44.3.8.12.2	For the testing trial, A is the novel object.
7.44.3.8.12.3	A NOR preference of 50% means the mouse spent equal amounts of time with each object, and therefore did not remember the objects it explored previously.
7.44.3.8.12.4	A NOR preference significantly greater than 50% means the mouse spent more time exploring the novel object and is evidence that the mouse remembered the objects it saw before.
7.44.3.8.13.1	RESULTS
7.44.3.8.14.1	Data are NOR preference pecentages &#177; 1 SEM (standard error of the mean).
7.44.3.8.14.2	An asterisk (*) indicates P &lt; 0.01 for difference between training (blue) and testing (orange) results as determined by a t-test: **, P &lt; 0.001.
7.44.3.8.15.1	CONCLUSION
7.44.3.8.16.1	The saline treatments (controls) show that the WT mice can recognize the novel object 24 hr after training and that the DS mice cannot.
7.44.3.8.16.2	PTZ treatment had no effect on the WT mice.
7.44.3.8.16.3	PTZ treatment at 0.3 and 0.03 mg/kg improved the ability of the DS mice to remember the familiar objects and therefore recognize the novel object, whereas treatment at 0.01 mg/kg did not.
7.44.3.8.17.1	work with the data
7.44.3.8.18.1	All of the PTZ injections in the experiment described above were given to the mice early in the light phase of their day.
7.44.3.8.18.2	This is the time when these nocturnal animals are normally sleeping.
7.44.3.8.18.3	The researchers therefore asked whether the same results could be obtained if the treatments were delivered during the dark phase of the day, when the mice are usually active and exploring.
7.44.3.8.18.4	They obtained the following data: Treatment Group Saline PTZ 0.3 mg/kg WT Mice Training 55.0 &#177; 3.1 55.4 &#177; 2.4 DS Mice Training 51.9 &#177; 2.4 50.7 &#177; 2.0 WT Mice Testing 65.8 &#177; 5.3* 67.4 &#177; 4.9* DS Mice Testing 53.7 &#177; 4.7 51.3 &#177; 6.9
7.44.3.8.19.1	QUESTIONS
7.44.3.8.20.1	How does the learning ability of the WT and DS mice compare during the dark phase of the day, and does this result differ from when the training and testing are done during the light phase?
7.44.3.8.21.1	Describe any difference between the effect of the PTZ treatment on the performance of the WT and DS mice on the NOR task during the light and dark phases of the day.
7.44.3.8.22.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.44.3.8.23.1	Another important group of neurotransmitters in the brain is the monoamines, which are derivatives of amino acids.
7.44.3.8.23.2	They include dopamine and norepinephrine (derivatives of tyrosine) and serotonin (a derivative of tryptophan).
7.44.3.8.23.3	Peptides also function as neurotransmitters; for example, endorphins and enkephalins are the body&#8217;s opiates and modulate the sensation of pain.
7.44.3.8.23.4	Another peptide, substance P, transmits pain sensations.
7.44.3.8.23.5	Even a gas, nitric oxide, is used by neurons as an intercellular messenger (see Figure 7.13).
7.44.3.8.24.1	Neurotransmission is complex in part because each neurotransmitter has multiple receptor types.
7.44.3.8.24.2	ACh, for example, has two receptor types: nicotinic receptors and muscarinic receptors.
7.44.3.8.24.3	All of the ACh receptors in skeletal muscle are nicotinic.
7.44.3.8.24.4	Both types of ACh receptors are found in the brain and spinal cord, where nicotinic receptors tend to be excitatory and muscarinic receptors tend to be inhibitory.
7.44.3.8.24.5	ACh actions can differ outside the brain and spinal cord as well.
7.44.3.8.24.6	ACh acting through nicotinic receptors causes the smooth muscle of the gut to increase its motility, but ACh acting through muscarinic receptors causes cardiac muscle to hyperpolarize and therefore to slow down.
7.44.3.8.24.7	There are many more examples of neurotransmitters that have different effects in different tissues, but the important thing to remember is that the action of a neurotransmitter depends on the receptor to which it binds.
7.44.3.8.24.8	In addition, turning neurotransmitter action off is as important as turning it on.
7.44.3.9.1.1	If released neurotransmitter molecules simply remained in the synaptic cleft, the postsynaptic membrane would become saturated and receptors would be constantly activated.
7.44.3.9.1.2	The postsynaptic cell would remain hyperpolarized or depolarized and would be unresponsive additional APs arriving at the presynaptic cell.
7.44.3.9.1.3	The more rapidly neurons can respond to input, the more information they can process in a given amount of time.
7.44.3.9.1.4	Thus neurotransmitter must be cleared from the synaptic cleft shortly after it is released by the axon terminal.
7.44.3.9.2.1	Neurotransmitter action can be terminated in several ways.
7.44.3.9.2.2	First, enzymes can destroy the neurotransmitter.
7.44.3.9.2.3	Acetylcholine, for example, is rapidly destroyed by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is present in the synaptic cleft in close association with ACh receptors on the postsynaptic membrane (see Figure 44.12).
7.44.3.9.2.4	When AChE is inhibited, ACh lingers in the synaptic cleft, causing spastic (contracted) muscle paralysis and usually resulting in death.
7.44.3.9.2.5	Some of the most deadly nerve gases developed for chemical warfare work by inhibiting AChE.
7.44.3.9.2.6	Some agricultural insecticides, such as malathion, also inhibit AChE and can poison farm workers if used without safety precautions.
7.44.3.9.3.1	Neurotransmitter can also simply diffuse away from the cleft or be taken back up by the presynaptic membrane to be recycled.
7.44.3.9.3.2	Glial cells also take up neurotransmitters.
7.44.3.9.3.3	An antidepressant drug commonly prescribed under the brand name Prozac slows the reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin, thus enhancing serotonin&#8217;s activity at the synapse.
7.44.3.10.1.1	Many drugs used to treat the nervous system act by modulating specific synaptic interactions.
7.44.3.10.1.2	Drugs that mimic or potentiate the effect of a neurotransmitter are called agonists; those that block the actions of neurotransmitters are called antagonists.
7.44.3.10.1.3	For example, morphine is an agonist at the endorphin receptor and therefore blocks pain.
7.44.3.10.1.4	Propranolol, a widely used beta blocker, is an antagonist of receptors in the fight-or-flight response and therefore decreases panic attacks and anxiety.
7.44.3.10.1.5	A major emphasis in neurobiology is to identify neurotransmitter receptor subtypes and design drugs that selectively bind to them to have highly specific effects on nervous system activity.
7.44.3.10.2.1	44.3 recap
7.44.3.10.3.1	Chemical synapses involve the release of neurotransmitter molecules stored in vesicles in the presynaptic terminal.
7.44.3.10.3.2	APs reaching that terminal cause the fusion of vesicles with the presynaptic membrane, releasing neurotransmitter that can then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane and influence its membrane potential.
7.44.3.10.3.3	At excitatory synapses, the neurotransmitter causes depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, and at inhibitory synapses the neurotransmitter hyperpolarizes or stabilizes the postsynaptic membrane potential.
7.44.3.10.3.4	There is a great diversity of neurotransmitters and their receptors.
7.44.3.10.3.5	At electrical synapses the AP moves directly between pre- and postsynaptic cells.
7.44.3.10.4.1	learning outcomes
7.44.3.10.5.1	You should be able to:
7.44.3.10.6.1	Describe the events at a neuromuscular synapse, beginning with the action potential in the presynaptic neuron and ending with the response of the postsynaptic cell.
7.44.3.10.7.1	Compare the characteristics of electrical versus chemical synapses.
7.44.3.10.8.1	Discuss how the properties of transmission differ for electrical and chemical synapses, and why chemical synapses present a greater variety of postsynaptic responses than do electrical synapses.
7.44.3.10.9.1	Discuss how the properties of chemical synapses present a variety of postsynaptic responses.
7.44.3.10.10.1	Describe the reasons why synaptic transmission is typically transitory.
7.44.3.10.11.1	What are the two types of cation channels in the motor end plate, and what are their functions?
7.44.3.10.12.1	How can the same neurotransmitter be excitatory to some postsynaptic neurons and inhibitory to others?
7.44.3.10.13.1	Sarin is a colorless, odorless liquid that is highly lethal.
7.44.3.10.13.2	It irreversibly inhibits the enzyme acetylcholinesterase.

7.44.3.10.14.1	Explain why parts of nervous systems that integrate complex information use chemical rather than electrical synapses.
7.44.3.10.15.1	Now that you understand how neurons communicate with each other, we will explore how they are organized into circuits and systems that process sensory information and generate responses to that information.
7.44.3.10.16.1	Chapter 44 continues with
7.44.3.10.17.1	44.4 Neurons and Glia Form Information-Processing Circuits
7.44.4.1.1	Nervous systems range in complexity
7.44.4.2.1	Reflexes are controlled by simple circuits involving sensory neurons, interneurons, and effectors
7.44.4.3.1	The vertebrate brain is the seat of behavioral complexity
7.44.4.4.1	Nervous systems can process information because their neurons are organized into neural networks.
7.44.4.4.2	These networks include three functional categories of neurons that are responsible for input, output, and integration:
7.44.4.5.1	Afferent neurons carry sensory information into the nervous system.
7.44.4.5.2	That information comes from specialized sensory cells that transduce (convert) various kinds of sensory stimuli (e. g. , light, heat, pressure) into APs.
7.44.4.6.1	Efferent neurons carry commands to physiological and behavioral effectors such as muscles and glands.
7.44.4.7.1	Interneurons integrate and store information and communicate between afferent and efferent neurons.
7.44.4.8.1	focus your learning
7.44.4.9.1	From invertebrates to vertebrates, nervous systems have evolved with increasing complexity from simple nerve nets to clusters of neurons (ganglia) to the development of anterior brain structures.
7.44.4.10.1	The knee-jerk reflex involves a simple circuit with input from sensory neurons stimulating interneurons and motor neurons in the spinal cord that trigger the quadriceps to contract.
7.44.4.1.1.1	Simple animals such as cnidarians (sea anemones, for example) process information with a limited number of simple neural networks that do little more than provide direct lines of communication from sensory cells to effectors; there is little or no integration or processing of signals (Figure 44.13A).
7.44.4.1.1.2	The cnidarian&#8217;s nerve net is most developed around the tentacles and the oral opening, where it facilitates detection of food or danger and causes tentacles to extend or retract.
7.44.4.1.1.3	Figure 44.13 Nervous Systems Vary in Size and Complexity
7.44.4.1.2.1	Animals that are more complex and move about in search of food and mates must process and integrate larger amounts of information.
7.44.4.1.2.2	Even earthworms fit this description, and their increased need for information processing is met by higher numbers of neurons organized into clusters of neuronal cell bodies called ganglia (singular ganglion).
7.44.4.1.2.3	Ganglia serving different functions may be distributed around the body, as in earthworms (Figure 44.13B).
7.44.4.1.2.4	In animals that are bilaterally symmetrical, ganglia frequently come in pairs, one on each side of the body (Figure 44.13C).
7.44.4.1.2.5	Also, as animals increase in complexity, some ganglia may become enlarged or fused together at the anterior end, forming a brain.
7.44.4.1.2.6	Small nervous systems of invertebrates can be remarkably complex.
7.44.4.1.2.7	Consider the nervous systems of spiders that have programmed within them the thousands of precise movements necessary to construct an intricate web without prior experience or opportunities to learn the specific web architecture of their species.
7.44.4.1.3.1	In vertebrates, most cells of the nervous system are found in the central nervous system (CNS).
7.44.4.1.3.2	The CNS includes the brain and the spinal cord, which are the sites of most information processing, storage, and retrieval (Figure 44.13D).
7.44.4.1.3.3	Information is transmitted from sensory cells to the CNS and from the CNS to cells that respond (effectors) via neurons that extend or reside outside the brain and the spinal cord.
7.44.4.1.3.4	These sensory and effector neurons and their supporting cells are the peripheral nervous system.
7.44.4.2.1.1	A reflex is a behavioral or physiological response that does not require conscious information processing   it is autonomic, meaning an involuntary or unconscious reaction.
7.44.4.2.1.2	Examples are salivating at the sight or smell of food, and the jerk of your lower leg when a physician taps your knee with a small rubber hammer.
7.44.4.2.1.3	The knee-jerk reflex involves a very simple neural circuit involving just a few neurons that connect with each other in the spinal cord.
7.44.4.2.1.4	Thus it is called a spinal reflex.
7.44.4.2.1.5	A cross section of the human spinal cord reveals a central area of gray matter in the shape of a butterfly, surrounded by areas of white matter (see Figure 44.14).
7.44.4.2.1.6	In the nervous system, gray matter is rich in neuronal cell bodies, and white matter contains myelinated axons.
7.44.4.2.1.7	The gray matter of the spinal cord contains the cell bodies of the spinal neurons; the white matter contains myelinated axons that conduct information up and down the spinal cord.
7.44.4.2.1.8	Figure 44.14 A Neural Network in the Spinal Cord Generates the Knee-Jerk Reflex
7.44.4.2.2.1	Spinal nerves extend from the spinal cord at regular intervals on each side.
7.44.4.2.2.2	Each spinal nerve has two roots, one connecting with the dorsal horn of the gray matter, the other with the ventral horn.
7.44.4.2.2.3	The afferent (sensory) axons in a spinal nerve enter the spinal cord through the dorsal root, and the efferent (motor) axons leave through the ventral root.
7.44.4.2.2.4	The neural circuit of the knee-jerk reflex is diagrammed in Figure 44.14.
7.44.4.2.2.5	The tap of the physician&#8217;s rubber hammer stretches the tendon going over the knee.
7.44.4.2.2.6	That tendon attaches the muscle of the upper leg to bone in the lower leg.
7.44.4.2.2.7	Stretching the tendon stretches muscle fibers in the upper leg, and stretch receptors in that muscle transduce the physical stimulus into APs.
7.44.4.2.2.8	The APs are then conducted by a sensory neuron into the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.
7.44.4.2.2.9	That sensory neuron goes all the way to the ventral horn and synapses onto a motor neuron, which fires APs.
7.44.4.2.2.10	The axon of that motor neuron travels out through the ventral horn of the spinal cord and extends all the way to the same muscle that initially was stretched, causing that muscle to contract.
7.44.4.2.3.1	What is the function of the spinal knee-jerk reflex?
7.44.4.2.3.2	This simple circuit senses increased load on a muscle and adjusts its level of contraction to match the load.
7.44.4.2.3.3	Most spinal reflexes are more complex.
7.44.4.2.3.4	For example, limb movement is controlled by antagonistic sets of muscles that work against each other.
7.44.4.2.3.5	When one member of an antagonistic set of muscles contracts, it bends (flexes) the limb; it is therefore called a flexor.
7.44.4.2.3.6	The antagonist muscle, the extensor, straightens (extends) the limb.
7.44.4.2.3.7	For a limb to move, one muscle of the pair must relax while the other contracts.
7.44.4.2.3.8	Thus sensory input that activates the motor neuron of one muscle also inhibits its antagonist.
7.44.4.2.3.9	This coordination is achieved by an interneuron between the sensory neuron and the motor neuron of the antagonist muscle (see Figure 44.15).
7.44.4.2.3.10	Thus the reciprocal inhibition of antagonistic muscles involves at least two synapses.
7.44.4.2.4.1	The withdrawal reflex is an example of a polysynaptic spinal reflex that involves many interneurons.
7.44.4.2.4.2	When you step on a tack, you immediately pull back your foot, but you don&#8217;t fall over because many other muscles change your posture.
7.44.4.2.4.3	The tack stimulates pain receptors in the foot, and the sensory neurons transmit APs into the dorsal horn of the spinal cord on the same side of the body.
7.44.4.2.4.4	In the dorsal horn, these neurons synapse with a variety of interneurons.
7.44.4.2.4.5	Some send the pain information through their axons to the brain, resulting in the conscious sensation of pain.
7.44.4.2.4.6	But even before the brain is aware of the pain, other interneurons coordinate the withdrawal of the foot with actions of other muscles to shift your weight onto the other leg.
7.44.4.2.4.7	Thus a rather complex suite of movements is coordinated by a network of interneurons in the spinal cord.
7.44.4.2.4.8	By extension, you can appreciate how much more complex the neural networks are that enable you to execute complex movements in time with music and coordinated with another person   in other words, to dance.
7.44.4.3.1.1	Vertebrates differ greatly in their behavioral complexity and in their physiological specializations, and their neural networks reflect this diversity.
7.44.4.3.1.2	Figure 44.15 shows the brains of four vertebrate species of similar body mass drawn to the same scale.
7.44.4.3.1.3	Figure 44.15 Brains Vary in Size and Complexity
7.44.4.3.2.1	The human nervous system contains an estimated 1011 neurons.
7.44.4.3.2.2	A given neuron in the brain can have 1,000 or more synapses.
7.44.4.3.2.3	Thus the human brain can contain 1014 synapses (1011 neurons &#215; 103 synapses per neuron).
7.44.4.3.2.4	Then there are the glia.
7.44.4.3.2.5	A single astrocyte might participate in 100,000 synapses while at the same time monitoring signals in the extracellular fluid and the blood.
7.44.4.3.2.6	In addition, synapses are not constant but can be highly plastic.
7.44.4.3.2.7	They can increase or decrease in number and size, and they can become more or less sensitive.
7.44.4.3.3.1	This astronomical number of neurons and synapses is divided into thousands of distinct but interacting networks that function in parallel.
7.44.4.3.3.2	The possible number of informational networks in the brain is almost infinite, and therein lies the incredible ability of the human brain to process information, to learn, to do complex tasks, to remember, and to have emotions.
7.44.4.3.4.1	44.4 recap
7.44.4.3.5.1	Nervous systems are composed of neural networks that include afferent neurons, interneurons, and efferent neurons.
7.44.4.3.5.2	Nervous systems range in complexity from simple nerve nets to the human brain.
7.44.4.3.5.3	The spinal knee-jerk reflex is an example of a simple neural network, but networks that control more complex behavior are much more complicated.
7.44.4.3.6.1	learning outcomes
7.44.4.3.7.1	You should be able to:
7.44.4.3.8.1	Distinguish the central from the peripheral nervous system and recognize how these systems range in complexity among different species.
7.44.4.3.9.1	Analyze a simple circuit and map the communication between afferent and efferent neurons.
7.44.4.3.10.1	What are ganglia, and why are they concentrated in the anterior region of many invertebrates?
7.44.4.3.11.1	Draw or describe the flow of information from stimulus to response in the knee-jerk reflex circuit.
7.44.4.3.12.1	In the knee-jerk reflex circuit, how can the same stimulus cause contraction in one muscle and relaxation in another?
7.44.4.3.13.1	When considering fish, then reptiles, then mammals, which part of the vertebrate brain increases most in size?
7.44.4.3.14.1	investigatinglife
7.44.4.3.15.1	Can learning be restored in mouse models of Down syndrome?
7.44.4.3.16.1	Some neurotransmitter   receptor combinations excite activity in the postsynaptic neuron, depolarizing it and making it likely to fire an AP.
7.44.4.3.16.2	Other neurotransmitter   receptor combinations inhibit the responses of the postsynaptic cell.
7.44.4.3.16.3	Neurons integrate information by summing excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs.
7.44.4.3.16.4	Over- inhibition in the nervous system can arise when too much inhibitory neurotransmitter (such as GABA) is released, or if postsynaptic cells have too many receptors for inhibitory neurotransmitters.
7.44.4.3.16.5	Drugs that decrease the synthesis and release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter can reduce the inhibition, as can drugs that block the receptors for such neurotransmitters.
7.44.4.3.16.6	In the case of the Down syndrome model mice, drugs such as pentylenetetrazole, which blocked the GABA receptors (which function also as Cl    channels), reduced the level of inhibition in the mouse nervous system and increased the ability of the mice to learn and form memories.
7.44.4.3.17.1	Future directions
7.44.4.3.18.1	Going from experiments on the effects of drugs on mice to a therapy for humans is a difficult path.
7.44.4.3.18.2	To protect patients, the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has a rigorous procedure for approving drugs for human use.
7.44.4.3.18.3	After a candidate drug is shown to be effective and safe in animal models, four stages of approval must be passed before a drug is allowed on the market.
7.44.4.3.18.4	In Phase 0, the first in-human trials are conducted on a small group of volunteers to study how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes the drug, and whether it has any obvious side effects.
7.44.4.3.18.5	In Phase 1, trials are conducted in a small group of volunteers to evaluate safety and dosage, and again to look for side effects.
7.44.4.3.18.6	Phase 2 involves a larger group of subjects who have the disease that the drug is expected to treat, to see if it is effective and safe.
7.44.4.3.18.7	The comparison is with a placebo.
7.44.4.3.18.8	In Phase 3, trials are conducted with a large group of patients to assess the drug&#8217;s effectiveness and safety, and to compare it with other commonly used treatments.
7.44.4.3.18.9	Each of these phases must be reviewed by the FDA and approved before proceeding to the next phase.
7.44.4.3.18.10	Pentylenetetrazole is currently in Phase 2 trials.

7.44.4.3.20.1	Chapter Summary
7.44.summary.1.1	44.1
7.44.summary.2.1	Neurons and Glia Are Unique Cells of Nervous Systems
7.44.summary.3.1	The cells of the nervous systems include many types of neurons and glia.
7.44.summary.4.1	All neurons can generate and conduct ionic electrical signals, and most can generate action potentials (APs).
7.44.summary.4.2	Glia support and modulate the activities of neurons but do not generate APs .
7.44.summary.5.1	A neuron generally receives information via its dendrites, of which there can be many, and transmits information via its single axon, which ends in axon terminals.
7.44.summary.5.2	Review Figures 44.1, 44.2
7.44.summary.6.1	Where neurons and their target cells meet, information is transmitted across specialized junctions called synapses.
7.44.summary.7.1	Glia include Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes, both of which generate myelin sheaths on axons.
7.44.summary.7.2	Review Figure 44.3
7.44.summary.8.1	Glia also include astrocytes, which support neurons metabolically, modulate synaptic signaling, and contribute to the blood   brain barrier.
7.44.summary.9.1	44.2 Neurons Generate and Transmit Electric Signals
7.44.summary.10.1	Neurons have an electric charge difference across their cell membranes.
7.44.summary.10.2	This membrane potential is generated by ion gradients (due to ion transporters) and ion channels.
7.44.summary.10.3	When a neuron is not stimulated, its membrane potential is referred to as the resting potential.
7.44.summary.10.4	Review Figure 44.4, Animation 44.1
7.44.summary.11.1	The sodium   potassium pump concentrates K+ on the inside of a neuron and Na+ on the outside.
7.44.summary.11.2	Leak K+ channels in the cell membrane allow K+ to diffuse out leaving behind unbalanced negative charges, creating the resting potential.
7.44.summary.11.3	Review Figure 44.5
7.44.summary.12.1	Patch clamping allows the study of single ion channels.
7.44.summary.12.2	Review Figure 44.6
7.44.summary.13.1	The resting potential is perturbed when ion channels open or close, changing the permeability of the cell membrane to charged ions.
7.44.summary.13.2	Through this mechanism, the cell membrane can become depolarized or hyperpolarized and therefore have a graded membrane potential response to input.
7.44.summary.13.3	Review Figure 44.7
7.44.summary.14.1	An AP is a rapid transient reversal in charge across a portion of the cell membrane resulting from the sequential opening and closing of voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels.
7.44.summary.14.2	These changes in voltage-gated channels occur when the cell membrane depolarizes to a threshold level.
7.44.summary.14.3	Review Figure 44.8, Animation 44.2
7.44.summary.15.1	APs are all-or-none, self-regenerating events.
7.44.summary.15.2	They are conducted down axons because local current flow depolarizes adjacent regions of membrane and brings them to threshold.
7.44.summary.15.3	Review Figure 44.9
7.44.summary.16.1	In myelinated axons, APs appear to jump between nodes of Ranvier, areas of axonal cell membrane that are not covered by myelin.
7.44.summary.16.2	Review Figure 44.10
7.44.summary.17.1	44.3 Neurons Communicate with Other Cells
7.44.summary.18.1	Neurons communicate with each other and with other cell types by transmitting information over electrical synapses or by the transmission of molecular signals called neurotransmitters over chemical synapses.
7.44.summary.19.1	The neuromuscular junction is a well-studied chemical synapse between a motor neuron and a skeletal muscle cell.
7.44.summary.19.2	Its neurotransmitter is acetylcholine (ACh), which causes depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane when it binds to its receptor at the motor end plate.
7.44.summary.19.3	Review Focus: Key Figure 44.11, Animation 44.3
7.44.summary.20.1	When an AP reaches an axon terminal, it causes the release of neurotransmitters, which diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.
7.44.summary.20.2	See Activity 44.1
7.44.summary.21.1	Synapses between neurons can be either excitatory or inhibitory.
7.44.summary.21.2	A postsynaptic neuron integrates information by summing excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials both spatially and temporally.
7.44.summary.21.3	Review Figure 44.12
7.44.summary.22.1	There are many different neurotransmitters and even more types of receptors.
7.44.summary.22.2	The action of a neurotransmitter depends on the type of receptor to which it binds.
7.44.summary.22.3	See Activity 44.2
7.44.summary.23.1	Neurotransmitter molecules cannot be allowed to accumulate in a synapse but must be cleared to turn off responses in the postsynaptic cell.
7.44.summary.23.2	This may be done by enzymatic degradation, simple diffusion, or reuptake of the neurotransmitter.
7.44.summary.24.1	44.4 Neurons and Glia Form Information-Processing Circuits
7.44.summary.25.1	In vertebrates, the brain and spinal cord form the central nervous system (CNS), which communicates with the rest of the body via the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
7.44.summary.25.2	The CNS increases in complexity from invertebrates to vertebrates and from fish to mammals.
7.44.summary.25.3	Review Figures 44.14, 44.15
7.44.summary.26.1	Neural networks include afferent neurons and efferent neurons, generally connected through interneurons.
7.44.summary.27.1	A spinal reflex is an example of a simple neural network that integrates information and controls a response.

7.44.summary.34.3	Nature 450: 420   424.
7.44.summary.35.1	A common question in neurobiology is whether or not neurons in a particular brain region control a specific physiological or behavioral response in the animal.
7.44.summary.35.2	Recording neural activity with electrodes may show a correlation between activity of the neurons and the response, but that does not prove that those neurons control the response.
7.44.summary.35.3	The best evidence for whether specific neurons control a specific response is obtained by stimulating the activity of the neurons and observing   and thus proving   that the stimulation results in the response.
7.44.summary.36.1	Dr. Karl Deisseroth&#8217;s lab at Stanford University developed a means of activating specific neurons with light.
7.44.summary.36.2	They called their method &#8220;optogenetics. &#8221; Algae have light-sensitive ion channels in their membranes.
7.44.summary.36.3	The scientists isolated the gene for one of these ion channels, rhodopsin (ChR2), and developed methods to modify the gene so that when it was introduced by viral infection into a specific brain area, it would be expressed only in the neurons of interest.
7.44.summary.36.4	Using this technique, the researchers introduced ChR2 into a specific group of cells in mouse brains that produce the neurotransmitter hypocretin.
7.44.summary.36.5	They also implanted optical fibers into the brains of these mice so they could shine light on these neurons and activate them.
7.44.summary.36.6	They hypothesized that these hypocretin-releasing neurons coordinated wakefulness.
7.44.summary.37.1	Using electrodes, the scientists recorded the action potentials of the hypocretin neurons when they were stimulated with light.
7.44.summary.37.2	Figure A shows the response of a neuron to 1 second of light, and Figure B shows the response to 15-millisecond pulses of light.
7.44.summary.37.3	Each figure superimposes two trials.
7.44.summary.37.4	Figure A Figure B
7.44.summary.38.1	The researchers recorded sleep and wakefulness in the mice, and they stimulated the hypocretin neurons when the mice were asleep.
7.44.summary.38.2	The control mice received the same viral infection treatment, but the virus did not include the ChR2 gene.
7.44.summary.38.3	The time between the stimulation and the animal awakening (sleep-to-wake latency) was determined for different stimulation frequencies.
7.44.summary.38.4	They repeated the same experiment in mice that were expressing the ChR2 gene but were injected with saline or high and low does of a drug that blocked the hypocretin receptor (HctR).
7.44.summary.38.5	Figure C shows the results of 15-ms light pulses over 10 seconds (1-30 Hz) and continuous light illumination for 10 seconds (ON).

7.45.1.1	The &#x201C;holes&#x201D; below the eyes of this rattlesnake are the pit organs that detect infrared radiation from the snake&#x2019;s preferred prey&#x2014;small rodents&#x2014;with precision, even in total darkness.

7.45.7.1	investigatinglife
7.45.8.1	Seeing in the Dark
7.45.9.1	A rattlesnake can see to strike a running rodent in complete darkness.
7.45.9.2	How can this be, when &#x201C;seeing&#x201D; means using the eyes to detect light waves, and &#x201C;complete darkness&#x201D; means no light?
7.45.9.3	It is possible because these definitions are based on human capabilities.
7.45.9.4	What we call &#x201C;light&#x201D; is actually only a small portion (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet) of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation.
7.45.9.5	Other animals see wavelengths humans cannot.
7.45.9.6	Some insects, for example, perceive patterns on flowers that reflect ultraviolet wavelengths invisible to humans (see Figure 28.15).
7.45.9.7	Similarly, rattlesnakes &#x201C;see&#x201D; infrared wavelengths that we cannot (although at high enough levels of intensity, humans feel infrared wavelengths as heat).
7.45.10.1	It is not the snake&#x2019;s eyes that perceive infrared light.
7.45.10.2	Pit vipers, rattlesnakes, and their relatives have pit organs located between the nostril and the eye on each side of the skull that contain high densities of infrared-sensitive neurons.
7.45.10.3	The two pits are positioned in such a way that sensory receptor cells in the pits receive directional information.
7.45.10.4	Information from the pit organs goes to the same region of the brain as information from the eyes, so rattlesnakes actually do &#x201C;see&#x201D; the world in a range of electromagnetic radiation that is different from the human visual spectrum.
7.45.11.1	Our definition of silence is as human-oriented as our definition of darkness. &#x201C;Sound&#x201D; is actually pressure waves in the environment, and many animals are sensitive to pressure waves with frequencies, or pitches, we cannot hear.
7.45.11.2	Elephants communicate using sound waves that are below human hearing range; such long waves travel great distances, an advantage to large animals that roam over extensive areas.
7.45.11.3	Bats emit incredibly loud, brief sound pulses that are above our range of hearing.
7.45.11.4	A flying bat hears echoes of these pulses bouncing off objects in the environment and can therefore avoid obstacles and catch prey in total darkness.
7.45.12.1	&#x201C;Reality&#x201D; is what our eyes see, our ears hear, our noses smell, and what we touch and taste.
7.45.12.2	Humans sense only a limited range of the information available.
7.45.12.3	Animals with different ranges of sensitivity process different sources of information and perceive the world quite differently than we do.
7.45.12.4	A challenge for neurobiologists is to understand how neurons are adapted to detect different types of information in the environment.
7.45.13.1	How do pit vipers &#x201C;see&#x201D; in the dark?
7.45.14.1	Chapter 45 continues with
7.45.15.1	45.1  Sensory Receptor Cells Convert Stimuli into Action Potentials
7.45.1.1.1	Sensory transduction involves changes in membrane potentials
7.45.1.2.1	Sensory receptor proteins act on ion channels
7.45.1.3.1	Sensation depends on which neurons receive action potentials from sensory cells
7.45.1.4.1	Many receptors adapt to repeated stimulation
7.45.1.5.1	Sensory receptor cells, usually called sensors or receptors, transduce (convert) physical and chemical stimuli such as light and sound waves, pressure (e. g. , touch), and odorant and taste molecules into neural signals.
7.45.1.5.2	These signals are then transmitted to the central nervous system (CNS) for processing and interpretation.
7.45.1.5.3	The first step in this process of sensory transduction is a change in the membrane potential of the receptor cell in response to a specific type of stimulus.
7.45.1.6.1	focus your learning
7.45.1.7.1	Specific stimuli cause changes in membrane potentials of sensory cells.
7.45.1.8.1	Sensory receptors act directly or indirectly on ion channels in the cell membrane.
7.45.1.9.1	Responses to sensory information depend on the neural circuits they activate.
7.45.1.10.1	Receptors can adapt to constant stimulation.
7.45.1.1.1.1	Sensory transduction typically begins with a receptor protein that opens or closes ion channels in response to a specific stimulus such as heat, light, chemicals, mechanical force, or electric fields.
7.45.1.1.1.2	The resulting change in membrane permeability to ions alters the receptor cell&#x2019;s membrane potential.
7.45.1.1.1.3	A change in the membrane potential of a receptor cell in response to a stimulus is a receptor potential.
7.45.1.1.1.4	Receptor potentials are graded membrane potentials that spread over only short distances.
7.45.1.1.1.5	To signal over long distances in the nervous system, receptor potentials must generate action potentials, which they can do in two ways:
7.45.1.1.2.1	The receptor potential may trigger action potentials in the receptor cell itself.
7.45.1.1.3.1	The receptor potential may cause the receptor cell to release neurotransmitters that induce a postsynaptic neuron to generate action potentials.
7.45.1.1.4.1	A good model of how a receptor cell generates action potentials is the stretch receptor of a crayfish (Figure 45.1).
7.45.1.1.4.2	Stretching the muscle to which the stretch receptor is attached causes receptor potentials.
7.45.1.1.4.3	These receptor potentials spread to the base of the cell&#x2019;s axon, where they generate action potentials that travel down the axon to the CNS.
7.45.1.1.4.4	The rate at which action potentials are fired depends on the magnitude of the receptor potential; that magnitude, in turn, depends on how much the muscle is stretched.
7.45.1.1.4.5	Figure 45.1 Stimulating a Sensory Cell Produces a Receptor Potential
7.45.1.1.5.1	In a receptor cell that does not fire action potentials (such as the photoreceptors in the vertebrate eye), the spreading receptor potential reaches a presynaptic patch of cell membrane and induces the release of a neurotransmitter.
7.45.1.1.5.2	The intensity of the stimulus influences how much neurotransmitter is released.
7.45.1.1.5.3	That neurotransmitter binds to receptor proteins on an associated sensory neuron, altering its membrane potential and causing it to increase or decrease its rate of firing action potentials.
7.45.1.1.5.4	In a few cases, this second cell also does not generate action potentials, but simply changes the rate at which it releases neurotransmitter onto another neuron.
7.45.1.1.5.5	Eventually, however, the stimulation of a sensory cell is always coded as a change in firing of action potentials in a sensory circuit.
7.45.1.2.1.1	Sensory receptor proteins respond to stimuli by directly or indirectly opening or closing ion channels in the sensory cell (Figure 45.2), leading either to an action potential or to the release of neurotransmitter.
7.45.1.2.1.2	Those sensory receptor proteins that act directly on membrane potential are either ion channels themselves or directly affect the opening of an associated ion channel.
7.45.1.2.1.3	Examples are receptors that respond to physical force (mechanoreceptors) and those that respond to temperature (thermoreceptors).
7.45.1.2.1.4	Electroreceptors do not have receptor proteins, but their cell membranes are sensitive to voltage changes and respond to depolarization by opening voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and the Ca2+ triggers neurotransmitter release.
7.45.1.2.1.5	Sensory receptor proteins that influence ion channels indirectly usually do so by activating G proteins and second messengers, as described in Key Concepts 7.2 and 7.3.
7.45.1.2.1.6	Examples are most chemoreceptors and photoreceptors.
7.45.1.2.1.7	Figure 45.2 Sensory Cell Membrane Receptor Proteins Respond to Stimuli
7.45.1.2.2.1	A recently discovered superfamily of receptor proteins is the focus of considerable research in an effort to identify the molecular mechanisms by which infrared signals are detected.
7.45.1.2.2.2	Transient receptor potential (TRP) channel proteins generate a large initial response to a stimulus and then gradually fade even as the stimulus remains constant.
7.45.1.2.2.3	Seven classes of TRP channels have been identified, along with about 28 different molecular structures.
7.45.1.2.2.4	Each type of TRP channel is specialized to respond to a different stimulus, such as stretch, pressure, temperature, light, and certain chemicals.
7.45.1.2.2.5	Some respond to both physical and chemical stimuli, such as one that responds to heat, capsaicin (an active ingredient in chili peppers), and wasabi.
7.45.1.2.2.6	Could a heat-sensitive TRP channel be responsible for the infrared-detection function of the pit organs of rattlesnakes?
7.45.1.2.2.7	You will pursue this question in Investigating Life: How Do Pit Vipers &#x201C;See&#x201D; in the Dark?
7.45.1.3.1.1	All sensory systems process information in the form of action potentials.
7.45.1.3.1.2	But the sensations we perceive&#x2014;heat, pressure, light, smell, sound&#x2014;differ because the messages from different kinds of sensory cells arrive at different places in the CNS.
7.45.1.3.1.3	Action potentials arriving in the visual cortex of the brain are interpreted as light, whereas those that arrive in the olfactory bulb are perceived as smells.
7.45.1.3.2.1	A small patch of skin on your arm contains some sensory receptor cells that increase their firing rates when the skin is warmed and others that increase their activity when the skin is cooled.
7.45.1.3.2.2	Other sensory cells in the same patch of skin respond to touch, irritants such as insect bites, and painful stimuli.
7.45.1.3.2.3	These receptor cells transmit their messages through axons that enter the CNS at the spinal cord.
7.45.1.3.2.4	The synapses made by those axons in the spinal cord and the subsequent pathways of transmission determine whether the stimulation of the skin on your arm is perceived as warmth, cold, touch, itch, or pain; even though the action potentials carried by all of these sensory axons are the same, the connectivity of each axon is specific for a given sensory modality.
7.45.1.3.2.5	The intensity of a given sensation is coded by the frequency of the action potentials.
7.45.1.3.3.1	Some sensory receptors transmit information about the body&#x2019;s internal conditions of which we are not consciously aware.
7.45.1.3.3.2	The brain continuously receives information about body temperature, the concentrations of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the blood, arterial pressure, muscle tension, and the position of the limbs.
7.45.1.3.3.3	All of this information is important for homeostasis but does not necessarily result in conscious sensation.
7.45.1.3.4.1	Some sensory receptor cells are assembled with other types of cells into sensory organs, such as eyes, ears, and noses, that enhance the ability of sensory cells to collect, filter, and amplify stimuli.
7.45.1.3.4.2	Sensory systems include the sensory cells, their associated organs, and the neural networks that process the information.
7.45.1.4.1.1	Some sensory receptor cells give gradually diminishing responses to maintained or repeated stimulation.
7.45.1.4.1.2	This phenomenon, known as sensory adaptation, enables an animal to ignore background or unchanging conditions while remaining sensitive to changes and new information.
7.45.1.4.1.3	(Note that this use of the term &#x201C;adaptation&#x201D; is different from its application in an evolutionary context. )
7.45.1.4.1.4	When you get dressed, you feel each item of clothing touch your skin, but the sensation of clothes touching your skin is not constantly on your mind throughout the day.
7.45.1.4.1.5	You are immediately aware of new sensations, however, such as your shoe coming untied or someone touching your back.
7.45.1.4.2.1	Some sensory receptor cells adapt very little or very slowly; examples are some types of pain receptors and the mechanoreceptors that control balance.
7.45.1.4.2.2	You do not want to ignore pain, which usually is signaling that something is wrong in your body, and to maintain equilibrium you must continuously know (albeit unconsciously) the tensions and forces on all of your joints and muscles.

7.45.1.4.6.3	Nature 464: 1006&#x2013;1012.
7.45.1.4.7.1	Neurons of the pit organ have their cell bodies in a neural ganglion in the head&#x2014;the trigeminal ganglion (TG).
7.45.1.4.7.2	Sensory neurons conducting information from the body of the snake have their cell bodies in neural ganglia associated with the spinal cord&#x2014;the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs).
7.45.1.4.7.3	Any receptor protein that is involved in sensing heat by the pit organ or by temperature sensors in the skin should be expressed in the TG or the DRGs, respectively.
7.45.1.4.8.1	HYPOTHESIS Different transient receptor potential (TRP) channel proteins responsive to heat are expressed in the TG and the DRGs, and they have different properties.
7.45.1.4.9.1	METHOD
7.45.1.4.10.1	Many neurons in the TG of rattlesnakes innervate the pit organs, and therefore the RNA transcripts for any protein that is abundant in the pit organ nerve endings should be highly expressed in the TG.
7.45.1.4.10.2	Similarly, RNA transcripts for sensory receptor proteins in the skin of the body should be highly expressed in the DRGs.
7.45.1.4.10.3	Whole genome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to create the RNA profiles of the TG and the DRGs of the rattlesnake.
7.45.1.4.10.4	Of particular interest were specific TRP RNA reads (specific RNA sequences) that were differentially expressed in the TG and the DRGs.
7.45.1.4.10.5	If there are more reads for a certain TRP channel in the TG versus the DRGs, that TRP channel might play a role in the pit organ&#x2019;s ability to sense infrared radiation.
7.45.1.4.10.6	Because the range of read values was so large, the data are plotted as logarithmic values (log&#x2013;log plot).
7.45.1.4.11.1	RESULTS
7.45.1.4.12.1	CONCLUSIONS
7.45.1.4.13.1	TRPV1 and &#x201C;Other TRPs&#x201D; are expressed equally in the TG and the DRGs, so they probably are not responsible for the unique infrared-sensing properties of the pit organ.
7.45.1.4.14.1	TRPA1 is expressed more in the TG than in the DRGs.
7.45.1.4.14.2	This channel could therefore serve a unique function in the pit organ.
7.45.1.4.15.1	work with the data
7.45.1.4.16.1	The data from the experiment comparing TRP channel expression in the TG and the DRGs support the conclusion that the TRPA1 channel could be the infrared (IR) sensor in the pit organ.
7.45.1.4.16.2	Another piece of evidence would be finding that the TRPA1 gene is not highly expressed in the TG of snakes without pit organs, or that it is highly expressed in snakes not closely related to rattlesnakes but that have pit organs.
7.45.1.4.16.3	Accordingly, the investigators performed RNA-seq analysis of the TG and the DRGs of rat snakes (no pits) and pythons (pits).

7.45.1.4.21.1	Explain how these results do or do not support the conclusion that the TRPA1 channel is the IR sensor in the pit organ.

7.45.1.4.23.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.45.1.4.24.1	45.1 recap
7.45.1.4.25.1	Sensory receptor cells have receptor proteins that respond to specific stimuli from the external or internal environment by directly or indirectly opening or closing ion channels, causing the generation of action potentials or neurotransmitter release in sensory neurons.
7.45.1.4.25.2	How the resulting information is processed and interpreted depends on the neural circuitry that is activated.
7.45.1.4.26.1	learning outcomes
7.45.1.4.27.1	You should be able to:
7.45.1.4.28.1	Describe the roles of receptor potentials and action potentials in sensory systems.
7.45.1.4.29.1	Explain how the same membrane event, an action potential, can result in sensations of heat, light, sound, touch, or taste.
7.45.1.4.30.1	Describe the various ways that environmental stimuli can generate receptor potentials.
7.45.1.4.31.1	Explain the functional significance of sensory adaptation.
7.45.1.4.32.1	In the crayfish stretch receptor, what creates the receptor potential?
7.45.1.4.32.2	Where and how does it stimulate an action potential?
7.45.1.4.33.1	How are we able to perceive action potentials&#x2014;all of which are essentially the same&#x2014;as different sensations?
7.45.1.4.34.1	Peppers have a distinctive flavor, but they also can be hot if they contain the molecule capsaicin.
7.45.1.4.34.2	Explain the difference in how the flavor versus the hotness of a pepper is sensed.
7.45.1.4.35.1	Why is adaptation or the lack thereof important in different sensory modalities?
7.45.1.4.36.1	Now that you have a general view of how sensory systems code and process information, you will next learn how sensory systems gather and filter stimuli, transduce specific stimuli into action potentials, and transmit action potentials to the CNS, which perceives them as different types of information.

7.45.1.4.38.1	45.2 Chemoreceptors Respond to Specific Molecules
7.45.2.1.1	Olfaction is the sense of smell
7.45.2.2.1	Some chemoreceptors detect pheromones
7.45.2.3.1	The vomeronasal organ contains chemoreceptors
7.45.2.4.1	Gustation is the sense of taste
7.45.2.5.1	A colony of corals responds to a small amount of meat extract in seawater by extending its coral polyps and their tentacles in search of food; a solution of a single type of amino acid can stimulate this response.
7.45.2.5.2	Conversely, a small amount of seawater in which corals were crushed will stimulate a defensive retraction of the coral polyps.
7.45.2.5.3	Humans also react strongly to certain chemical stimuli.
7.45.2.5.4	When you smell freshly baked bread you salivate and feel hungry, and when you smell rotting meat you feel nauseated.
7.45.2.6.1	focus your learning
7.45.2.7.1	Many different chemoreceptors can be activated in different combinations and to different degrees, enabling discrimination of an enormous number of odorant and pheromone molecules.
7.45.2.8.1	Five classes of taste chemoreceptors have different mechanisms of membrane depolarization.
7.45.2.9.1	All animals receive information about chemical stimuli through chemoreceptors, which are receptor proteins that bind to specific molecules&#x2014;their ligands&#x2014;and are responsible for smell and taste.
7.45.2.9.2	Chemoreceptors are also responsible for monitoring some aspects of the internal environment, such as the level of carbon dioxide in the blood.
7.45.2.1.1.1	The sense of smell, olfaction, depends on chemoreceptors.
7.45.2.1.1.2	In vertebrates the olfactory receptors are neurons embedded in a layer of epithelial tissue in the uppermost region of the nasal cavity (Figure 45.3).
7.45.2.1.1.3	The dendrites of these neurons project as olfactory cilia on the surface of the nasal epithelium, and their axons extend through holes in the overlying bone into the olfactory bulb (the olfactory integration area of the brain).
7.45.2.1.1.4	A protective layer of mucus covers the nasal cavity epithelium.
7.45.2.1.1.5	Molecules from the environment must diffuse through this mucus to reach the receptor proteins on the olfactory cilia.
7.45.2.1.1.6	When you have a cold, the amount of mucus in your nose increases, and the epithelium swells.
7.45.2.1.1.7	With this in mind, you can easily understand why respiratory infections can cause you to lose your sense of smell.
7.45.2.1.2.1	Figure 45.3 Olfactory Receptors Communicate Information Directly to the Brain
7.45.2.1.3.1	An odorant is a molecule in the environment that binds to and activates an olfactory receptor protein on the cilia of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs).
7.45.2.1.3.2	Different olfactory receptor proteins bind specific subsets of odorant molecules.
7.45.2.1.3.3	An odorant molecule binding to its receptor on an ORN activates a * G protein.
7.45.2.1.3.4	The G protein then activates an enzyme that causes an increase of a second messenger (cAMP in vertebrates) in the cytoplasm.
7.45.2.1.3.5	The second messenger binds to and opens cation channels in the ORN&#x2019;s cell membrane, causing an influx of Na+ into the ORN&#x2014;which then depolarizes to threshold and fires action potentials.
7.45.2.1.3.6	An interesting feature of ORNs is that they are continuously regenerated.
7.45.2.1.3.7	Because they are embedded in nasal epithelium that, like other epithelial linings, is regularly shed, ORNs have to be constantly replaced.
7.45.2.1.4.1	* connect the concepts Key Concept 7.2 describes how G protein-coupled receptors transmit signals from a variety of stimuli outside a cell to its interior.
7.45.2.1.4.2	Ligand binding of the receptor activates the G protein on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane, which&#x2014;if bound by GTP&#x2014;will activate an effector.
7.45.2.1.5.1	The olfactory world has an enormous number of odors and a correspondingly large number of olfactory receptor proteins.
7.45.2.1.5.2	In the 1990s Linda Buck and Richard Axel discovered a family of about 1,000 genes in mice (about 3 percent of the mouse genome) that code for olfactory receptor proteins.
7.45.2.1.5.3	Each receptor protein that is expressed is found in a limited number of ORNs in the olfactory epithelium, and each ORN expresses just one receptor type.
7.45.2.1.5.4	The investigators matched specific gene products with the odorants they detect.
7.45.2.1.5.5	For their discoveries of the molecular nature of the olfactory system, Buck and Axel received a Nobel Prize in 2004.
7.45.2.1.6.1	Olfactory sensitivity enables discrimination of many more odorants than there are olfactory receptors.
7.45.2.1.6.2	An odorant molecule can be quite complex, and different regions of that molecule may bind to different receptor proteins.
7.45.2.1.6.3	The next stage of processing olfactory information is in the olfactory bulb, where axons from ORNs expressing the same receptor protein cluster together on olfactory bulb neurons, forming structures called glomeruli (see Figure 45.3).
7.45.2.1.6.4	A complex odorant molecule can activate a unique combination of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, so an olfactory system with hundreds of different receptor proteins can discriminate an astronomically large number of smells.
7.45.2.1.6.5	The more odorant molecules that bind to ORNs, the greater the frequency of action potentials and thus the greater the intensity of the perceived smell.
7.45.2.1.7.1	Humans have a sensitive olfactory system, but in comparison with most mammals we depend far more on vision than on olfaction.
7.45.2.1.7.2	The nasal epithelium of a typical dog is 15&#x2013;20 times larger than a human&#x2019;s and has about 300 million odorant receptors, compared with about 6 million in the average human.
7.45.2.1.7.3	For some scents, the threshold sensitivity of the dog is 100,000 times lower; a dog&#x2019;s nose reveals a huge amount of information not available to people.
7.45.2.2.1.1	A specialized type of chemical signal used for communication among conspecifics (individuals of the same species) is called a pheromone.
7.45.2.2.1.2	Individual animals secrete pheromone molecules into the environment, triggering behavioral responses in other individuals of the species.
7.45.2.2.1.3	Pheromones may communicate alarm signals, mark food trails, or define territories, among many other uses.
7.45.2.2.1.4	Their function in mating and mate attraction especially illustrates the remarkable sensitivity of chemosensory systems, and the silkworm moth Bombyx mori is an extensively studied example.
7.45.2.2.2.1	To attract a mate, the female silkworm moth releases a pheromone called bombykol from a gland at the tip of her abdomen (Figure 45.4A).
7.45.2.2.2.2	The male silkworm moth has about 10,000 receptors for this molecule on each of his feathery antennae (Figure 45.4B).
7.45.2.2.2.3	A single molecule of bombykol may be sufficient to generate action potentials in the antennal nerve, which transmits the signal to the male&#x2019;s CNS.
7.45.2.2.2.4	The extreme sensitivity of the male bombykol receptors ensures that the sexual message sent by a female moth is likely to reach any male within a huge downwind area.
7.45.2.2.2.5	The rate of firing in the male&#x2019;s sensory nerves is proportional to the concentration of bombykol in the air, so by flying upwind he can follow an airborne concentration gradient to &#x201C;home in&#x201D; on the signaling female.
7.45.2.2.3.1	Figure 45.4 Pheromones Can Communicate over Great Distances
7.45.2.2.4.1	Q: Molecules have different diffusion coefficients.
7.45.2.2.4.2	Bombykol has a high diffusion coefficient.
7.45.2.2.4.3	How do you think its diffusion coefficient would compare with that of a territory-marking pheromone, and why might they be different?
7.45.2.3.1.1	The vomeronasal organ (VNO) is a small, paired tubular structure embedded in the nasal epithelium of amphibians, reptiles, and many mammals (although not humans).
7.45.2.3.1.2	In mammals the VNO is located on the septum dividing the two nostrils (see Figure 52.3) and has a pore that opens into the nasal cavity.
7.45.2.3.1.3	The VNO pulsates and draws a sample of nasal fluid over the chemoreceptors embedded in its walls.
7.45.2.3.1.4	The information from these chemoreceptors goes to an accessory olfactory bulb in the brain, and from there to brain regions involved in sexual and other instinctive behaviors.
7.45.2.3.1.5	The VNO of a rodent detects pheromones that signal the sex, strain, identity, and sexual receptivity of another individual.
7.45.2.3.2.1	In snakes the VNO opens into the roof of the mouth cavity.
7.45.2.3.2.2	Each time the snake&#x2019;s forked tongue darts in and out, the forks fit into the VNO openings and present the chemoreceptors located there with a sample of molecules from the surrounding air (see the chapter opening photo).
7.45.2.3.2.3	Thus the snake uses its tongue to smell its environment, not to taste it.
7.45.2.3.2.4	Why doesn&#x2019;t the snake simply use the flow of air to and from its lungs, as we do, to smell the environment?
7.45.2.3.2.5	In snakes, air flows to and from the lungs slowly (and can even stop entirely for long periods of time), but the tongue can dart in and out rapidly.
7.45.2.3.2.6	It is a quick source of olfactory information used in social communication and hunting prey.
7.45.2.4.1.1	In humans and other vertebrates, the sense of taste, gustation, depends on clusters of chemoreceptors called taste buds.
7.45.2.4.1.2	The taste buds of terrestrial vertebrates are confined to the mouth cavity, but some fish have taste buds in the skin that enhance their ability to sense their environment.
7.45.2.4.1.3	Some fish living in murky water are very sensitive to small amounts of amino acids in the water and can find food without the use of vision.
7.45.2.4.1.4	The duck-billed platypus, a prototherian mammal (see Figure 32.26B), has similar talents as a result of taste buds on the sensitive skin of its bill.
7.45.2.4.2.1	The human tongue has 5,000&#x2013;10,000 taste buds embedded in the epithelium.
7.45.2.4.2.2	Most of them are found on the sides of the papillae (Figure 45.5).
7.45.2.4.2.3	(Look at your tongue in a mirror&#x2014;the papillae make it look fuzzy. )
7.45.2.4.2.4	The outer surface of a taste bud has a pore that exposes the tips of the sensory receptor cells.
7.45.2.4.2.5	Microvilli (tiny hairlike projections) increase the surface area of these cells where their tips converge at the pore.
7.45.2.4.2.6	These chemoreceptor cells generate action potentials and release neurotransmitter at their bases, where they form synapses with sensory neurons that convey the signals to the CNS.
7.45.2.4.2.7	Figure 45.5 Taste Buds Are Clusters of Sensory Cells
7.45.2.4.3.1	The tongue does a lot of hard work, so its epithelium, along with cells of its taste buds, are shed and replaced at a rapid rate.
7.45.2.4.3.2	Individual taste bud cells last about 10 days before they are replaced, but the sensory neurons associated with them live on, constantly forming new synapses as new taste buds form.
7.45.2.4.4.1	Gustation begins with the membrane receptor proteins of the microvilli of the taste bud sensory cells (see Figure 45.5).
7.45.2.4.4.2	Humans perceive five taste classes: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami.
7.45.2.4.4.3	However, taste buds can distinguish among a variety of sweet-tasting molecules and a variety of bitter-tasting molecules.
7.45.2.4.4.4	Umami is a savory, meaty taste that is stimulated by amino acids, including monosodium glutamate (MSG), a commonly used flavor enhancer.
7.45.2.4.4.5	Sweet, bitter, and umami tastes are the functions of a small family of G protein-coupled TRP channels.
7.45.2.4.4.6	Other TRP channels related to the ones you saw associated with heat sensation in Investigating Life: How Do Pit Vipers &#x201C;See&#x201D; in the Dark? are responsible for spicy/hot tastes.
7.45.2.4.4.7	Still other TRP channels that act as cold sensors are activated by minty, cool-tasting foods.
7.45.2.4.4.8	Saltiness receptor proteins allow Na+ to diffuse into taste bud sensory cells through open Na+ channels, depolarizing the sensory cell.
7.45.2.4.4.9	Sourness receptors are activated by a direct effect of H+ ions on Na+ channels.
7.45.2.4.5.1	Various selective pressures led to the evolution of diversity in gustatory receptors.
7.45.2.4.5.2	Receptors for bitter tastes may have evolved as protective mechanisms enabling animals to detect toxic plant compounds such as quinine, caffeine, and nicotine.
7.45.2.4.5.3	Because many such toxic compounds evolved in plants as protections against herbivorous predators, having a variety of receptors in those herbivores is a product of the continuous &#x201C;arms race&#x201D; between predators and prey (see Key Concept 55.1).
7.45.2.4.5.4	Also, a large number of molecules in food could indicate nutritional value, so a variety of receptors is of value.
7.45.2.4.5.5	The diversity of sweet receptors helps explain why it has been possible to invent many chemically distinct artificial sweeteners.
7.45.2.4.6.1	Regardless of the mechanism of taste transduction by the receptors of the taste buds, all these cells release neurotransmitter onto sensory neurons.
7.45.2.4.6.2	These neurons then generate action potentials that are conducted to the CNS, where they are interpreted as specific taste sensations.
7.45.2.4.6.3	The full complexity of the chemosensitivity that enables us to enjoy the subtle flavors of food comes from the combined activation of gustatory and olfactory receptors, which is why you may lose your sense of taste when you have a cold.
7.45.2.4.7.1	45.2 recap
7.45.2.4.8.1	All animals receive information about chemical stimuli through chemoreceptors, which have diverse structures and bind to a tremendous variety of ligands.
7.45.2.4.8.2	Chemoreceptors are the basis of the sensations of olfaction and gustation and the reception of pheromones.
7.45.2.4.8.3	They also monitor some aspects of an animal&#x2019;s internal environment.
7.45.2.4.9.1	learning outcomes
7.45.2.4.10.1	You should be able to:
7.45.2.4.11.1	Describe how a large but limited number of olfactory receptor proteins can discriminate a much larger number of odorant molecules, as well as their concentrations.
7.45.2.4.12.1	Explain how the five classes of taste receptors generate action potentials in their sensory neurons.
7.45.2.4.13.1	Different odorants have different cell surface receptors, but these receptors activate the same intracellular G protein signaling pathway.
7.45.2.4.13.2	How does the olfactory system discriminate different odors?
7.45.2.4.14.1	How does the olfactory system discriminate between the whiff of a skunk, a repulsive odor of skunk, and the smell of a skunk cabbage?
7.45.2.4.15.1	The concentration thresholds for sensing bitter tastes are lower than for salt or sweet.
7.45.2.4.15.2	Offer an evolutionary explanation for why this is so.
7.45.2.4.16.1	With only five classes of taste receptors, how can we discriminate so many different tastes?
7.45.2.4.17.1	You have now seen how chemoreceptors give rise to the sensations of smell and taste, and how some animals use chemoreception to communicate with others of their species.
7.45.2.4.17.2	Next we describe the sensory cells that respond to mechanical forces, including the vibrations you perceive as sound.

7.45.2.4.19.1	45.3 Mechanoreceptors Respond to Physical Forces
7.45.3.1.1	Many different receptor cells respond to touch and pressure
7.45.3.2.1	Mechanoreceptors are also found in muscles, tendons, and ligaments
7.45.3.3.1	Hair cells are mechanoreceptors of the auditory and vestibular systems
7.45.3.4.1	Auditory systems use hair cells to sense sound waves
7.45.3.5.1	Flexion of the basilar membrane is perceived as sound
7.45.3.6.1	Various types of damage can result in hearing loss
7.45.3.7.1	The vestibular system uses hair cells to detect forces of gravity and momentum
7.45.3.8.1	The cell membranes of mechanoreceptors have cation channels that open when the membrane is disturbed by physical forces.
7.45.3.8.2	The intensity of the physical force is registered as a graded receptor potential, which in turn leads to either the release of neurotransmitter or the generation of action potentials.
7.45.3.8.3	The amount of neurotransmitter release or the rate of action potentials tells the CNS the strength of the stimulus to the mechanoreceptor.
7.45.3.8.4	A diversity of mechanoreceptor cells has evolved in different sensory systems.
7.45.3.8.5	The functions of these cells range from interpreting skin sensations to sensing blood pressure to hearing and maintaining balance.

7.45.3.10.1	A variety of pressure-sensitive receptors enable multiple modes of mechanosensation.
7.45.3.11.1	Stretch receptors in muscle spindles signal for contraction, and stretch receptors in tendons signal for relaxation.
7.45.3.12.1	As the frequency of the sound stimulus decreases, the stimulated region of the basilar membrane moves from basal to apical.
7.45.3.13.1	The ear converts sound waves in air to pressure waves in fluid that bend hair cells to create auditory sensation.
7.45.3.1.1.1	Human skin (and that of other mammals) is packed with diverse mechanoreceptors that generate varied sensations (Figure 45.6).
7.45.3.1.1.2	The most important tactile receptors, found in both hairy and non-hairy skin, are Merkel&#x2019;s discs, which adapt rather slowly and provide continuous information about anything touching the skin.
7.45.3.1.1.3	Meissner&#x2019;s corpuscles, found primarily in non-hairy skin, are very sensitive but adapt rapidly; they provide information about changes in things touching the skin.
7.45.3.1.1.4	The rapid adaptation of Meissner&#x2019;s corpuscles is why you roll a small object between your fingers (rather than holding it still) to discern its shape and texture: as you roll it, the object continually stimulates Meissner&#x2019;s corpuscles.
7.45.3.1.1.5	Figure 45.6 The Skin Feels Many Sensations
7.45.3.1.2.1	Deeper in the skin, Ruffini endings adapt slowly and are good at providing information about vibrating stimuli of low frequencies, while Pacinian corpuscles, which adapt rapidly, provide information about vibrating stimuli of higher frequencies.
7.45.3.1.2.2	Even deeper in the skin, the dendrites of sensory neurons wrap around hair follicles.
7.45.3.1.2.3	When the surface hairs are displaced, those neurons are stimulated.
7.45.3.1.3.1	The density of tactile mechanoreceptor cells varies across the body&#x2019;s surface.
7.45.3.1.3.2	By touching the skin with two toothpicks simultaneously (when a person&#x2019;s eyes are closed!), you can determine how far apart two stimuli have to be before the person can tell whether the sensations are produced by one toothpick or by two.
7.45.3.1.3.3	On back skin, stimuli have to be relatively far apart before they are perceived as two discrete stimuli.
7.45.3.1.3.4	But when this same &#x201C;two-point spatial discrimination test&#x201D; is applied to the lips or fingertips, a person can identify two stimuli as separate even when they are quite close together, because the receptor density is much greater in these regions.
7.45.3.2.1.1	An animal receives information from mechanoreceptors about the position of its limbs and the stresses on its muscles and joints.
7.45.3.2.1.2	These mechanoreceptors supply information continuously to the CNS, and this information is essential for postural control and the coordination of movements.
7.45.3.2.2.1	The mechanoreceptors in skeletal muscle are the muscle spindles.
7.45.3.2.2.2	These stretch receptors are modified muscle cells embedded in connective tissue inside muscles and innervated by sensory neurons (Figure 45.7A).
7.45.3.2.2.3	When a muscle is stretched, the muscle spindles are stretched as well, signaling the spindle neurons to transmit action potentials to the CNS.
7.45.3.2.2.4	Figure 45.1 showed how crayfish stretch receptors transduce physical force into action potentials; the actions of muscle spindles are similar.
7.45.3.2.2.5	The CNS uses the information from muscle spindles to adjust the strength of the muscle contraction so that it matches the load put on the muscle; thus a person can hold a mug steady while it is being filled.
7.45.3.2.3.1	Figure 45.7 Stretch Receptors
7.45.3.2.4.1	Another type of mechanoreceptor, the Golgi tendon organ, is found in tendons and ligaments and provides information about the force generated by a contracting muscle (Figure 45.7B).
7.45.3.2.4.2	When a contraction becomes too forceful, action potentials from the Golgi tendon organ inhibit the spinal cord motor neurons innervating that muscle, causing the muscle to relax and protecting it from tearing.
7.45.3.2.4.3	(You may recall a cell organelle called the Golgi apparatus.
7.45.3.2.4.4	What these two very different structures have in common is their discovery in the late nineteenth century by the Italian anatomist Camillo Golgi. )
7.45.3.3.1.1	Hair cells are the mechanoreceptors for the vertebrate auditory (sound-perceiving) and vestibular (equilibrium-maintaining) systems.
7.45.3.3.1.2	Both of these systems are housed in the complex structures of the vertebrate ear.
7.45.3.3.1.3	Stereocilia&#x2014;fingerlike extensions of the cell membrane stiffened by cross-linked actin filaments&#x2014;project from the surface of each hair cell like a set of organ pipes (Figure 45.8).
7.45.3.3.1.4	Stereocilia bend in response to waves of pressure; bending of the stereocilia in one direction depolarizes the hair cell, and bending in the other direction hyperpolarizes it.
7.45.3.3.2.1	Figure 45.8 Hair Cells Have Mechanosensors on Their Stereocilia
7.45.3.3.3.1	Measurements with microelectrodes have shown that the bending of stereocilia creates local electric currents near their tips, indicating that ion channels near the tips must be opening or closing.
7.45.3.3.3.2	Electron microscope images reveal minute filaments that connect the tip of each stereocilium to its taller neighbor.
7.45.3.3.3.3	It is hypothesized that these filaments are fine molecular attachments to the ion channels, and that they act like springs that open the channels.
7.45.3.3.3.4	If the taller neighboring stereocilium is bent away, the spring tightens and the ion channel is opened.
7.45.3.3.3.5	If the taller neighbor bends toward its shorter neighbor, the spring is relaxed and the channel closes (see Figure 45.8).
7.45.3.4.1.1	The stimuli that animals perceive as sounds are pressure waves.
7.45.3.4.1.2	Auditory systems use mechanoreceptors to convert pressure waves into receptor potentials.
7.45.3.4.1.3	Auditory systems include special structures that gather sound waves, direct them to the sensory organ, and amplify their effect on the mechanoreceptors.
7.45.3.4.1.4	A good example of an auditory system is the human ear (Focus: Key Figure 45.9), which can be divided into three major areas: the outer, middle, and inner ear (see Figure 45.9A).
7.45.3.4.2.1	focus: key figure
7.45.3.4.3.1	Figure 45.9 Structures of the Human Ear
7.45.3.4.4.1	Q: How can the ears detect directionality of a sound source?
7.45.3.4.1.1.1	The outer ear consists of the pinnae (singular, pinna) and the auditory canal.
7.45.3.4.1.1.2	The pinnae collect sound waves and direct them into the auditory canals; watch a dog change the orientation of its ears to focus on a particular sound to get the idea of the role pinnae play in hearing.
7.45.3.4.1.1.3	Covering the end of the auditory canal is the tympanic membrane (commonly called the eardrum) which vibrates in response to pressure waves traveling down the canal, thus converting the pressure waves to physical forces in the middle ear.
7.45.3.4.2.1.1	On the other side of the tympanic membrane is the middle ear, an air-filled cavity connected to the throat at the back of the mouth through the eustachian tube (also called the pharyngotympanic tube).
7.45.3.4.2.1.2	Because the eustachian tube is also filled with air, pressure can equilibrate between the middle ear and the environment.
7.45.3.4.2.1.3	When you have a cold, the tube can be blocked by mucus or tissue swelling and you may have difficulty equilibrating the pressure in the middle ear with the outside air pressure (as you have to do when changing altitude in an airplane).
7.45.3.4.2.2.1	The middle ear contains the ossicles, three delicate bones individually named the malleus (&#x201C;hammer&#x201D;), incus (&#x201C;anvil&#x201D;), and stapes (&#x201C;stirrup&#x201D;) (see Figure 45.9B).
7.45.3.4.2.2.2	The ossicles transmit the vibrations of the tympanic membrane to another flexible membrane, the oval window.
7.45.3.4.2.2.3	The ossicles act as a lever (like a hammer pulling out a nail), translating a large movement of the tympanic membrane into a smaller movement of the oval window, but a movement of greater force.
7.45.3.4.2.2.4	Because the oval window is much smaller than the tympanic membrane, the pressure the stapes transmits to the oval window is more than 20 times greater than the pressure exerted by a sound wave on the tympanic membrane.
7.45.3.4.2.3.1	Behind the oval window lies the fluid-filled inner ear.
7.45.3.4.2.3.2	Movements of the oval window impart pressure changes to that enclosed fluid.
7.45.3.4.2.3.3	These pressure waves are transduced into action potentials.
7.45.3.4.3.1.1	The inner ear is a bony structure consisting of two sets of canals.
7.45.3.4.3.1.2	One is the organ of balance, the vestibular system, and the other is the organ of hearing, the cochlea.
7.45.3.4.3.1.3	The cochlea (&#x201C;snail&#x201D; or &#x201C;spiral shell&#x201D;) is a long, tapered, coiled structure.
7.45.3.4.3.1.4	A cross section of the cochlea reveals that it is composed of three parallel canals separated by two membranes, the vestibular membrane and the basilar membrane (see Figure 45.9C).
7.45.3.4.3.1.5	Sitting on the basilar membrane is the organ of Corti, which transduces pressure waves into action potentials.
7.45.3.4.3.1.6	The organ of Corti contains hair cells with stereocilia (see Figure 45.8).
7.45.3.4.3.1.7	The tips of the hair cells are embedded in a gelatinous overhanging shelf called the tectorial membrane (see Figure 45.9D).
7.45.3.4.3.2.1	Stereocilia are not motile, but because their tips are attached to the more rigid tectorial membrane, stereocilia bend when the basilar membrane flexes.
7.45.3.4.3.2.2	As shown in Figure 45.8, when the stereocilia are bent in one direction, the hair cell is depolarized by an inflow of K+ ions.
7.45.3.4.3.2.3	This effect of opening K+ channels happens because the fluid in the cochlear canal has a higher K+ concentration than does the intracellular fluid of the hair cell.
7.45.3.4.3.2.4	The response of the hair cell is a graded membrane potential.
7.45.3.4.3.2.5	The hair cells do not fire action potentials, but the changes in their membrane potential alter the rate at which the hair cells release neurotransmitter onto the sensory neurons whose axons make up the auditory nerve and transmit action potentials to the brain.
7.45.3.4.3.3.1	The vestibular and tympanic canals are separate until they reach the distal end of the cochlea (the end farthest from the oval window), where they join; thus they form one continuous canal that turns back on itself (see Figure 45.10).
7.45.3.4.3.3.2	Just as the oval window is a flexible membrane at the beginning of the vestibular canal, the round window is a flexible membrane at the end of the tympanic canal.
7.45.3.4.3.3.3	When the oval window vibrates, the waves of fluid pressure create traveling waves of flexion in the basilar membrane.
7.45.3.5.1.1	What causes the basilar membrane to flex, and how does this mechanism distinguish sounds of different frequencies?
7.45.3.5.1.2	Air is highly compressible but fluids are not; therefore a pressure wave can travel through air without displacing much air, whereas a pressure wave in fluid displaces that fluid.
7.45.3.5.1.3	When the stapes pushes on the oval window, the fluid in the vestibular canal is displaced.
7.45.3.5.1.4	If the movement of the oval window occurs slowly, the cochlear fluid pressure wave travels down the vestibular canal, around the bend, and back through the tympanic canal (Figure 45.10).
7.45.3.5.1.5	At the end of the tympanic canal, the displacement pressure is dissipated by the outward bulging of the round window.
7.45.3.5.2.1	Figure 45.10 Sensing Pressure Waves in the Inner Ear
7.45.3.5.3.1	The basilar membrane is not uniform&#x2014;it is thicker and stiffer at its base and wider and thinner at its apical end.
7.45.3.5.3.2	Pressure waves in the cochlear fluid have different frequencies and set up different patterns of traveling waves.
7.45.3.5.3.3	High-frequency waves cause maximal flexion at the basal end of the basilar membrane, whereas low-frequency pressure waves result in maximal flexion at the apical end (see Figure 45.10).
7.45.3.5.3.4	Thus different pitches of sound flex the basilar membrane at different locations and activate different sets of hair cells.
7.45.3.5.3.5	Action potentials stimulated by the mechanoreceptors at different positions along the organ of Corti travel along the cochlear nerve and are transmitted to different regions of the brain&#x2019;s auditory cortex by the vestibulocochlear nerve.
7.45.3.6.1.1	There are two general types of acquired hearing loss, or deafness.
7.45.3.6.1.2	Conduction deafness is caused by the loss of function of the tympanic membrane and/or the ossicles of the middle ear.
7.45.3.6.1.3	Repeated infections of the middle ear can cause scarring of the tympanic membrane and stiffening of the connections between the ossicles.
7.45.3.6.1.4	The consequence is less efficient conduction of sound waves from the tympanic membrane to the oval window.
7.45.3.6.1.5	With increasing age, the ossicles inevitably stiffen, resulting in a gradual loss of the ability to hear high-frequency sounds.
7.45.3.6.2.1	Nerve deafness is caused by damage to the inner ear or the auditory pathways.
7.45.3.6.2.2	A common cause of nerve deafness is damage to the hair cells of the delicate organ of Corti by exposure to loud sounds such as jet engines, pneumatic drills, or highly amplified music.
7.45.3.6.2.3	Consistent exposure to sounds above 85 decibels can damage hearing; this damage is cumulative and irreversible.
7.45.3.6.2.4	Even using earphones can put you at risk for hearing loss because they generate high-pressure sound waves close to the tympanic membrane.
7.45.3.6.2.5	Personal stereo earphones can reach 120 decibels, and people commonly use them at 100 decibels (equivalent to being at a rock concert).
7.45.3.7.1.1	Hair cells in the vestibular system of the inner ear detect the position and movement of the head&#x2014;information essential for maintaining equilibrium (balance).
7.45.3.7.1.2	Information from the vestibular system is also crucial for the control of eye movements.
7.45.3.7.1.3	When you look at something, you can move your head while staying focused on the object because of your vestibulo-ocular reflex.
7.45.3.7.2.1	In the mammalian inner ear, the vestibular system consists of three bony semicircular canals and a bony chamber called the vestibule.
7.45.3.7.2.2	Within each canal is a membranous semicircular duct, and within the vestibule are the membranous saccule and the utricle.
7.45.3.7.2.3	The ducts and the saccule and utricle are filled with fluid.
7.45.3.7.2.4	In the semicircular ducts, the fluid shifts when the head changes position (Figure 45.11A).
7.45.3.7.2.5	Since the three semicircular canals have different orientations, the fluid in their ducts responds differentially to the direction of movement.
7.45.3.7.2.6	Projecting into the base of each duct is a cupula, a gelatinous swelling enclosing a cluster of hair cell stereocilia.
7.45.3.7.2.7	When the shifting fluid pushes on the cupula, it bends the stereocilia and causes a graded potential in the hair cell membranes.
7.45.3.7.3.1	Figure 45.11 Organs of Equilibrium
7.45.3.7.4.1	The stereocilia in the saccule and utricle are bent in a different way.
7.45.3.7.4.2	These stereocilia are embedded in gelatinous membranes that contain otoliths (&#x201C;ear stones&#x201D;) which are crystals of calcium carbonate.
7.45.3.7.4.3	When the head changes position or when it accelerates or decelerates, gravitational forces are exerted on the otoliths and the stereocilia bend (Figure 45.11B).
7.45.3.7.5.1	As in the cochlea, the hair cells of the vestibular system do not fire action potentials, but they release neurotransmitter at synapses with sensory neurons, which in turn fire action potentials.
7.45.3.7.6.1	Motion sickness is a common malady experienced as seasickness or car sickness.
7.45.3.7.6.2	This condition occurs when the vestibulular system and the visual system produce conflicting information.
7.45.3.7.6.3	The vestibular system may be indicating movement when the visual system is not, or vice versa.
7.45.3.7.7.1	45.3 recap
7.45.3.7.8.1	Sensations that derive from mechanoreceptors include touch, tickle, pressure, joint position, muscle load, hearing, and equilibrium.
7.45.3.7.8.2	The membranes of mechanoreceptors have ion channels that are opened by distortion of the membrane, resulting in graded receptor potentials that cause the cell to release neurotransmitter or to fire action potentials.
7.45.3.7.8.3	Hair cells involved in hearing and equilibrium have stereocilia that are bent by pressure waves, resulting in receptor potentials.

7.45.3.7.19.1	45.4 Photoreceptors Respond to Light
7.45.4.1.1	Invertebrates have a variety of visual systems
7.45.4.2.1	Image-forming eyes evolved independently in vertebrates and cephalopods
7.45.4.3.1	The vertebrate retina receives and processes visual information
7.45.4.4.1	Opsins are the universal photoreceptor molecule in animals
7.45.4.5.1	Rod and cone cells are the photoreceptors of the vertebrate retina
7.45.4.6.1	Information flows through layers of neurons in the retina
7.45.4.7.1	Sensitivity to light&#x2014;photosensitivity&#x2014;confers on the simplest animals the ability to orient to the sun and sky, and it gives more complex animals rapid and extremely detailed information about objects in their environment.
7.45.4.7.2	Photosensitivity is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, and the molecular basis for that sensitivity is a family of visual pigments that have been evolutionarily conserved.
7.45.4.8.1	focus your learning
7.45.4.9.1	Rhodopsin transduces light energy into changes in membrane potential.
7.45.4.10.1	Vertebrate rods are sensitive to light with high sensitivity; cones are sensitive to color.
7.45.4.11.1	Receptive fields of photoreceptors send their output to ganglion cells along with lateral processing by horizontal and amacrine cells, enabling motion and contrast detection.
7.45.4.12.1	In this section you will learn about the structures of eyes, the organs that gather light energy and focus it onto photoreceptor cells.
7.45.4.12.2	Then you will learn how visual pigment molecules of photoreceptors respond when stimulated by light energy and the molecular mechanism that transforms that light energy into action potentials.
7.45.4.12.3	You will also learn about color vision and how photoreceptor information is processed in the neural layers of the vertebrate eye.
7.45.4.1.1.1	Photoreceptors and visual pigments are incorporated into a variety of visual systems, from simple to complex.
7.45.4.1.1.2	Flatworms obtain directional information about light from photoreceptor cells that are organized into eye cups.
7.45.4.1.1.3	The eye cups are paired, bilateral structures, each partly shielded from light by a layer of pigmented cells lining the cup.
7.45.4.1.2.1	The photoreceptors on the two sides of the animal are unequally stimulated unless the animal is facing directly toward or away from a light source.
7.45.4.1.2.2	The flatworm generally uses directional information from the eye cups to move away from light.
7.45.4.1.3.1	Arthropods have compound eyes that provide them with information about patterns in the environment.
7.45.4.1.3.2	These eyes are called compound because each eye consists of many optical units called ommatidia (singular ommatidium), each with its own narrow-angle lens (Figure 45.12).
7.45.4.1.3.3	In contrast, a vertebrate eye consists of just one optical unit with a wide-angle lens.
7.45.4.1.3.4	The number of ommatidia in a compound eye varies from only a few in some ants to 800 in fruit flies and to 30,000 in some dragonflies.
7.45.4.1.4.1	Figure 45.12 Ommatidia: The Functional Units of Insect Eyes
7.45.4.1.5.1	Each ommatidium has a lens that directs light onto photoreceptor cells.
7.45.4.1.5.2	Flies, for example, have eight elongated photoreceptors in each ommatidium.
7.45.4.1.5.3	The inner borders of the photoreceptors are covered with microvilli that contain a photosensitive pigment that traps light.
7.45.4.1.5.4	Axons from the photoreceptors send the light information to the nervous system.
7.45.4.1.5.5	Since each ommatidium of a compound eye is directed at a slightly different part of the visual world, only a low-resolution (pixillated) image can be communicated from the compound eye to the CNS.
7.45.4.2.1.1	Both vertebrates and cephalopod mollusks (such as squid and octopus) have eyes with exceptional abilities to form detailed images of the visual world.
7.45.4.2.1.2	Like cameras, both of these eye types focus inverted images on an internal surface that is sensitive to light.
7.45.4.2.1.3	Considering that they evolved completely independently of each other, their degree of similarity is remarkable (Figure 45.13).
7.45.4.2.2.1	Figure 45.13 Convergent Evolution of Eyes
7.45.4.2.3.1	The vertebrate eye (see Figure 45.13A) is a spherical, fluid-filled structure bounded by a tough connective tissue layer called the sclera.
7.45.4.2.3.2	The sclera at the front of the eye forms the transparent cornea, through which light passes to enter the eye.
7.45.4.2.3.3	Just inside the cornea is the pigmented iris, which gives the eye its color.
7.45.4.2.3.4	The iris controls the amount of light that reaches the photoreceptor cells at the back of the eye, just as the diaphragm of a camera controls the exposure.
7.45.4.2.3.5	The central opening of the iris is the pupil.
7.45.4.2.3.6	The iris is under neural control.
7.45.4.2.3.7	In bright light, the iris constricts and the pupil is very small.
7.45.4.2.3.8	As light levels fall, the iris opens and the pupil enlarges.
7.45.4.2.4.1	Behind the iris is the crystalline protein lens that makes fine adjustments in the focus of images falling on the photosensitive layer&#x2014;the retina&#x2014;at the back of the eye.
7.45.4.2.4.2	The cornea and the gel-like mass (vitreous humor) within the eye bend light rays passing through them so that they are focused on the retina.
7.45.4.2.4.3	The lens makes fine adjustments to the focus and allows the eye to accommodate&#x2014;that is, to focus on objects at various locations in the near visual field.
7.45.4.2.4.4	To focus a camera on objects close at hand, you adjust the distance between the lens and the internal surface sensitive to light.
7.45.4.2.4.5	Fish, amphibians, and non-avian reptiles accommodate in a similar manner, moving the lenses of their eyes closer to or farther from their retinas.
7.45.4.2.4.6	Mammals and birds use a different method; they alter the shape of the lens.
7.45.4.2.4.7	Figure 45.14 Staying in Focus
7.45.4.2.5.1	The mammalian lens is contained in a connective tissue sheath that tends to keep it in a spherical shape, but the sheath is attached to suspensory ligaments that pull the lens into a flatter shape.
7.45.4.2.5.2	Circular ciliary muscles counteract the pull of the suspensory ligaments, permitting the lens to round up.
7.45.4.2.5.3	When the ciliary muscles are at rest, the flatter lens has the correct optical properties to focus distant images on the retina.
7.45.4.2.5.4	Contracting the ciliary muscles rounds up the lens, changing its light-bending properties to bring close images into focus (Figure 45.14).
7.45.4.3.1.1	During embryonic development, neural tissue grows out from the brain to form the retina.
7.45.4.3.1.2	In addition to a layer of photoreceptor cells, the retina includes other cells arranged in layers that process visual information from the photoreceptors (see Figure 45.20).
7.45.4.3.1.3	Light must pass through all the layers of retinal cells before being captured by photosensors.
7.45.4.3.1.4	In humans and other day-active animals, the light that is not captured is absorbed by a black-pigmented epithelial tissue layer behind the retina.
7.45.4.3.1.5	In contrast, nocturnal animals such as deer and raccoons have an iridescent reflective layer behind their retinas, which maximizes the capture of photons by reflecting them back onto the photoreceptors.
7.45.4.3.1.6	This is why a deer in the headlights or your pet dog or cat in a flash photo appears to have bright white eyes.
7.45.4.3.1.7	In contrast, humans do not have a white reflective layer in the retina, so flash photographs often have a &#x201C;red-eye effect,&#x201D; caused by the flash being reflected by the abundant blood vessels in the retina.
7.45.4.4.1.1	Photosensitivity in animals depends on the ability of opsin molecules to absorb photons of light and activate a G protein.
7.45.4.4.1.2	Opsins are proteins that are not themselves photosensitive, but they contain covalently bound functional groups called 11-cis-retinal (Figure 45.15).
7.45.4.4.1.3	Retinal absorbs photons of light, and the color of light it is receives depends on the structure of its opsin.
7.45.4.4.1.4	There are several different opsins, and the most common one that gives humans sensitivity to low levels of light, but not color, is called rhodopsin.
7.45.4.4.2.1	Figure 45.15 Light Changes the Conformation of Rhodopsin
7.45.4.4.3.1	When 11-cis-retinal absorbs a photon of light energy, it changes into a different isomer of retinal, called all-trans-retinal.
7.45.4.4.3.2	This change puts a strain on the bonds between retinal and opsin, changing the conformation of opsin and signaling the detection of light.
7.45.4.4.3.3	In vertebrate eyes, the retinal and the opsin eventually separate from each other (a process called bleaching), which causes the opsin to lose its photosensitivity.
7.45.4.4.3.4	A series of enzymatic reactions returns the all-trans-retinal to the 11-cis isomer, which then recombines with opsin so that it once again becomes photosensitive.
7.45.4.4.4.1	How does the conformational change of opsin transduce light into a cellular response?
7.45.4.4.4.2	After retinal is converted from the 11-cis to the all-trans form, its interactions with opsin pass through several unstable intermediate stages.
7.45.4.4.4.3	One of these stages triggers a cascade of reactions involving a G protein signaling mechanism that results in the alteration of membrane potential that is the photoreceptor cell&#x2019;s response to light.
7.45.4.5.1.1	Figure 45.16 Rods and Cones
7.45.4.5.2.1	The photoreceptors of the vertebrate retina are two types of modified neurons called rod cells and cone cells based on their shapes (Figure 45.16).
7.45.4.5.2.2	Rod cells are highly light-sensitive and perceive shades of gray in dim light.
7.45.4.5.2.3	Cone cells function at high light levels and are responsible for high-acuity color vision.
7.45.4.5.2.4	The human retina has about 5 million cones and 100 million rods, but the density of each varies across the retina.
7.45.4.5.1.1.1	Rod cells do not produce action potentials, but they release neurotransmitter from their bases, where they form synapses with the next neurons in the visual pathway.
7.45.4.5.1.1.2	Each rod cell has an outer segment, an inner segment, and a synaptic terminal (see Figure 45.16).
7.45.4.5.1.1.3	The highly specialized outer segment contains stacks of discs made up of cell membranes densely packed with rhodopsin.
7.45.4.5.1.1.4	These discs capture photons of light.
7.45.4.5.1.1.5	The inner segment contains the cell nucleus, mitochondria, and other organelles.
7.45.4.5.1.1.6	The synaptic terminal is where the rod cell communicates with other neurons.
7.45.4.5.1.2.1	To see how a rod cell responds to light, we can penetrate a single rod cell with an electrode and record its membrane potential in the dark and in the light, as shown in Figure 45.17.
7.45.4.5.1.2.2	From what you have learned about other types of sensory receptors, you might expect that stimulation of the rod cell by light would make its membrane potential less negative, but the opposite is true&#x2014;it becomes more negative, that is, it becomes hyperpolarized.
7.45.4.5.1.3.1	Rod cell outer segments have cGMP gated sodium channels.
7.45.4.5.1.3.2	In the dark, abundant cGMP in the cell keeps these channels open, creating the dark current.
7.45.4.5.1.3.3	When light is flashed on the dark-adapted rod cell, these Na+ channels close in proportion to the intensity of the light, and the cell&#x2019;s membrane potential becomes more negative&#x2014;it hyperpolarizes (see Figure 45.17).
7.45.4.5.1.3.4	The rate of neurotransmitter release from the base of the cell changes as membrane potential changes.
7.45.4.5.1.3.5	As the rod cell hyperpolarizes, its release of neurotransmitter decreases.

7.45.4.5.1.7.2	Rod cells do not fire action potentials, but in response to the absorption of light energy, the neuron undergoes a change in membrane potential.
7.45.4.5.1.8.1	HYPOTHESIS  When a rod cell absorbs photons (light energy), its membrane potential changes in proportion to the strength of the light stimulus.
7.45.4.5.1.9.1	METHOD
7.45.4.5.1.10.1	Record membrane potentials from the inner segment of a rod cell.
7.45.4.5.1.11.1	Stimulate the rod cells with light flashes of varying intensity and record the results.
7.45.4.5.1.12.1	CONCLUSION  The membrane potential of rod cells is depolarized in the dark and hyperpolarizes (becomes more negative) in response to light.
7.45.4.5.1.13.1	How does the absorption of light by rhodopsin hyperpolarize the rod cell?
7.45.4.5.1.13.2	As illustrated in Figure 45.15, when rhodopsin is excited by light it undergoes conformational changes that initiate a signaling cascade.
7.45.4.5.1.13.3	The dark-adapted rod cell has open Na+ channels&#x2014;the depolarizing dark current (Figure 45.18).
7.45.4.5.1.13.4	Light photons excite rhodopsin, which activates a G protein called transducin.
7.45.4.5.1.13.5	Activated transducin activates a phosphodiesterase (PDE).
7.45.4.5.1.13.6	Activated PDE converts cyclic GMP (cGMP) to GMP, which causes the cGMP gated Na+ channels to close, changing the balance between the inward flow of Na+ and the outward flow of K+ and causing the cell to hyperpolarize.
7.45.4.5.1.14.1	Figure 45.18 Light Absorption Closes Sodium Channels
7.45.4.5.1.15.1	This cascade may seem like a roundabout way of doing business, but its advantage is its enormous amplification ability.
7.45.4.5.1.15.2	Each molecule of light-excited rhodopsin can activate several hundred transducin molecules, thus activating a large number of PDE molecules.
7.45.4.5.1.15.3	The catalytic capacity of PDE is great&#x2014;one PDE molecule can hydrolyze several hundred molecules of cGMP per second.
7.45.4.5.1.15.4	The bottom line is that a single photon of light can result in the closure of a huge number of Na+ channels.
7.45.4.5.2.1.1	Cone cells are responsible for the high-acuity color vision of day-active vertebrates such as humans.
7.45.4.5.2.1.2	It is therefore logical that the highest density of cone cells is in the area of the retina that receives light from the center of the visual field, a region called the fovea (see Figure 45.13A).
7.45.4.5.2.1.3	The human fovea has about 160,000 cones per square millimeter.
7.45.4.5.2.1.4	But humans are not the champions of high-acuity vision; a hawk&#x2019;s fovea has almost twice that number of cones, making the hawk&#x2019;s vision much sharper than ours.
7.45.4.5.2.1.5	Birds also have two foveae in each eye; one receives light from straight ahead, the other from a more lateral field of vision.
7.45.4.5.2.1.6	The forward-looking foveae make binocular vision possible, while the lateral-looking foveae provide high-acuity vision.
7.45.4.5.2.1.7	Birds use both sets of foveae by frequently turning their heads slightly; they cannot move their eyes in the sockets as humans can.
7.45.4.5.2.2.1	Cones have low sensitivity to light and contribute little to night vision.
7.45.4.5.2.2.2	Night vision depends mostly on rod cells, which is why vision in dim light is mostly in shades of gray and acuity is low.
7.45.4.5.2.2.3	You may have trouble seeing a small object at night when you are looking straight at it&#x2014;that is, when its image is falling on your fovea.
7.45.4.5.2.2.4	If you look a little to the side, so that the image falls on a rod-rich area of your retina, you see the object better.
7.45.4.5.2.2.5	Astronomers looking for faint objects in the sky learned this trick a long time ago.
7.45.4.5.2.2.6	The retinas of nocturnal animals, such as flying squirrels, contain a high percentage of rods.
7.45.4.5.2.2.7	By contrast, some animals that are active only during the day (such as chipmunks) have mostly cones in their retinas.
7.45.4.5.2.2.8	Figure 45.19 Absorption Spectra of Cone Cells
7.45.4.5.2.3.1	The human retina has three kinds of cone cells, each containing slightly different opsin molecules that differ in the wavelengths of light they absorb best.
7.45.4.5.2.3.2	Although the same 11-cis-retinal group is the light-absorber in all three kinds of cones, its molecular interactions with opsin determine the spectral sensitivity of the cone cell as a whole (Figure 45.19).
7.45.4.5.2.3.3	Those that absorb maximally around 419 nanometers (nm) are called S-cones for short wavelength (blue range).
7.45.4.5.2.3.4	Those that absorb maximally around 531 nm are called M-cones for medium wavelength (green range), and those that absorb maximally around 559 nm are called L-cones for long wavelength (yellow-red range).
7.45.4.5.2.3.5	Because different wavelengths of light are differentially absorbed by the different cone cell visual pigments, the brain interprets the relative inputs from the different classes as a full range of color.
7.45.4.5.2.3.6	Color blindness in humans results from the absence or dysfunction of one or more of the three classes of cone cells.
7.45.4.5.2.3.7	Some mammals have only one or two classes of cone cells, whereas birds have four.
7.45.4.6.1.1	The human retina is organized into layers of neurons that receive visual information and process it before sending it to the brain (Figure 45.20).
7.45.4.6.1.2	Closest to the lens (and thus to light input) is a layer of ganglion cells; a central layer contains three neuronal types, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and amacrine cells; and at the &#x201C;rear&#x201D; of the retina lie the photoreceptors (rods and cones).
7.45.4.6.1.3	The layers of cells between the photoreceptors and the ganglion cells process information about the visual field.
7.45.4.6.2.1	Figure 45.20 The Human Retina
7.45.4.6.1.1.1	From our discussion of rod cells, you know that the photoreceptor cells at the back of the retina hyperpolarize in response to light and do not generate action potentials.
7.45.4.6.1.1.2	The ganglion cells at the front of the retina do, however, fire action potentials.
7.45.4.6.1.1.3	The axons of ganglion cells form the optic nerves that travel to the brain.
7.45.4.6.1.2.1	The ganglion cells are connected to the photoreceptors by bipolar cells.
7.45.4.6.1.2.2	Changes in the membrane potential of rods and cones in response to light alter the rates at which the rods and cones release neurotransmitter at their synapses with the bipolar cells.
7.45.4.6.1.2.3	In response to this neurotransmitter, the membrane potentials of the bipolar cells change, altering the rate at which they release neurotransmitter onto ganglion cells.
7.45.4.6.1.2.4	The neurotransmitter release from the bipolar cells determines the rate at which ganglion cells fire action potentials.
7.45.4.6.1.2.5	Thus the direct flow of information in the retina is from photoreceptor to bipolar cell to ganglion cell.
7.45.4.6.1.2.6	The ganglion cells send the information to the brain via the optic nerves.
7.45.4.6.1.3.1	Each human eye contains about 1.2 million ganglion cells but more than 100 million rods and cones.
7.45.4.6.1.3.2	Therefore there must be convergence of information as it passes from the photoreceptors to the ganglion cells.
7.45.4.6.1.3.3	A given bipolar cell can receive input from multiple rods or multiple cones, but not from both.
7.45.4.6.1.3.4	The relationship between photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells depends on their location on the retina.
7.45.4.6.1.3.5	In the fovea, a ganglion cell may receive input from as few as five photoreceptors, but in the periphery of the retina, a ganglion cell may receive input from thousands of photoreceptors.
7.45.4.6.1.3.6	Visual acuity is a reflection of these quantitative relationships.
7.45.4.6.1.4.1	The patch of photoreceptors that communicates with a ganglion cell forms a circular receptive field.
7.45.4.6.1.4.2	When light falls on a receptive field, its ganglion cell can be either excited or inhibited.
7.45.4.6.1.4.3	As mentioned above, each ganglion cell sends an axon to the brain in the optic nerves.
7.45.4.6.1.4.4	Thus the information coming from the retina to the brain is about the pattern of patches of light and dark falling on the retina.
7.45.4.6.1.4.5	We&#x2019;ll return to a discussion of how the brain constructs the visual field from the input from receptive fields in Chapter 46.
7.45.4.6.2.1.1	The other two cell layers, the horizontal cells and the amacrine cells, consist of interneurons that communicate laterally across the retina.
7.45.4.6.2.1.2	Horizontal cells form synapses with neighboring photoreceptors and bipolar cells.
7.45.4.6.2.1.3	Thus light falling on one photoreceptor can influence the sensitivity of its neighbors to light.
7.45.4.6.2.1.4	This lateral flow of information enables the retina to sharpen the perception of contrast between light and dark patterns.
7.45.4.6.2.1.5	Amacrine cells form local interconnections between bipolar cells and ganglion cells.
7.45.4.6.2.1.6	Some amacrine cells are highly sensitive to changing illumination or to motion.
7.45.4.6.2.1.7	Others assist in adjusting the sensitivity of the eyes according to the overall level of light falling on the retina.
7.45.4.6.2.1.8	When background light levels change, amacrine cell connections to the ganglion cells adjust the range of intensities to which they are sensitive.
7.45.4.6.2.1.9	Thus even with large changes in background illumination such as going from outdoors into a building, the eyes are still sensitive to small, rapid changes in the pattern of light falling on the retina.
7.45.4.6.2.1.10	The light reflected from this page can vary by nine orders of magnitude (1,000,000,000-fold) between a sunny outdoor environment and a moonless night.
7.45.4.6.2.1.11	Even though our eyes function best over a light-intensity range of only two orders of magnitude, modulation by amacrine cells can rapidly shift that functional range to accommodate a wide range of light intensities.
7.45.4.6.2.2.1	45.4 recap
7.45.4.6.2.3.1	Vertebrates have image-forming eyes in which a lens focuses incoming light onto the photosensitive retina.
7.45.4.6.2.3.2	Opsin molecules are responsible for light sensitivity in all animals, and in mammals opsins are contained in receptor cells called rods and cones.
7.45.4.6.2.3.3	Slight differences in the opsin molecules result in differences in spectral sensitivity, which is the basis for color vision.
7.45.4.6.2.3.4	Rods and cones do not fire action potentials, but their graded membrane potentials alter neurotransmitter release onto retinal bipolar cells.
7.45.4.6.2.3.5	The bipolar cells in turn influence ganglion cells that do fire action potentials in their axons, which travel in the optic nerves to the brain.
7.45.4.6.2.3.6	Two other types of retinal cells, horizontal and amacrine cells, sharpen contrast and adjust sensitivity of the retina, respectively.

7.45.4.6.2.15.3	In Chapter 46 you will learn how the mammalian brain reassembles sensory information into our perception of the world.

7.45.4.6.2.17.1	How do pit vipers &#x201C;see&#x201D; in the dark?
7.45.4.6.2.18.1	The pit organs of rattlesnakes are the infrared detectors that signal the presence of warm-blooded prey.
7.45.4.6.2.18.2	In this chapter we considered how the pit organs transduce infrared radiation into neural information.
7.45.4.6.2.18.3	Infrared is a portion of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum, as is visible light.
7.45.4.6.2.18.4	So could the receptor cells in the pit organs be modified photoreceptors?
7.45.4.6.2.18.5	Or have they evolved from the types of sensory neurons in the skin that sense temperature?
7.45.4.6.2.18.6	The temperature-sensitive neuron theory seems more likely since there is no rhodopsin in the pit organs.
7.45.4.6.2.18.7	But how did such neurons acquire an acute sensitivity to minute changes in temperature of the pit organ caused by distant infrared emitters?
7.45.4.6.2.18.8	The experiments covered in Investigating Life: How Do Pit Vipers &#x201C;See&#x201D; in the Dark? identified a particular TRP channel that is highly expressed in the trigeminal ganglia but not in the dorsal root ganglia of rattlesnakes.
7.45.4.6.2.18.9	These experiments also revealed that the TRPA1 channel is not highly expressed in the TG or DRGs of non-pit snakes, but is highly expressed in a distantly related pit snake, the python.
7.45.4.6.2.18.10	In the online exercise to Investigating Life: How Do Pit Vipers &#x201C;See&#x201D; in the Dark? it was determined that expression of the TRPA1 gene in frog oocytes causes them to have a steep temperature sensitivity in the range of 36&#x00B0;C to 42&#x00B0;C.
7.45.4.6.2.18.11	Thus we can conclude that the TRPA1 channel has evolved along with the pit organ to enable pit vipers such as the rattlesnake to detect warm-blooded prey.
7.45.4.6.2.19.1	Future directions
7.45.4.6.2.20.1	The identification of specific genes that convey specific sensory capabilities&#x2014;for example, identification of the different opsin genes for color vision and the TRPA1 gene for infrared detection&#x2014;raise the possibility that genetic engineering efforts could be directed toward expanding the sensory capabilities of animals, and even humans.
7.45.4.6.2.20.2	What would it be like to be able to see in the infrared and the ultraviolet ranges or to hear infrasound and ultrasound?
7.45.4.6.2.20.3	Would the human brain be able to process and integrate that huge amount of additional information?
7.45.4.6.2.20.4	How would our conscious perception of reality be changed?

7.45.summary.34.1	Bats prey on nocturnal moths using echolocation.
7.45.summary.34.2	A bat pursuing prey emits ultrasonic signals that reflect off flying moths and echo back to the bat, enabling it to home in on the prey.
7.45.summary.34.3	Moths can &#x201C;hear&#x201D; ultrasonic bat signals through paired auditory organs (tympana) that respond to both low- and high-intensity sound waves.
7.45.summary.34.4	The moths have evolved evasive behaviors to evade capture.
7.45.summary.35.1	Some moths use rapid changes in flight behavior, such as turning away or rapid dives, to evade capture.
7.45.summary.35.2	Others use unique tymbal organs, located in the thorax, to produce ultrasonic clicks.
7.45.summary.35.3	Researchers hypothesized that these clicks serve as echolocation-jamming mechanisms.
7.45.summary.35.4	To test this hypothesis they used tiger moths (Bertholdia trigona).
7.45.summary.35.5	One group of moths (N = 41) had their tymbal organs punctured, making them incapable of producing sounds (silenced), and another group (N = 38) were left with intact tymbal organs (clicking).
7.45.summary.35.6	Both groups were released into bat feeding areas.
7.45.summary.35.7	The fates of the released moths were documented with video and audio recordings.

7.46.8.1	Compare Google maps of London and New York City at the same scale.
7.46.8.2	In which city do you think it is easier to drive a taxi?
7.46.8.3	Eleanor Maguire at University College London was so impressed with the navigational abilities of London taxi drivers that she investigated whether there was anything &#8220;special&#8221; about their brains.
7.46.8.4	Using magnetic resonance imaging, Maguire and her colleagues examined the brains of taxi drivers with varying numbers of years of experience and compared them with each other and with the brains of control subjects who were not taxi drivers.
7.46.8.5	The studies revealed significant differences in the sizes of a brain region called the hippocampus.
7.46.9.1	The hippocampus is involved in learning and memory.
7.46.9.2	The posterior hippocampus in particular is implicated in the memory of spatial relationships among objects in the environment.
7.46.9.3	Maguire found that the posterior hippocampi of taxi drivers were larger than those of control subjects and that, among the cab drivers themselves, there was a positive correlation between the size of the posterior hippocampus and years of driving experience.
7.46.10.1	In Matt Wilson&#8217;s lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, researchers record the activity of hippocampal neurons of rats running in a maze.
7.46.10.2	Specific neurons called &#8220;place cells&#8221; fire action potentials only when the rat is at a particular location in the maze.
7.46.10.3	Thus when the rat runs the maze from beginning to end, a sequence of cell firing is recorded.
7.46.10.4	Sometimes when the rat is resting, the same sequence is recorded but is speeded up about 20 times, or the reverse sequence is recorded.
7.46.10.5	It seems as if the recordings are reflecting what the resting rat is thinking   where it has been, where it is going to go.
7.46.10.6	In a maze with a choice point (go right or go left), the sequence recorded when the rat is resting at the start position frequently predicts which direction it will turn.
7.46.11.1	The hippocampus is important for acquiring memories and consolidating them into long-term memory.
7.46.11.2	We also know that sleep is important for learning.
7.46.11.3	Could something be happening in the hippocampus during sleep to promote memory?
7.46.12.1	Can recordings of place cells reveal processes of memory consolidation during sleep?

7.46.1.7.1	The size of the human brain is off the curve
7.46.1.8.1	The organization of the mammalian nervous system can be described anatomically and functionally.
7.46.1.8.2	In anatomical terms, all vertebrate nervous systems consist of three parts: a brain, a spinal cord, and a set of peripheral nerves that reach all parts of the body.
7.46.1.8.3	As discussed in Key Concept 44.4, the brain and spinal cord are the central nervous system, or CNS, and the neurons that connect the CNS to all the tissues and sensors of the body are the peripheral nervous system, or PNS.
7.46.1.8.4	An additional division of the nervous system exists in the gut; we will discuss this enteric nervous system in Chapter 50.
7.46.1.9.1	focus your learning
7.46.1.10.1	Conscious sensory and unconscious physiological information flows to the central nervous system via afferent neurons, resulting in efferent outputs to voluntary muscles (i. e. , movement) and in involuntary commands over autonomic responses.
7.46.1.11.1	From anterior to posterior, the embryonic neural tube gives rise to the cerebrum, thalamus/hypothalamus, midbrain structures, and cerebellum/pons/medulla, respectively.
7.46.1.12.1	Specific areas within the five lobes of the cerebral cortex have sensory, motor, and associative functions.
7.46.1.13.1	Humans are called the &#8220;big-brain primates,&#8221; but factors other than size contribute to brain function in humans.
7.46.1.14.1	Recall from Key Concept 45.1 that a neuron is an electrically excitable cell that communicates via an axon.
7.46.1.14.2	When used in the context of a nervous system, the term nerve refers to a bundle of axons in the PNS that carry information about many things simultaneously.
7.46.1.14.3	Some axons in a nerve may be carrying information to the CNS while other axons in the same nerve are carrying information from the CNS to the body&#8217;s organs.
7.46.1.14.4	A discussion of the functional organization of the nervous system refers to these paths of information flow.
7.46.1.14.5	In this chapter we will divide the anatomy of the mammalian brain, spinal cord, and PNS into smaller, discrete functional units.
7.46.1.1.1.1	Figure 46.1 Organization of the Nervous System
7.46.1.1.2.1	Figure 46.1 illustrates the major avenues of information flow through the human nervous system.
7.46.1.1.2.2	The white boxes explain the four divisions of the PNS; two of these bring information from the periphery to the CNS, and two transmit information from the CNS to the periphery.
7.46.1.1.3.1	The afferent portion of the PNS (Figure 46.1, left) carries information from sensory receptor cells to the CNS.
7.46.1.1.3.2	We are conscious of much of this information (e. g. , light, sound, skin temperature, limb position), but we are usually unconscious of the information involved in physiological regulation (e. g. , blood pressure, deep body temperature, blood oxygen levels).
7.46.1.1.4.1	The efferent portion of the PNS (Figure 46.1, right) carries information from the CNS to the muscles and glands of the body.
7.46.1.1.4.2	Efferent pathways are divided into a voluntary division that executes our conscious movements; and an involuntary, or autonomic, division that controls physiological functions.
7.46.1.1.5.1	In addition to the neural information it receives from the PNS, the CNS receives chemical information from hormones circulating in the blood.
7.46.1.1.5.2	In turn, neurohormones released by neurons enter the circulation and affect neurons and other cells distant from the site of release (see Key Concept 40.1).
7.46.1.2.1.1	Early in the development of a vertebrate embryo, a tube of neural tissue forms (see Key Concept 43.4).
7.46.1.2.1.2	At its anterior end, this neural tube forms three swellings that become the hindbrain, midbrain, and forebrain.
7.46.1.2.1.3	The rest of the neural tube becomes the spinal cord.
7.46.1.2.1.4	Peripheral nerves sprout from the midbrain and hindbrain (the cranial nerves) and from the spinal cord (the spinal nerves).
7.46.1.2.1.5	From these early stages we see the linear axis of information flow in the nervous system.
7.46.1.2.1.6	Although the developing brain will fold and become a complex structure, the information flow in the adult nervous system will follow paths that emerge from the simple, linear neural tube.
7.46.1.2.2.1	Each of these three regions of the embryonic brain develops into several structures in the adult brain (Figure 46.2).
7.46.1.2.2.2	From the embryonic midbrain come structures that integrate information from the different senses and coordinate motor responses.
7.46.1.2.2.3	From the hindbrain come the medulla, the pons, and the cerebellum.
7.46.1.2.2.4	The medulla is continuous with the spinal cord, the pons is anterior to the medulla, and the cerebellum is a dorsal outgrowth of the pons.
7.46.1.2.2.5	The medulla and pons contain distinct groups of neurons involved in controlling physiological functions such as breathing, circulation, and basic motor patterns such as swallowing and vomiting.
7.46.1.2.2.6	All information traveling between the spinal cord and higher brain areas must pass through the pons, the medulla, and the midbrain, which are collectively known as the brainstem.
7.46.1.2.2.7	Figure 46.2 Development of the Central Nervous System
7.46.1.2.3.1	One function of the cerebellum is coordinating muscle activity and maintaining balance.
7.46.1.2.3.2	It is like the director of a movie; the cerebellum receives a &#8220;script&#8221; of the commands going to the muscles from higher brain areas, and it receives information about the actual performance coming up the spinal cord from the &#8220;actors&#8221;   the joints and muscles.
7.46.1.2.3.3	The cerebellum compares the &#8220;script&#8221; with the performance and refines motor commands accordingly.
7.46.1.2.3.4	Damage to the cerebellum results in loss of fine motor control and coordination.
7.46.1.2.4.1	The embryonic forebrain develops a central region called the diencephalon and a surrounding structure called the telencephalon.
7.46.1.2.4.2	The diencephalon is the core of the forebrain and consists of an upper structure, the thalamus, and a lower structure, the hypothalamus.
7.46.1.2.4.3	The thalamus is the final relay station for sensory information going to the telencephalon.
7.46.1.2.4.4	The hypothalamus receives a lot of physiological information of which we are not conscious, and it uses that information to regulate many physiological functions and biological drives.
7.46.1.2.4.5	A major function of the hypothalamus is to control the pituitary gland (see Key Concept 40.2).
7.46.1.2.5.1	The embryonic telencephalon gives rise to the cerebrum, consisting of the left and right cerebral hemispheres.
7.46.1.2.5.2	The outer layer of the cerebrum is the cerebral cortex, a thin layer rich in cell bodies.
7.46.1.2.5.3	If we compare vertebrate groups from fish through amphibians, reptiles, and mammals, the cerebrum increases in size, complexity, and importance   an evolutionary trend called telencephalization (see Figure 44.15).
7.46.1.2.5.4	In humans, the cerebrum is by far the largest part of the brain and plays major roles in sensory perception, learning, memory, and conscious behavior.
7.46.1.3.1.1	The spinal cord conveys information to and from the brain.
7.46.1.3.1.2	However, the spinal cord is more than an information pipe.
7.46.1.3.1.3	As you saw in Key Concept 44.4, the spinal cord carries out integrative functions as well.
7.46.1.3.1.4	The knee-jerk reflex (see Figure 44.14) is an example of a circuit between the PNS and the spinal cord that controls a simple behavioral function.
7.46.1.3.1.5	That simple circuit can be built on to control more complex behaviors such as the withdrawal reflex, which involves readjusting tension in many muscles on both sides of the body to coordinate movement and maintain balance.
7.46.1.4.1.1	Swallowing, salivating, breathing, eye movements, blood pressure regulation, and gut activity are only a few of the many autonomic functions that are localized in the medulla, the pons, and the midbrain.
7.46.1.4.1.2	To carry out these functions, the brainstem has its own components of the PNS, the 12 paired cranial nerves.
7.46.1.4.1.3	You encountered the olfactory nerve, the optic nerve, and the auditory nerve (cranial nerves I, II, and VIII) in Chapter 45.
7.46.1.4.1.4	Another one, cranial nerve X, is called the vagus (&#8220;wandering&#8221;) nerve because it travels into the body cavity and communicates with many of the organs, including the heart and the gut.
7.46.1.4.1.5	You will encounter the vagus nerve in subsequent chapters.
7.46.1.4.2.1	Anatomically distinct groups of neurons in the CNS that work together as a unit are called a nucleus (not to be confused with the nucleus of a single cell).
7.46.1.4.2.2	Axons from the neurons of many brainstem nuclei extend to various regions of the brain and modulate brain activity; for example, brainstem nuclei are involved in keeping the higher brain areas awake or allowing them to sleep.
7.46.1.4.2.3	All of the sensory information coming up the neural axis from the spinal cord passes through the brainstem on its way to the forebrain, and many of these ascending neuronal tracts give off branches to the awake-promoting nuclei in the brainstem.
7.46.1.4.2.4	Because the neuronal circuitry in this part of the brain is so complicated and because activity in these ascending sensory pathways can promote wakefulness, the core of the brainstem has been termed the reticular-activating system (&#8220;reticular&#8221; means netlike).
7.46.1.4.2.5	Damage to the brain or spinal cord below the reticular-activating system can result in paralysis but leave sleep   wake cycle behavior normal.
7.46.1.4.2.6	Damage above the level of the reticular-activating system can interrupt ascending wake-promoting activity resulting in a coma.
7.46.1.5.1.1	As mentioned above, the diencephalon consists of the thalamus and the hypothalamus.
7.46.1.5.1.2	The thalamus communicates sensory information to the cerebral cortex; the hypothalamus receives information about physiological conditions in the body and regulates many homeostatic functions.
7.46.1.5.1.3	Key Concept 39.5 describes how the hypothalamus is involved in regulating body temperature, and Key Concept 40.3 discusses the intimate association between the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland in the control of many homeostatic functions.
7.46.1.5.2.1	The forebrain of all vertebrates includes a phylogenetically old, complex set of structures called the limbic system (Figure 46.3).
7.46.1.5.2.2	The limbic system is responsible for some basic instincts and drives such as hunger and thirst, sexual behavior, and emotions.
7.46.1.5.2.3	Within the limbic system there are areas that, when stimulated with small electric currents, can cause intense sensations of pleasure, pain, or rage.
7.46.1.5.2.4	Figure 46.3 The Limbic System
7.46.1.5.3.1	Pleasure and pain centers in the limbic system are believed to play roles in learning and in physiological drives.
7.46.1.5.3.2	One component of the limbic system   the amygdala   is involved in fear and fear memory.
7.46.1.5.3.3	If a certain portion of the amygdala is damaged or chemically blocked, an animal that becomes tame and cannot learn to be afraid of a situation that would normally induce a strong fear reaction.
7.46.1.5.3.4	The amygdala is involved in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
7.46.1.5.3.5	Another part of the limbic system, the hippocampus, is involved in the transfer of certain types of short-term memory to long-term memory, as discussed in the chapter opener and in Investigating Life: Place Cells Reveal Processes of Memory Consolidation during Sleep.

7.46.1.5.9.1	HYPOTHESIS Memory of the maze-running experience is represented by a sequence of firing of hippocampal place cells.

7.46.1.5.14.1	RESULTS
7.46.1.5.15.1	CONCLUSIONS
7.46.1.5.16.1	Sequences of hippocampal-cell firing that correspond to locations in the maze were highly repeatable and probably represent the coding of that place information in the hippocampus.
7.46.1.5.17.1	During sleep, bursts of cell firing sometimes occurred that correspond wholly or partially to the sequences recorded when the rat was running in the maze.
7.46.1.5.18.1	work with the data
7.46.1.5.19.1	To conclude that a particular sequence of cell firing observed during sleep is a significant event   meaning that it could be a replay of the waking experience   we have to compare it with the probability that it would occur by random chance.
7.46.1.5.19.2	And we need to consider whether an observed sequence that includes some but not all of the components of the baseline &#8220;word&#8221; is nevertheless a significant event.
7.46.1.5.20.1	What is the minimum number of elements that would have to match the baseline sequence for it to be considered a significant event with P &lt; 0.01?
7.46.1.5.20.2	To find out, we need to calculate the probabilities of the recorded neurons firing randomly and creating the sequence matches.
7.46.1.5.20.3	First, let&#8217;s consider the probability of a recurrence by chance of the exact nine-&#8220;letter&#8221; baseline sequence being recorded in a single burst of that group of nine cells.
7.46.1.5.20.4	The total number of possible combinations of those nine letters can be calculated as the factorial 9!:
7.46.1.5.21.1	9! = 9 &#215; 8 &#215; 7 &#215; 6 &#215; 5 &#215; 4 &#215; 3 &#215; 2 &#215; 1 = 362,880
7.46.1.5.22.1	In other words, the probability of repeating the entire nine-letter sequence would be 1 out of 362,880.
7.46.1.5.22.2	That repeat would have an extremely low probability of occurring and would therefore be a highly significant event.
7.46.1.5.22.3	But what if the recorded sequence has only six of the nine cells firing in the proper order?
7.46.1.5.22.4	How do you determine the probability of that?
7.46.1.5.22.5	First, calculate the probability of a combination of six cells out of the nine.
7.46.1.5.22.6	So for the first cell you have nine choices, for the second you have eight choices, and so forth.
7.46.1.5.22.7	Then you have to calculate the probability of that combination of six cells being in the proper sequence, and that will be 1 out of the total number of possible arrangements of those six cells, or 6!.
7.46.1.5.22.8	Then what do you do for probabilities of successive events?
7.46.1.5.22.9	You multiply the probabilities.
7.46.1.5.22.10	For example, if you flip a coin, the probability of heads is 0.5.
7.46.1.5.22.11	If you flip it twice, the probability of getting heads both times is 0.5 &#215; 0.5, or 0.25.
7.46.1.5.23.1	QUESTIONS
7.46.1.5.24.1	What is the probability of the sequence 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 out of a random firing of nine cells?
7.46.1.5.25.1	What is the probability of a sequence of four letters occurring out of a random firing of nine cells?
7.46.1.5.26.1	Are both of the recordings from Questions 1 and 2 low-probability events?
7.46.1.5.27.1	What do you note about the time frame of the sequence during sleep versus during wakefulness?
7.46.1.5.28.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.46.1.6.1.1	The cerebrum is the dominant structure in the mammalian brain.
7.46.1.6.1.2	In humans it is so large that it covers all other parts of the brain except the cerebellum (Figure 46.4A).
7.46.1.6.1.3	Layers of cells at the surface of the cerebrum form the cerebral cortex, which is about 4 millimeters thick and is folded into ridges (gyri; singular gyrus) and valleys (sulci; singular sulcus).
7.46.1.6.1.4	If the cortex were flattened out, it would be about 1 square meter, but the foldings, or convolutions, enable that extensive surface area of cortex to fit within the skull.
7.46.1.6.1.5	Figure 46.4 The Human Cerebrum
7.46.1.6.2.1	As we explore the infoldings of the cerebral cortex and other parts of the brain, we will occasionally mention an individual whose brain was damaged by an accident or other unfortunate event.
7.46.1.6.2.2	Until recently the study of such individuals has been the main source of functional information about the human brain, but new imaging technologies such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are providing a wealth of new information and opportunities to study the human brain.
7.46.1.6.3.1	A curious feature of the human nervous system is that the left side of the body is served (in both sensory and motor aspects) mostly by the right side of the brain, and the right side of the body is served mostly by the left side of the brain.
7.46.1.6.3.2	Thus sensory input from the right hand goes to the left cerebral hemisphere, and sensory input from the left hand goes to the right cerebral hemisphere.
7.46.1.6.3.3	The exception is the head, where the left side is controlled by the left cerebral hemisphere and the right side by the right cerebral hemisphere.
7.46.1.6.3.4	The two hemispheres are not symmetrical with respect to all functions.
7.46.1.6.3.5	Language abilities, for example, reside predominantly in the left hemisphere in most people.
7.46.1.6.4.1	Different regions of the cerebral cortex have specific functions (Figure 46.4B).
7.46.1.6.4.2	Some of those functions are easily defined, such as receiving and processing sensory information or generating motor commands, but in most humans most of the cortex is involved in higher-order information processing that is less easy to define.
7.46.1.6.4.3	These latter areas are given the general name of association cortex, so named because they integrate, or associate, information from different sensory modalities and from memory.
7.46.1.6.5.1	To understand the cerebral cortex, it helps to have an anatomical road map.
7.46.1.6.5.2	Viewed from the left side, the left cerebral hemisphere looks like a boxing glove for the right hand with the fingers pointing forward, the thumb pointing out, and the wrist at the rear.
7.46.1.6.5.3	The &#8220;thumb&#8221; area is the temporal lobe, the fingers the frontal lobe, the back of the hand the parietal lobe, and the wrist the occipital lobe (see Figure 46.4A).
7.46.1.6.5.4	What you can&#8217;t see from the external view is the insular cortex, which is folded in between the thumb and finger areas of the boxing glove (between the frontal/parietal and the temporal lobes).
7.46.1.6.5.5	The right cerebral hemisphere shows a mirror image of this arrangement.
7.46.1.6.5.6	We will look at each lobe separately.
7.46.1.6.1.1.1	The upper region of the temporal lobe receives and processes auditory information.
7.46.1.6.1.1.2	The association areas of this lobe are involved in recognizing, identifying, and naming objects.
7.46.1.6.1.1.3	Damage to the temporal lobe results in disorders called agnosias, in which the individual is aware of an object but cannot identify it.
7.46.1.6.1.2.1	Damage to a specific region of the temporal lobe results in the inability to recognize faces.
7.46.1.6.1.2.2	Even old acquaintances cannot be identified by facial features, although they may be identified by other attributes such as voice, body features, and posture.
7.46.1.6.1.2.3	Damage to other association areas of the temporal lobe can cause deficits in understanding spoken language, although speaking, reading, and writing abilities may be intact.
7.46.1.6.2.1.1	The frontal and parietal lobes are separated by a deep valley called the central sulcus.
7.46.1.6.2.1.2	A strip of the frontal lobe cortex just in front of the central sulcus is called the primary motor cortex (see Figure 46.4B).
7.46.1.6.2.1.3	The neurons in this region control muscles in specific parts of the body; the parts of the body map onto the primary motor cortex, with the head represented in the lower outside region and the legs and feet in the top region near the midline.
7.46.1.6.2.1.4	The graphic drawing of body parts overlying the diagram of the cortex is called a homunculus, and its distortion represents disproportionate innervation.
7.46.1.6.2.1.5	Parts of the body with fine motor control, such as the face and hands, have disproportionate representation (Figure 46.5A).
7.46.1.6.2.1.6	Electrical stimulation of neurons in different regions of the primary motor cortex causes specific muscles of the body to twitch.
7.46.1.6.2.1.7	Just anterior to the primary motor cortex is the pre-motor cortex, which is involved in planning more complex and coordinated movements.
7.46.1.6.2.1.8	Figure 46.5 The Body Is Represented in Primary Motor and Primary Somatosensory Cortexes
7.46.1.6.2.2.1	The association functions of the frontal lobe are diverse and best described as having to do with feeling and planning.
7.46.1.6.2.2.2	They are said to have executive function and they contribute significantly to personality.
7.46.1.6.2.2.3	People with frontal lobe damage have drastic alterations of personality and difficulty planning future events.
7.46.1.6.2.2.4	A dramatic case of frontal lobe damage is that of Phineas Gage, who in 1848 was an industrious and responsible young railroad construction foreman.
7.46.1.6.2.2.5	Then a blasting accident shot a meter-long, 3-centimeter-wide iron tamping rod through his brain.
7.46.1.6.2.2.6	The rod entered Gage&#8217;s head below his left eye, passed through his frontal lobe, and exited the top of his head (Figure 46.6).
7.46.1.6.2.2.7	Figure 46.6 A Mind-Altering Experience
7.46.1.6.2.3.1	Remarkably, Gage survived, but he had a different personality.
7.46.1.6.2.3.2	In the years following his recovery, he was quarrelsome, impatient, obstinate, and used profane language, which he did not do before.
7.46.1.6.2.3.3	He lost his railroad job and earned money by telling his story and exhibiting his scars (and the tamping iron).
7.46.1.6.2.3.4	Several years later, however, he took a job as a stage coach driver in Chile   a challenging job indicating considerable behavioral recovery.
7.46.1.6.2.3.5	He died of a seizure in 1860, at the age of 38.
7.46.1.6.2.3.6	If you are in Boston, you can pay him a visit   his skull, death mask, and the tamping iron are on display in the Warren Anatomical Museum of Harvard Medical School.
7.46.1.6.3.1.1	The strip of parietal lobe cortex just behind the central sulcus is the primary somatosensory cortex (see Figure 46.4B).
7.46.1.6.3.1.2	This area receives touch and pressure information relayed from the body through the thalamus.
7.46.1.6.3.2.1	As with the primary motor cortex, the entire body surface can be mapped onto the primary somatosensory cortex (Figure 46.5B).
7.46.1.6.3.2.2	Areas of the body that have a high density of tactile mechanoreceptors and are capable of making fine discriminations in touch (such as the lips and fingers) have disproportionately large representation.
7.46.1.6.3.2.3	If a very small area of the primary somatosensory cortex is stimulated electrically, the subject reports feeling specific sensations, such as touch, in a localized part of the body.
7.46.1.6.3.3.1	A major association function of the parietal lobe is attending to complex stimuli.
7.46.1.6.3.3.2	Damage to the right parietal lobe causes a condition called contralateral neglect syndrome, in which the individual tends to ignore stimuli from the left side of the body or the left visual field.
7.46.1.6.3.3.3	Such individuals have difficulty performing complex tasks, such as dressing the left side of the body; an afflicted man may not be able to shave the left side of his face.
7.46.1.6.3.3.4	When asked to copy simple drawings, a person who exhibits this syndrome can do well with the right side of the drawing but not the left.
7.46.1.6.3.4.1	The parietal cortex is not symmetrical with respect to its role in attention.
7.46.1.6.3.4.2	Damage to the left parietal cortex does not cause the same degree of neglect of the right side of the body.
7.46.1.6.3.4.3	You will see similar asymmetries in cortical function later in the chapter when we discuss language.
7.46.1.6.4.1.1	The occipital lobe receives and processes visual information.
7.46.1.6.4.1.2	The association areas of the occipital cortex are essential for making sense of the visual world and translating visual experience into language.
7.46.1.6.4.1.3	Some deficits resulting from damage to these areas are specific.
7.46.1.6.4.1.4	In one case, a woman with limited damage was unable to see motion.
7.46.1.6.4.1.5	Her vision was intact, but she could see a waterfall only as a still image, and an approaching car only as a series of a stationary object at different distances.
7.46.1.6.5.1.1	The insular cortex, buried deep in the forebrain, receives a great variety of afferent information.
7.46.1.6.5.1.2	The posterior regions receive somatosensory information (e. g. , touch, pain, temperature); the middle region combines that with autonomic regulatory information and drives (e. g. , hunger, thirst, sex); and the anterior region, which is well developed in higher primates, elephants, and marine mammals, receives information about social interactions.
7.46.1.6.5.1.3	Thus in mammals the insular cortex appears to integrate physiological information from all over the body to create a sensation of how the body &#8220;feels,&#8221; and in the higher mammals it may extend that function into a sense of self.
7.46.1.7.1.1	Humans are sometimes called &#8220;big-brain primates,&#8221; and that is an accurate characterization.
7.46.1.7.1.2	Across vertebrate species there is a correlation between body size and brain size (Figure 46.7).
7.46.1.7.1.3	Higher primates such as chimpanzees, baboons, and gorillas all fall above this regression line, but humans stand out because they are so far above the regression line.
7.46.1.7.1.4	Gorillas are much larger than humans, but they have smaller brains.
7.46.1.7.1.5	Elephants and whales have large brains, but they fall closer to the regression line.
7.46.1.7.1.6	Dolphins and humans stand out as having much larger brains than would be predicted by their body sizes.
7.46.1.7.1.7	Figure 46.7 Evolution of the Human Brain
7.46.1.7.2.1	The correlation of brain size to body size does not tell the whole story of human brain evolution, however.
7.46.1.7.2.2	In Figure 44.15, which compares the brains of four vertebrates, we see that the forebrain is larger than other brain regions, and in mammals this is seen as an elaboration of the cerebral cortex.
7.46.1.7.2.3	If we look just at mammals, another feature is the degree of convolution of the cortex.
7.46.1.7.2.4	Since the cortex is a layered, two-dimensional array of neurons, the area of cortex is increased by convolutions, which are greatest in humans.
7.46.1.7.2.5	And finally, the percent of the cortex that is association cortex (i. e. , devoted to the integration of information) is by far the greatest in humans.
7.46.1.7.2.6	It is these evolutionary changes, primarily in the cortex, that provide the resources for the intellectual capacity of humans   a topic to which we will return at the end of the chapter.
7.46.1.7.3.1	46.1 recap
7.46.1.7.4.1	The central nervous system communicates with the rest of the body through the peripheral nervous system.
7.46.1.7.4.2	We are conscious of some sensory information coming into the CNS, but we are not conscious of other afferent information used in physiological regulation.
7.46.1.7.4.3	The brain develops from the anterior region of the embryonic neural tube.
7.46.1.7.4.4	The forebrain gives rise to the cerebrum, which is divided into five lobes.
7.46.1.7.4.5	Specific functions such as somatosensation, vision, hearing, motor control, smell, and speech are localized in specific cortical areas.
7.46.1.7.4.6	At the center of the cerebrum is the limbic system which contributes to the processing of emotions, inborn responses, and some types of memory.
7.46.1.7.4.7	Underneath the cerebrum is the hypothalamus, responsible for many autonomic functions, and the thalamus, which directs ascending information to the cortex.
7.46.1.7.4.8	The midbrain and hindbrain constitute the brainstem, within which are located many nuclei that support autonomic functions, including sleep and wakefulness.
7.46.1.7.4.9	Evolution of the human brain has resulted in a greatly increased cerebral cortex devoted to integration of information.
7.46.1.7.5.1	learning outcomes
7.46.1.7.6.1	You should be able to:
7.46.1.7.7.1	Describe and classify the types of afferent information to and efferent information from the nervous system.
7.46.1.7.8.1	Describe the developmental relationships between the major brain regions, starting with the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain and ending with structures such as the amygdala, hypothalamus, primary motor cortex, reticular-activating system, and other components of the adult brain.
7.46.1.7.9.1	Sketch the five lobes of the cerebrum and identify the primary sensory and motor areas.
7.46.1.7.10.1	Characterize the human brain in comparison to other mammals.
7.46.1.7.11.1	Given your understanding of afferent and efferent systems operating in the nervous system, give examples of brain   body feedback loops that influence each of the following:
7.46.1.7.12.1	Voluntary behavior through a conscious sensory stimulus
7.46.1.7.13.1	Involuntary responses through a conscious sensory stimulus
7.46.1.7.14.1	Involuntary responses through an unconscious stimulus
7.46.1.7.15.1	In the developmental and lethal disorder anencephaly, the anterior-most region of the developing neural tube fails to close.
7.46.1.7.15.2	Explain what impact this has on development of specific brain
7.46.1.7.16.1	What is significant about the location of the reading and language areas of the cerebral cortex as shown in Figure 46.4B
7.46.1.7.17.1	Key Concept 45.3 described the two-point spatial discrimination test.
7.46.1.7.17.2	How do the typical results of that test relate to Figure 46.5B?
7.46.1.7.18.1	The brain size of humans is significantly above the regression line for brain size as a function of body size in most other mammals.
7.46.1.7.18.2	Why is this observation an understatement of the difference in cerebral cortical capacity in humans as compared with other mammals?
7.46.1.7.19.1	Having briefly described the structure and function of different regions of the nervous system, we will now explore some examples of how information is processed by the neural circuitry in some specific brain regions.
7.46.1.7.20.1	Chapter 46 continues with
7.46.1.7.21.1	46.2 Nervous System Functions Rely on Neural Circuits
7.46.2.1.1	Pathways of the autonomic nervous system control involuntary physiological functions
7.46.2.2.1	The visual system is an example of information integration by the cerebral cortex
7.46.2.3.1	Three-dimensional vision results from cortical cells receiving input from both eyes
7.46.2.4.1	Specific functions are localized in specific parts of the nervous system and depend on the neural circuits, or networks, in those structures.
7.46.2.4.2	A major focus of modern neuroscience is to understand how the various functions of the nervous system, ranging from simple reflexes to complex learning and memory, are accomplished by the interactions of neurons in circuits.
7.46.2.4.3	Two extensively studied examples of how neural networks process information are the autonomic nervous system (an output pathway) and the visual system (an input pathway).
7.46.2.5.1	focus your learning
7.46.2.6.1	To control involuntary autonomic responses, the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system have distinct circuitry and typically induce opposite functional responses from target organs and tissues.
7.46.2.7.1	Visual information is transduced in the retina via center-surround receptive fields, resulting in patterns of action potential firing in ganglion cells that are transmitted to the visual cortex via the thalamus.
7.46.2.8.1	Binocular neurons in the visual cortex receive input from both eyes and thereby enable depth perception in humans.
7.46.2.1.1.1	The autonomic nervous system, or ANS, includes CNS and PNS components and controls many involuntary functions, such as heart rate, blood flow, sweating, and digestive activities.
7.46.2.1.1.2	Its control of diverse organs and tissues is crucial to homeostasis.
7.46.2.1.1.3	The ANS has two divisions, sympathetic and parasympathetic, that work in opposition to each other in their effects on most organs (Figure 46.8).
7.46.2.1.1.4	The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions are easily distinguished by their anatomy, neurotransmitters, and actions.
7.46.2.1.1.5	Figure 46.8 The Autonomic Nervous System
7.46.2.1.2.1	The best-known functions of the ANS are those of the sympathetic division that produce the fight-or-flight response: increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output and which prepares the body for emergencies (see Figure 40.3).
7.46.2.1.2.2	In contrast, the parasympathetic division slows the heart and lowers blood pressure; its actions have been characterized as &#8220;rest and digest. &#8221; It is tempting to think of the sympathetic division as speeding things up and the parasympathetic division as slowing things down, but it is not that simple; for example, the sympathetic division slows down the digestive system whereas the parasympathetic division accelerates it.
7.46.2.1.3.1	Whether sympathetic or parasympathetic, every autonomic efferent pathway begins with a cholinergic neuron (that is, a neuron that uses acetylcholine as its neurotransmitter) that has its cell body in the brainstem or spinal cord.
7.46.2.1.3.2	These cells are called preganglionic neurons because the second neuron in the pathway with which they synapse resides in a collection of neurons outside the CNS called a ganglion (plural ganglia).
7.46.2.1.3.3	The second neuron is called a postganglionic neuron because its axon extends out from the ganglion.
7.46.2.1.3.4	The axon of the postganglionic neuron synapses with cells in the target organs (see Figure 46.8).
7.46.2.1.4.1	The postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic division mostly use norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) as their neurotransmitter.
7.46.2.1.4.2	In contrast, the postganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic division are mostly cholinergic.
7.46.2.1.4.3	In organs that receive both sympathetic and parasympathetic input, the target cells respond in an opposite manner to norepinephrine and to acetylcholine.
7.46.2.1.4.4	This happens, for example, in a region of the heart called the pacemaker, which initiates the heartbeat.
7.46.2.1.4.5	Stimulating the sympathetic nerve to the heart or dripping norepinephrine onto pacemaker cells increases their firing rate and causes the heart to beat faster.
7.46.2.1.4.6	In contrast, stimulating the parasympathetic nerve to the heart or dripping acetylcholine onto pacemaker cells decreases their firing rate and causes the heart to beat more slowly (see Figure 49.7).
7.46.2.1.5.1	The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the ANS can also be distinguished by anatomy.
7.46.2.1.5.2	The preganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic division come from the cranial nerves of the brainstem and the sacral (lowest) region of the spinal cord; those of the sympathetic division come from the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord (see Figure 46.8).
7.46.2.1.5.3	Most of the ganglia of the sympathetic division are lined up and interconnected in two chains, one on either side of the spinal cord.
7.46.2.1.5.4	The parasympathetic ganglia are close to the target organs and are not interconnected.
7.46.2.1.6.1	The ANS is an important link between the CNS and many physiological functions.
7.46.2.1.6.2	Its control of diverse organs and tissues is crucial to homeostasis.
7.46.2.1.6.3	Despite the complexity of the ANS, work by neurobiologists and physiologists over many decades has made it possible to understand its functions in terms of neuronal properties and circuits.
7.46.2.2.1.1	The visual system is one of the most-studied input pathways to the CNS.
7.46.2.2.1.2	Key Concept 45.4 described how light falling on the retina produces signals that are transmitted through the cellular circuits of the retina, resulting in action potentials in the optic nerve.
7.46.2.2.1.3	But how does the brain use this information to represent the visual world?
7.46.2.2.1.1.1	Key Concept 45.4 described how a retinal ganglion cell collects information from several photoreceptors   an example of &#8220;convergence of information. &#8221; Each ganglion cell is communicating to the brain something more than simply the presence or absence or intensity of light falling on a portion of the retina.
7.46.2.2.1.2.1	The question of what information the retinal ganglion cell extracts from the photoreceptors was addressed in classic experiments by Stephen Kuffler, then at Johns Hopkins University.
7.46.2.2.1.2.2	He used electrodes to record the activity of single ganglion cells of cat eyes while stimulating their retinas with spots of light (Figure 46.9).
7.46.2.2.1.2.3	Kuffler&#8217;s experiments revealed that each ganglion cell has a well-defined receptive field composed of a group of photoreceptor cells that receive light from a small area of the entire visual field.
7.46.2.2.1.2.4	Stimulating these photoreceptors with light activates the ganglion cell, which sends action potentials to the thalamus and on to the visual cortex (the area of the occipital lobe where visual information is processed; see Figure 46.4).
7.46.2.2.1.2.5	Information from many photoreceptors is therefore communicated to the brain as a single message.
7.46.2.2.1.2.6	Individual photoreceptors may contribute to the receptive fields of multiple ganglion cells, so that receptive fields overlap.

7.46.2.2.1.5.3	Journal of Neurophysiology 16: 37   68.
7.46.2.2.1.6.1	Stephen Kuffler&#8217;s experiments recorded the activity of single ganglion cells in the eyes of cats.
7.46.2.2.1.6.2	These groundbreaking experiments revealed the existence of a circular receptive field for each of the retina&#8217;s ganglion cells.
7.46.2.2.1.6.3	Signals from photoreceptor cells in a receptive field are either excitatory or inhibitory to the ganglion cell, which sends action potentials via the optic nerve to the brain.
7.46.2.2.1.7.1	HYPOTHESIS Retinal ganglion cells are excited or inhibited by light and dark stimuli falling on local areas of the retina.
7.46.2.2.1.8.1	METHOD
7.46.2.2.1.9.1	Place electrodes next to an individual retinal ganglion cell.
7.46.2.2.1.10.1	Stimulate the retina with different combinations of light and dark stimuli and record the responses of the ganglion cell.
7.46.2.2.1.11.1	Continue recording and move the stimuli around the retina to find the area of sensitivity   the receptive field   for a specific ganglion cell.
7.46.2.2.1.12.1	RESULTS
7.46.2.2.1.13.1	CONCLUSION Ganglion cells use a center-surround dichotomy to encode patterns of contrast between light and dark.
7.46.2.2.1.14.1	Q: Why is there a blind spot in each eye?
7.46.2.2.1.15.1	The receptive fields of most ganglion cells are circular, but whether a spot of light falling on a receptive field excites or inhibits its ganglion cell depends both on the nature of the receptive field and on where the spot of light falls on it.
7.46.2.2.1.15.2	Receptive fields have a center and a concentric surround, and can be either &#8220;on-center&#8221; or &#8220;off-center. &#8221; Light falling on the center of an on-center receptive field excites the ganglion cell, and light falling on the center of an off-center receptive field inhibits the ganglion cell.
7.46.2.2.1.15.3	Light falling on the surround has the opposite effect: the surround for an on-center receptive field inhibits the ganglion cell, and the surround for an off-center field is excitatory.
7.46.2.2.1.15.4	Thus the activity of the ganglion cell reflects how much of the light stimulus is on the center and how much is on the surround of its receptive field (see Figure 46.9).
7.46.2.2.1.16.1	Center effects are always stronger than surround effects.
7.46.2.2.1.16.2	Thus a small dot of light directly on the center of a receptive field has the maximum effect, and a larger light stimulus illuminating the center and parts of the surround has a smaller effect.
7.46.2.2.1.16.3	A uniform patch of light falling equally on the center and surround has very little effect on the firing rate of the ganglion cell for that receptive field.
7.46.2.2.1.16.4	The center and surround almost exactly cancel one another, even though the area of the surround is much larger.
7.46.2.2.1.17.1	As is seen in Figure 46.9, photoreceptors synapse onto bipolar cells and bipolar cells onto ganglion cells.
7.46.2.2.1.17.2	This pattern of connectivity describes the relationship between the photoreceptors in the center of a receptive field.
7.46.2.2.1.17.3	The photoreceptors in the surround area modify communication between the center photoreceptors and their bipolar cells through the lateral connections of horizontal cells and amacrine cells.
7.46.2.2.1.17.4	Thus the receptive field of a ganglion cell results from a pattern of synapses between photoreceptors, horizontal cells, amacrine cells, and bipolar cells.
7.46.2.2.1.17.5	A general lesson to learn from this seemingly confusing chain of events is that inhibition can be as important as excitation in neural circuits.
7.46.2.2.1.18.1	In summary, the neural circuitry of the retina results in the generation of signals in the axons of the optic nerve that communicate simple information about the contrasting patterns of light and dark falling on different parts of the retina.
7.46.2.2.1.18.2	But once the action potentials in the optic nerve reach their destinations, how does the brain integrate them to construct visual images of the outside world?
7.46.2.2.2.1.1	The axons of the optic nerves terminate in a region of the thalamus that is a relay station receiving information from both the right and left eyes.
7.46.2.2.2.1.2	From the thalamus, the information encoded in the activity of axons in the optic nerves is relayed to the visual cortex in the occipital lobes at the back of the brain.
7.46.2.2.2.1.3	In the 1960s David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel of Harvard University studied the activity of neurons in the visual cortex by shining spots and bars of light on retinas while recording the activities of single cells in the cortex.
7.46.2.2.2.1.4	They found that many neurons in the visual cortex, like retinal ganglion cells, have receptive fields with regions that are mutually antagonistic.
7.46.2.2.2.2.1	Hubel and Weisel discovered that neurons in the visual cortex respond selectively to bars of light of different orientations falling on the retina, and in some cases to movement of those bars of light in different directions.
7.46.2.2.2.2.2	The concept that emerges from these experiments is that the brain assembles a mental image of the visual world by analyzing edges in patterns of light falling on the retina.
7.46.2.2.2.2.3	Each retina sends a million axons to the brain, but there are hundreds of millions of neurons in the visual cortex.
7.46.2.2.2.2.4	The action potentials from one retinal ganglion cell are received via the thalamus by hundreds of cortical neurons, each responsive to a different combination of orientation, position, color, and movement of contrasting lines in the patterns of light and dark falling on the retina.
7.46.2.3.1.1	How do we perceive objects in three dimensions?
7.46.2.3.1.2	The short answer is that our two eyes see overlapping, yet slightly different, visual fields   that is, humans have binocular vision.
7.46.2.3.1.3	A person who is blind in one eye has difficulty discriminating distances.
7.46.2.3.1.4	Animals whose eyes are on the sides of the head rather than facing front have minimal overlap in their fields of vision and, as a result, poor depth vision except for a narrow field straight ahead; however, they can see predators creeping up from all sides.
7.46.2.3.2.1	The story of how the brain integrates information from two eyes begins with the paths of the optic nerves.
7.46.2.3.2.2	The two optic nerves run along the underside of the brain, join just under the hypothalamus, and then separate again (Focus: Key Figure 46.10).
7.46.2.3.2.3	The place where they join is called the optic chiasm.
7.46.2.3.2.4	Axons from the half of each retina closest to the nose cross in the optic chiasm and go to the opposite side of the brain.
7.46.2.3.2.5	The axons from the outer half of each retina do not cross over at the optic chiasm; axons from the outer left retina go to the left side of the brain, and vice versa for axons from the outer right retina.
7.46.2.3.3.1	focus: key figure
7.46.2.3.4.1	Figure 46.10 How Do We See in 3-D?
7.46.2.3.5.1	(A) Our eyes have largely overlapping visual fields, and both eyes transmit information to both sides of the brain.
7.46.2.3.5.2	However, because the axons from the inner sides of the retinas cross at the optic chiasm, information from the visual space to the left of straight ahead goes to the right side of the brain, and information from the visual space to the right of straight ahead goes to the left side of the brain.
7.46.2.3.5.3	(B) Between these left and right eye columns of neurons are neurons that receive input from both eyes.
7.46.2.3.5.4	These are the binocular cells.
7.46.2.3.5.5	(C) Light from objects that are different distances away will fall at different locations on the retinas.
7.46.2.3.5.6	These disparities between where the image of the fixation point and the images of other objects fall on the retina means that different binocular cells will receive input from different retinal axons depending on how far away the object is.
7.46.2.3.5.7	These disparity sensitive cells enable depth perception and 3-D vision.
7.46.2.3.6.1	Q: What would be the consequences of an anterior   posterior cut of the optic chiasm on midline?
7.46.2.3.7.1	The functional consequence of the optic chiasm is that all of the visual information from the left side of your field of vision when you are looking straight ahead goes to the right side of your brain, and all of the visual information from the right side of your field of vision goes to the left side of your brain.
7.46.2.3.7.2	However, there is a very large area of overlap between the visual fields of the two eyes.
7.46.2.3.7.3	These relationships are shown in purple and green in Figure 46.10.
7.46.2.3.8.1	Because of the overlap between the visual fields of the two eyes, there can be neurons in the visual cortex that receive input from both the left and the right eye.
7.46.2.3.8.2	These are called binocular cells, and they can detect disparity between where the image of an object falls on the two retinas.
7.46.2.3.8.3	What is disparity?
7.46.2.3.8.4	Hold your finger out in front of you and look at it closing one eye and then the other.
7.46.2.3.8.5	Your finger appears to jump back and forth because its image falls on a different position on each retina.
7.46.2.3.8.6	Repeat the exercise with a distant object.
7.46.2.3.8.7	It doesn&#8217;t jump back and forth as much because there is less disparity in the positions of the image on the two retinas.
7.46.2.3.8.8	Certain binocular cells respond optimally to a stimulus falling on both retinas with a particular disparity.
7.46.2.3.8.9	Which set of binocular cells is stimulated depends on how far away the stimulus is.
7.46.2.3.9.1	When we look at something, we can detect its shape, color, depth, and movement.
7.46.2.3.9.2	Where does all this information come together?
7.46.2.3.9.3	Is there a single cell that fires only when a red sports car drives by?
7.46.2.3.9.4	The answer to that is probably no. Visual experience comes from simultaneous activity in many different cells.
7.46.2.3.9.5	In addition, most visual experiences are enhanced by information from the other senses and from memory, which helps explain why about 75 percent of the cerebral cortex is association cortex.
7.46.2.3.10.1	46.2 recap
7.46.2.3.11.1	Information in the nervous system is processed by cellular interactions in neural networks.
7.46.2.3.11.2	The opposing actions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the ANS can be understood in terms of neural pathways consisting of just two neurons.
7.46.2.3.11.3	Vision begins with retinal photoreceptors organized into circular retinal receptive fields that influence the activity of retinal ganglion cells.
7.46.2.3.11.4	Information from ganglion cells is transmitted in the optic nerves to the thalamus and relayed from there to the visual cortex.
7.46.2.3.11.5	The left visual field from both eyes is represented in the right visual cortex, and vice versa for the right visual field.
7.46.2.3.11.6	Receptive fields of cortical cells represent input from multiple ganglion cells, and binocular, disparity-sensitive cortical cells enable depth perception.
7.46.2.3.12.1	learning outcomes
7.46.2.3.13.1	You should be able to:
7.46.2.3.14.1	Predict the outcome on effector tissues when specific peripheral nerves of the sympathetic or parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system are damaged or stimulated.
7.46.2.3.15.1	Explain how receptive fields are generated in the retina through the interactions between photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells, and through the modulation of their signaling by horizontal and amacrine cells.
7.46.2.3.16.1	Understand how neural connections between the eyes and the visual cortex produce three-dimensional vision.
7.46.2.3.17.1	Explain how a knife wound to left side of the neck can result in pupillary constriction in the left eye.
7.46.2.3.18.1	Why can a small spot of light on the retina cause a larger response in a retinal ganglion cell than a large spot of light falling on the same area of retina?
7.46.2.3.19.1	What changes in vision would occur if the optic chiasm were cut right on the midline?
7.46.2.3.20.1	By studying the neural circuitry of the visual system and the ANS, you have gained some understanding of how information reaches the CNS and how the CNS controls various functions of the body.
7.46.2.3.20.2	But what about the higher functions of the mammalian CNS   the complex functions between input and output, such as language, learning, memory, and dreams?
7.46.2.3.21.1	Chapter 46 continues with
7.46.2.3.22.1	46.3 Higher Brain Functions Involve Integration of Multiple Systems
7.46.3.1.1	Sleep and dreaming are reflected in electrical patterns in the cerebral cortex
7.46.3.2.1	Language abilities are localized in the left cerebral hemisphere
7.46.3.3.1	Some learning and memory can be localized to specific brain areas
7.46.3.4.1	We still cannot answer the question &#8220;What is consciousness?&#8221;
7.46.3.5.1	The higher brain functions discussed in the remaining pages of this chapter are undeniably complex.
7.46.3.5.2	Nevertheless, neuroscientists, using a wide range of techniques, are making considerable progress in understanding these functions in terms of their cellular, molecular, and network properties.
7.46.3.5.3	The following discussion will address several aspects of brain and behavior that present challenges to neuroscientists: sleep and dreaming, learning and memory, language use, and consciousness.
7.46.3.6.1	focus your learning
7.46.3.7.1	During wakefulness and REM sleep (dreaming), certain brainstem nuclei provide excitatory input that activates the thalamus and cortex, while in non-REM sleep these nuclei are less active.
7.46.3.8.1	Sleep states are divided into slow-wave sleep (non-REM) and REM sleep, and humans alternate between these states four or five times each night.
7.46.3.9.1	Sleep deprivation impairs cognitive functions.
7.46.3.10.1	Language functions are lateralized (typically within the left cerebral hemisphere).
7.46.3.10.2	Language ability involves parts of the occipital, parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes.
7.46.3.11.1	The cellular correlate for learning and memory is the modification of synaptic strength.
7.46.3.11.2	The hippocampus is important for acquiring and consolidating declarative memories.
7.46.3.12.1	In humans and higher mammals, the insular lobe integrates physiological information to generate a conscious awareness of the self.
7.46.3.1.1.1	A dominant feature of behavior is the daily cycle of sleep and waking.
7.46.3.1.1.2	All birds and mammals, probably all other vertebrates, and also many invertebrates, sleep.
7.46.3.1.1.3	We humans spend one-third of our lives sleeping, yet we do not know why or how.
7.46.3.1.1.4	We do know, however, that we need to sleep.
7.46.3.1.1.5	Loss of sleep impairs alertness and performance.
7.46.3.1.1.6	Many people in our society   certainly most college students   are chronically sleep-deprived.
7.46.3.1.1.7	Accidents and serious mistakes that endanger lives can be attributed to impaired alertness caused by lack of sleep.
7.46.3.1.1.8	Insomnia (difficulty in falling or staying asleep) is one of the most common medical complaints.
7.46.3.1.1.1.1	A common tool of sleep researchers is the electroencephalogram, or EEG.
7.46.3.1.1.1.2	Rather than recording the activity of single neurons, the EEG characterizes activity in huge numbers of neurons.
7.46.3.1.1.1.3	EEG electrodes are much larger than the fine electrodes used to detect single cell activity.
7.46.3.1.1.1.4	Placed at different locations on the head and scalp (Figure 46.11A), EEG electrodes record fluctuations in the electric potential differences between electrodes over time.
7.46.3.1.1.1.5	These differences reflect the electrical activity of the neurons in the brain regions under the electrodes, primarily regions of the cerebral cortex.
7.46.3.1.1.1.6	Usually the electrical activity of one or more skeletal muscles is also recorded; this record is called an electromyogram (EMG).
7.46.3.1.1.1.7	Movements of the eyes are recorded as an electroocculogram (EOG).
7.46.3.1.1.1.8	Figure 46.11 Stages of Sleep
7.46.3.1.1.2.1	EEG, EMG, and EOG patterns reveal the transition from being awake to being asleep.
7.46.3.1.1.2.2	They also reveal that there are different states of sleep.
7.46.3.1.1.2.3	In mammals other than humans, two major sleep states are easily distinguished: slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.
7.46.3.1.1.2.4	Slow-wave sleep gets its name from the high-amplitude, slow-frequency waves in the EEG.
7.46.3.1.1.2.5	REM sleep gets its name from jerky movements of the eyeballs that occur during this state.
7.46.3.1.1.2.6	In humans, sleep states are characterized as non-REM sleep and REM sleep.
7.46.3.1.1.2.7	Human non-REM sleep is divided into three stages.
7.46.3.1.1.3.1	When you fall asleep, you first enter stage 1 non-REM sleep, which then progresses through stage 2 to stage 3 (Figure 46.11B).
7.46.3.1.1.3.2	Stage 3 is deep, restorative, slow-wave sleep.
7.46.3.1.1.3.3	This first full cycle of non-REM sleep is followed by an episode of REM sleep.
7.46.3.1.1.3.4	Throughout the night you experience four or five cycles of non-REM and REM sleep (Figure 46.11C).
7.46.3.1.1.3.5	About 80 percent of your sleep is non-REM sleep.
7.46.3.1.1.3.6	The most vivid dreams and nightmares occur during the 20 percent of sleep that is REM sleep.
7.46.3.1.2.1.1	When we are awake, several nuclei (groups of neurons) in the brainstem reticular-activating system are continuously active.
7.46.3.1.2.1.2	Axons from neurons in these nuclei extend to the thalamus and throughout the cerebral cortex, where they release depolarizing neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, norepinephrine, and serotonin).
7.46.3.1.2.1.3	These broadly distributed neurotransmitters keep the resting potential of the neurons of the thalamus and cortex close to threshold and sensitive to synaptic inputs, thereby maintaining the responsiveness of the brain that characterizes being awake.
7.46.3.1.2.2.1	With the onset of sleep, activity in these brainstem nuclei decreases, and their axon terminals release less neurotransmitter.
7.46.3.1.2.2.2	With the withdrawal of the depolarizing neurotransmitters, the resting potentials of the cells of the thalamus and cortex become more negative (hyperpolarized), and the cells are less sensitive to excitatory synaptic input.
7.46.3.1.2.2.3	Their processing of information is inhibited, and consciousness is lost.
7.46.3.1.2.2.4	You have probably experienced this as &#8220;nodding off. &#8221; As you enter non-REM sleep, cells of the cortex begin to fire action potentials in bursts.
7.46.3.1.2.2.5	The synchronization of these bursts over broad areas of cerebral cortex results in the EEG slow-wave pattern that characterizes deep non-REM sleep.
7.46.3.1.2.3.1	At the transition from non-REM to REM sleep, dramatic changes occur.
7.46.3.1.2.3.2	Some of the brainstem nuclei that were inactive during non-REM sleep become active again, causing a general depolarization of cortical neurons.
7.46.3.1.2.3.3	Thus in REM sleep the synchronized bursts of firing cease, and the EEG resembles that of the awake brain.
7.46.3.1.2.3.4	Because the resting potentials of the neurons return to near threshold levels, the cortex can process information, and vivid dreams occur.
7.46.3.1.2.4.1	So why don&#8217;t we act out our dreams?
7.46.3.1.2.4.2	During REM sleep the brain inhibits both afferent (sensory) and efferent (motor) pathways; we are paralyzed during REM sleep.
7.46.3.1.2.4.3	Limb twitches and the jerky eye movements are motor signals breaking through the inhibition.
7.46.3.1.2.4.4	The bizarre nature of dreams may be due to the lack of sensory feedback to the cortex from the body and the outside world.
7.46.3.1.2.4.5	In other words, a functioning cortex is out of touch with reality.
7.46.3.1.2.4.6	The function of muscle paralysis during REM sleep may be to prevent the acting out of dreams.
7.46.3.1.2.5.1	Knowing the cellular mechanisms of sleep has not yet led to an understanding of its function.
7.46.3.1.2.5.2	Many questions remain.
7.46.3.1.2.5.3	Why do we have two sleep states with very different neurophysiological characteristics?
7.46.3.1.2.5.4	Why does non-REM sleep always occur first?
7.46.3.1.2.5.5	Why do the two states cycle during the rest phase?
7.46.3.1.2.5.6	We know sleep is essential for life, but we don&#8217;t know why.
7.46.3.1.2.5.7	One set of hypotheses is that sleep is necessary for the maintenance and repair of neural connections and for the neural changes involved in learning and memory   and possibly forgetting.
7.46.3.1.2.5.8	These hypotheses are supported by many experiments showing that performance of a learned task or recall of declarative information on the day following training is impaired if sleep is prevented, and is best following a good night&#8217;s sleep.
7.46.3.2.1.1	No aspect of brain function is as integrally related to human consciousness and intellect as language.
7.46.3.2.1.2	Therefore brain mechanisms that underlie the acquisition and use of language are extremely interesting to neuroscientists.
7.46.3.2.1.3	A curious observation about language ability is that it resides in one cerebral hemisphere   which in 97 percent of people is the left hemisphere.
7.46.3.2.1.4	This phenomenon is referred to as the lateralization of language functions.
7.46.3.2.2.1	Fascinating research on this subject was conducted by Roger Sperry and his colleagues at the California Institute of Technology.
7.46.3.2.2.2	The two cerebral hemispheres are connected by a tract of white matter called the corpus callosum.
7.46.3.2.2.3	In one severe form of epilepsy, bursts of action potentials causing seizures travel between hemispheres via the corpus callosum.
7.46.3.2.2.4	Cutting the tract eliminates the problem, and patients function well following surgery.
7.46.3.2.2.5	However, these &#8220;split-brain&#8221; subjects display interesting deficits in language ability.
7.46.3.2.3.1	After the surgery, if an object is shown in the right visual field and the left eye is closed (see Figure 46.10), the patient can describe it verbally and in writing.
7.46.3.2.3.2	If the object is shown in the left visual field and the right eye is closed, the patient cannot describe it either verbally or in writing, but can use his or her left hand to point to a picture of the object.
7.46.3.2.3.3	Without the connecting tissue between the two hemispheres, knowledge or experience of the right hemisphere can no longer be expressed in language.
7.46.3.2.4.1	Individuals who have suffered damage to the left hemisphere frequently suffer from some form of aphasia, a deficit in the ability to use or understand words.
7.46.3.2.4.2	Studies of such individuals have identified several language areas in the left hemisphere.
7.46.3.2.5.1	Broca&#8217;s area, located in the frontal lobe just in front of the primary motor cortex, is essential for speech.
7.46.3.2.5.2	Damage to Broca&#8217;s area results in halting, slow, poorly articulated speech or even complete loss of speech, but the patient can still read and understand language.
7.46.3.2.6.1	Wernicke&#8217;s area, located in the temporal lobe close to its border with the occipital lobe, is more involved with sensory than with motor aspects of language.
7.46.3.2.6.2	Damage to Wernicke&#8217;s area can cause a person to lose the ability to speak sensibly while retaining the abilities to form the sounds of normal speech and to imitate its cadence.
7.46.3.2.6.3	Such a patient cannot understand spoken or written language.
7.46.3.2.7.1	The angular gyrus, located near Wernicke&#8217;s area, is involved in integrating spoken and written language.
7.46.3.2.7.2	Figure 46.12 Language Areas of the Cortex Figure 46.13 Imaging Techniques Reveal Active Parts of the Brain
7.46.3.2.8.1	Normal language ability depends on the flow of information among various areas of the left cerebral cortex.
7.46.3.2.8.2	Input from spoken language travels from the auditory cortex to Wernicke&#8217;s area (Figure 46.12A).
7.46.3.2.8.3	Input from written language travels from the visual cortex to the angular gyrus to Wernicke&#8217;s area (Figure 46.12B).
7.46.3.2.8.4	Commands to speak are formulated in Wernicke&#8217;s area and travel to Broca&#8217;s area and from there to the primary motor cortex.
7.46.3.2.8.5	Damage to any one of those areas or the pathways between them can result in aphasia.
7.46.3.2.8.6	Using modern methods of brain imaging such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or positron emission tomography (PET), it is possible to see the metabolic activity in different brain areas when the brain is using language (Figure 46.13).
7.46.3.3.1.1	Learning is the modification of behavior by experience.
7.46.3.3.1.2	Memory is the ability of the nervous system to retain what is learned and experienced.
7.46.3.3.1.3	Even very simple animals can learn and remember, but these two abilities are most highly developed in humans.
7.46.3.3.1.4	Consider the amount of information associated with learning a language, and then the much greater amount of information that language enables our brains to store and to process.
7.46.3.3.1.5	The capacity of memory and the rate at which memories can be retrieved are remarkable features of the human nervous system.
7.46.3.3.2.1	Learning that leads to long-term memory and modification of behavior must involve long-lasting synaptic changes.
7.46.3.3.2.2	A phenomenon that may explain how long-term synaptic changes might arise is long-term potentiation, or LTP.
7.46.3.3.2.3	LTP results from high-frequency electrical stimulation of certain identifiable circuits that makes these circuits more sensitive to subsequent stimulation.
7.46.3.3.2.4	In contrast, continuous, repetitive, low-level stimulation of these same circuits reduces their responsiveness, a phenomenon that has been called long-term depression (LTD).
7.46.3.3.2.5	LTP and LTD may be fundamental cellular or molecular mechanisms involved in learning and memory.
7.46.3.3.3.1	Above the level of the synapse, memory involves interactions between several brain areas, as we discussed in the opener to this chapter and in Investigating Life: Places Cells Reveal Processes of Memory Consolidation during Sleep.
7.46.3.3.3.2	Some of the first insights into memory processes came from surgical treatment of patients with severe seizures.
7.46.3.3.3.3	That treatment involves destruction of the excessively active brain area triggering the seizures.
7.46.3.3.3.4	To find the right area, the surgery is done under local anesthesia, with the patient remaining conscious.
7.46.3.3.3.5	As different regions of the brain are electrically stimulated with electrodes, the patient reports the resulting sensations.
7.46.3.3.3.6	Stimulation of some regions of the association cortex elicits recall of vivid memories.
7.46.3.3.3.7	Such observations provided the first evidence that specific areas in the brain are associated with specific memories and that memory can be attributed to networks of neurons.
7.46.3.3.3.8	Destroying a small area of the brain does not completely erase a memory, however, so it is postulated that memory is a function distributed over many brain regions and can be stimulated via many different routes.
7.46.3.3.4.1	You experience several forms of memory everyday.
7.46.3.3.4.2	You have immediate memory for events that are happening now.
7.46.3.3.4.3	Immediate memory is almost perfectly photographic but lasts only seconds.
7.46.3.3.4.4	Short-term memory contains less information but lasts longer   on the order of 10   15 minutes.
7.46.3.3.4.5	When you are introduced to a group of several new people, you probably will have forgotten their names in an hour or so if you have not written them down, used them in a conversation, or made a conscious effort to repeat them.
7.46.3.3.4.6	Repetition, use, or reinforcement by something that gets your attention (a title such as &#8220;President,&#8221; for example) facilitates the transfer of short-term memory to long-term memory, which can last for days, months, years, or a lifetime.
7.46.3.3.4.7	There is also intermediate-term memory, which lasts about a day.
7.46.3.3.5.1	Knowledge about neural mechanisms for the transfer of short-term memory to long-term memory   memory consolidation   has come from observations of persons who have lost parts of the limbic system, notably the hippocampus.
7.46.3.3.5.2	A famous case is that of the man identified as H.M., whose hippocampus on both sides of the brain was removed to control his severe epilepsy.
7.46.3.3.5.3	After the surgery, H.M. was unable to transfer information to long-term memory.
7.46.3.3.5.4	If someone was introduced to him, had a conversation with him, and then left the room for several minutes, when that person returned, H.M did not recognize him   it was as if the conversation had never taken place.
7.46.3.3.5.5	Up until his death 55 years later, H.M. remembered events that happened before his surgery but could not remember postsurgery events for more than 10   15 minutes.
7.46.3.3.6.1	The studies of H.M., other such patients, and experiments on animals and even London taxi drivers show that the hippocampus plays an essential role in the acquisition of declarative memories   those that involve people, places, things, and events.
7.46.3.3.6.2	The study featured in the opener to this chapter revealed the mapping of spatial information by neural networks in the rat, and the replay of that information when the rat is resting before or after running a maze.
7.46.3.3.6.3	Subsequent experiments revealed the replay of the same spatial information during sleep, possibly revealing a process that is consolidating the memory and transferring it into long-term storage (see Investigating Life: Place Cells Reveal Processes of Memory Consolidation during Sleep).
7.46.3.4.1.1	This chapter has only scratched the surface of the organization and functions of the human brain.
7.46.3.4.1.2	Even with all of our knowledge of the human brain, and with all of the sophisticated new research tools, we still cannot answer the question &#8220;What is consciousness?&#8221;
7.46.3.4.2.1	The word &#8220;consciousness&#8221; is used in everyday language to refer to being awake in contrast to being asleep or in a coma.
7.46.3.4.2.2	Here we are referring to being mentally aware of yourself, your environment, and events going on around you in such a way that you can plan for future events and make decisions based on experience, evidence, value systems, and predicted consequences.
7.46.3.4.2.3	Speculations about consciousness have been the realm of philosophers, but we are getting closer to a neurobiological understanding.
7.46.3.4.3.1	One requirement for conscious experience is a perception of self that can be integrated with information from the physical and social environment and information from past experience.
7.46.3.4.3.2	The basis for a perception of self derives from the huge amount of somatosensory and visceral information that comes from all parts of the body.
7.46.3.4.3.3	This information is used for motor control and for homeostatic regulation.
7.46.3.4.3.4	It enables animals to find food, seek mates, seek warmth, avoid cold, avoid danger, and so on.
7.46.3.4.3.5	Different types of this afferent information go to appropriate control and regulatory systems in the brainstem and forebrain.
7.46.3.4.3.6	But these diverse sources of information also go to the insular cortex.
7.46.3.4.3.7	The insular lobe appears to integrate physiological information from all over the body to create a sensation of how the body &#8220;feels. &#8221; Thus when an animal&#8217;s actions restore homeostasis, it &#8220;feels&#8221; better, and this is motivation to do the right thing for well-being.
7.46.3.4.4.1	In humans and the great apes, the insular cortex is greatly expanded and its circuitry communicates with parts of the brain involved in planning and decision making.
7.46.3.4.4.2	In imaging studies, the insular lobe is activated by a great diversity of situations that involve strong feelings such as pleasure, disgust, humor, pain, lust, craving, humiliation, guilt, or empathy.
7.46.3.4.4.3	Damage to the insular lobe causes apathy, loss of the ability to enjoy music, loss of sexual responsiveness, and even loss of the ability to distinguish good food from spoiled food.
7.46.3.4.4.4	Humans and the few other species (great apes, elephants, and some marine mammals) that have an expanded insular lobe are the only species that can recognize themselves in a mirror.
7.46.3.4.4.5	Could it be that this very discrete part of our brains and its circuitry are the neurobiological basis for self-awareness?
7.46.3.4.5.1	46.3 recap
7.46.3.4.6.1	Complex functions of the nervous system can be understood in terms of the properties of neurons and neural networks.
7.46.3.4.6.2	Language functions are lateralized to the left cerebral hemisphere.
7.46.3.4.6.3	So, since information about objects seen in the left visual field is processed in the right visual cortex, cannot be described in words, but they can be drawn.

7.46.3.4.8.1	You should be able to:
7.46.3.4.9.1	Recognize the characteristic EEGs associated with wakefulness, non-REM sleep, and REM sleep, and infer which brain areas are active during these distinct phases of the sleep   wake cycle.

7.46.3.4.18.1	Can recordings of place cells reveal processes of memory consolidation during sleep?
7.46.3.4.19.1	Unfortunately we cannot give a rat an exam to ask what it remembers.
7.46.3.4.19.2	However, we can look in other brain areas for electrophysiological patterns of activity that correlate with the hippocampal place-cell patterns.
7.46.3.4.19.3	Wilson and colleagues described the fast replay of the hippocampal place-cell patterns as a unique EEG signal called &#8220;ripples. &#8221; They observed that these ripples were tightly coupled to slower EEG brainwaves that spread to cortical areas of the brain.
7.46.3.4.19.4	When they recorded in some of those other areas   the frontal cortex and the visual cortex   they found similar patterns of firing (i. e. , ripples) in those areas that were synchronized to the hippocampal ripples.
7.46.3.4.19.5	They hypothesized that the ripples represent memory transcripts that are transferred to and stored in areas of the cortex.
7.46.3.4.20.1	Future directions
7.46.3.4.21.1	The neurophysiological studies of the acquisition and consolidation of declarative memories bring us closer to understanding the physical nature of a memory.
7.46.3.4.21.2	The synaptic strengthening known as LTP (long-term potentiation) lasts a long time in contrast to action potentials, but not nearly as long as a memory that can virtually last a lifetime.
7.46.3.4.21.3	We can think of a memory as a piece of information that is stored in the brain.
7.46.3.4.21.4	We have used the word &#8220;information&#8221; a lot in this chapter, but we really do not know what &#8220;information&#8221; is in the brain.
7.46.3.4.21.5	It is not simply action potentials; they are brief, transient events.
7.46.3.4.21.6	It is not patterns of synapses; they are constantly being altered.
7.46.3.4.21.7	It must involve patterns of connectivity in and between neural networks in the brain; but what maintains those networks over years?
7.46.3.4.21.8	We have much to learn about how our brains work.

7.46.summary.28.3	And what about cognitive abilities   functions such as memory and alertness?
7.46.summary.28.4	Looking for answers, researchers ran tests on three groups of subjects.
7.46.summary.28.5	In the first group, subjects were rested and wakeful.
7.46.summary.28.6	This &#8220;RW&#8221; group was compared with subjects who were sleep-deprived for 24 hours (&#8220;SD24&#8221;) and subjects who were sleep-deprived for 35 hours (&#8220;SD35&#8221;).
7.46.summary.28.7	The researchers looked at both alertness and working memory (the ability to hold new information in memory for a short time to enable cognitive processing).
7.46.summary.28.8	They also performed brain scans, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to see what specific areas of the brain were affected by sleep deprivation.
7.46.summary.29.1	In one test (referred to as the LTR test), subjects looked at a picture of four capital letters for 0.5 seconds.
7.46.summary.29.2	Three seconds later they were shown a lowercase letter for 1.5 seconds and were to press a button if the lowercase letter matched one of the capital letters they had just seen.
7.46.summary.30.1	The second test (referred to as the PLUS test) required more cognitive processing than the LTR test.
7.46.summary.30.2	In the PLUS test, subjects looked at a picture of two capital letters for 0.5 seconds.
7.46.summary.30.3	Three seconds later they were shown a lowercase letter for 1.5 seconds and were to press a button if this was the next letter, in alphabetical sequence, after either of the two capital letters.
7.46.summary.31.1	The effect of sleep deprivation on working memory was measured by the accuracy of responses of sleep-deprived (SD) subjects compared with rested and wakeful (RW) subjects.
7.46.summary.31.2	The alertness of the SD and RW subjects was measured by their reaction times in milliseconds.

7.47.7.1	Champion Jumpers
7.47.8.1	The women&#8217;s long jump Olympic record is 7.4 meters, set in 1988 by Jackie Joyner-Kersee.
7.47.8.2	Another world-record long jump was set two years earlier by Rosie the Ribeter, who jumped 6.5 meters.
7.47.8.3	Rosie was a frog competing in the Calaveras County Jumping Frog Contest.
7.47.8.4	Rosie&#8217;s jump is actually more impressive   it was 20 times her body length, whereas Jackie&#8217;s was 5 times her body length.
7.47.8.5	And Rosie jumped from a sitting, crouched position, while Jackie&#8217;s jump was propelled by a sprint.
7.47.9.1	Both jumps were powered by skeletal muscle.
7.47.9.2	The cellular mechanisms of muscle contraction are the same in the frog and the human, so why is the frog&#8217;s jump more impressive?
7.47.9.3	The answer involves the concept of leverage, which depends on the muscles and skeletal elements working together.
7.47.9.4	Muscles pull on bones that are connected at joints to make levers.
7.47.9.5	With a lever you can use the same force to move a large mass a small distance or a small mass a large distance.
7.47.9.6	The ratio of leg length to body mass is greater for the frog than for the human.
7.47.9.7	Thus the frog&#8217;s long legs can move its small body mass a long distance.
7.47.10.1	The power for the frog&#8217;s jump comes from a single contraction of its leg muscles (there is no sprint), and those muscles contract only a very short distance compared to the length of the jump.
7.47.10.2	One species of frog, Rana pipiens, has a body length of only 11 centimeters.
7.47.10.3	It has much longer legs, but muscles that power its jump are only about 3.5 centimeters long and shorten by just 0.75 centimeters (21%) when the frog jumps.
7.47.10.4	Once again leverage comes into play.
7.47.10.5	The thigh muscles are attached to the lower leg bones close to the knee joint, thus they can move the opposite ends of those bones over a longer distance and more quickly than if they were attached farther away from the joint.
7.47.10.6	There is a trade-off, however, in terms of force and speed.
7.47.10.7	To use a shovel, you have one hand near the end of the shaft and the other hand farther down the shaft.
7.47.10.8	With hands close together, you can move the shovel blade fast, but not pick up a heavy load of dirt.
7.47.10.9	With hands farther apart, you can&#8217;t move the blade as fast, but you can pick up a heavier load.
7.47.11.1	What adaptations optimize the jumping muscles of the frog?
7.47.12.1	Chapter 47 continues with
7.47.13.1	47.1 Interactions of Actin and Myosin Cause Muscles to Contract
7.47.1.1.1	Sliding filaments of actin and myosin cause skeletal muscle to contract
7.47.1.2.1	Actin   myosin interactions cause filaments to slide
7.47.1.3.1	Actin   myosin interactions are controlled by calcium ions
7.47.1.4.1	Cardiac muscle is similar to and different from skeletal muscle
7.47.1.5.1	Smooth muscle causes slow contractions of many internal organs
7.47.1.6.1	Most behavior and many physiological actions of animals, such as beating of the heart and moving of food through the digestive tract, depend on muscle contraction.
7.47.1.6.2	Wherever tissues contract, muscle cells are responsible.
7.47.1.6.3	As introduced in Key Concept 39.1 and shown in Figure 39.2, there are three types of vertebrate muscle:
7.47.1.7.1	Skeletal muscle is responsible for all voluntary movements, such as running or playing a piano.
7.47.1.7.2	It is also involved in many involuntary actions, including breathing, shivering, and maintaining posture.
7.47.1.8.1	Cardiac muscle is responsible for the beating of the heart.
7.47.1.9.1	Smooth muscle creates movement in many hollow internal organs, such as the digestive system, bladder, and blood vessels, and is under the control of the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system.
7.47.1.10.1	focus your learning
7.47.1.11.1	When skeletal muscle contracts, the sarcomeres shorten and the band pattern changes.
7.47.1.12.1	Muscle contraction is due to repeated cross bridge forming, breaking, and reforming between the actin and myosin filaments causing them to slide past each other.
7.47.1.13.1	Action potentials arriving at a neuromuscular junction trigger action potentials in the muscle cell membrane, resulting in release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
7.47.1.14.1	Cardiac muscle has similarities and differences with skeletal muscle that are important for their respective functions.
7.47.1.15.1	Skeletal and smooth muscle occur in all animal phyla, but cardiac muscle is unique to vertebrates.
7.47.1.15.2	All three muscle types share the same underlying molecular mechanisms for generating force.
7.47.1.15.3	We will use vertebrate skeletal muscle as our primary example.
7.47.1.15.4	Later in this section we will discuss the differences in cardiac and smooth muscle that adapt them to their particular functions, and at the end of Key Concept 47.2 we will describe some interesting specializations of insect muscle.
7.47.1.1.1.1	Skeletal muscle is also called striated muscle   striated because of its striped appearance (Figure 47.1; also see Figure 39.2) and skeletal because its attachments to skeletal elements make most movements of the body possible.
7.47.1.1.1.2	Skeletal muscle cells, called muscle fibers, are large and long and have many nuclei.
7.47.1.1.1.3	These multinucleate cells form in development through the fusion of many individual embryonic muscle cells called myoblasts.
7.47.1.1.1.4	A specific muscle such as your biceps (which bends your arm) is composed of hundreds or thousands of muscle fibers bundled together by connective tissue.
7.47.1.1.1.5	Figure 47.1 The Structure of Skeletal Muscle
7.47.1.1.2.1	Muscle contraction is due to the interaction between the contractile proteins actin and myosin.
7.47.1.1.2.2	Within muscle cells, *actin and myosin molecules are organized into filaments.
7.47.1.1.2.3	Actin filaments are also called thin filaments, and myosin filaments are called thick filaments.
7.47.1.1.2.4	The two kinds of filaments lie parallel to each other.
7.47.1.1.2.5	When muscle contraction is triggered, the actin and myosin filaments slide past each other in a telescoping fashion.
7.47.1.1.3.1	*connect the concepts Key Concept 5.3 discussed how microfilaments made of polymerized actin are elements of the cytoskeleton that are involved in maintaining cell shape and cell movements in all eukaryotic cells.
7.47.1.1.4.1	What is the relationship between a skeletal muscle fiber and the actin and myosin filaments responsible for its contraction?
7.47.1.1.4.2	Each muscle fiber (cell) is packed with myofibrils   bundles of thin actin and thick myosin filaments arranged in orderly fashion.
7.47.1.1.4.3	In most regions of the myofibril, each thick myosin filament is surrounded by six thin actin filaments, and each thin actin filament sits within a triangle of three thick myosin filaments.
7.47.1.1.5.1	A longitudinal view of a myofibril reveals why skeletal muscle appears striated.
7.47.1.1.5.2	The myofibril consists of repeating units called sarcomeres.
7.47.1.1.5.3	Each sarcomere is made of overlapping filaments of actin and myosin, which create a distinct banding pattern (see Figure 47.1).
7.47.1.1.5.4	Before the molecular nature of the muscle banding pattern was known, the bands were given names that are still used today.
7.47.1.1.5.5	Each sarcomere is bounded by Z lines, which anchor the thin actin filaments.
7.47.1.1.5.6	Centered in the sarcomere is the A band, which contains all the myosin filaments.
7.47.1.1.5.7	The H zone and the I band, which appear light, are regions where actin and myosin filaments do not overlap in the relaxed muscle.
7.47.1.1.5.8	The dark stripe within the H zone is called the M band; it contains proteins that hold the myosin filaments in their regular arrangement.
7.47.1.1.6.1	The bundles of myosin filaments are held in a centered position within the sarcomere by a protein called titin (see Figure 47.2).
7.47.1.1.6.2	Titin is the largest protein in the body; it runs the full length of the sarcomere from Z line to Z line.
7.47.1.1.6.3	Each titin molecule runs right through a myosin bundle.
7.47.1.1.6.4	Between the ends of the myosin bundles and the Z lines, titin molecules are very stretchable, like bungee cords.
7.47.1.1.6.5	In a relaxed skeletal muscle, resistance to stretch is mostly due to the elasticity of the titin molecules.
7.47.1.1.7.1	Figure 47.2 Sliding Filaments
7.47.1.1.8.1	As the muscle contracts, the sarcomeres shorten and the band pattern changes.
7.47.1.1.8.2	The H zone and the I band become much narrower, and the Z lines move toward the A band as if the actin filaments were sliding into the H zone, the region occupied by the myosin filaments (Figure 47.2).
7.47.1.1.8.3	In the mid-1950s this observation independently led two teams of British biologists to propose the sliding filament model of muscle contraction.
7.47.1.1.9.1	It is not uncommon in science for critical breakthroughs to be made simultaneously in different laboratories, but in this case the coincidences are remarkable.
7.47.1.1.9.2	The leaders of the two teams were named Hugh Huxley and Andrew Huxley   but they were not related.
7.47.1.1.9.3	Andrew Huxley was a faculty member at Cambridge University in the early 1950s, and Hugh Huxley was a graduate student working in a different laboratory.
7.47.1.1.9.4	Both were interested in the structure of muscle and the mechanism of contraction.
7.47.1.1.9.5	Hugh Huxley moved to MIT as a postdoctoral fellow where he worked with Jean Hanson using electron microscopy.
7.47.1.1.9.6	Andrew Huxley, joined by Rolf Niedergerke, used a new form of light microscopy that he and Huxley developed.
7.47.1.1.9.7	The two groups proposed the sliding filament model at the same time, and both papers were published in the same issue of the journal Nature.
7.47.1.2.1.1	To understand the mechanism causing the actin and myosin filaments to slide past each other, we must first examine the structures of actin and myosin (Figure 47.3).
7.47.1.2.1.2	A myosin molecule consists of two long polypeptide chains coiled together, each ending in a large globular head.
7.47.1.2.1.3	A myosin filament is made up of many myosin molecules arranged in parallel, with their heads projecting sideways at each end of the filament like a bunch of golf clubs.
7.47.1.2.2.1	Figure 47.3 Actin and Myosin Filaments Overlap to Form Myofibrils
7.47.1.2.3.1	An actin filament consists of actin monomers polymerized into long chains that look like two strands of beads twisted together.
7.47.1.2.3.2	Twisting around the actin chains is another protein, tropomyosin, and attached to tropomyosin at intervals are molecules of troponin.
7.47.1.2.3.3	We&#8217;ll discuss these two proteins in more detail later in this section.
7.47.1.2.4.1	The myosin heads can bind specific sites on actin, to form cross-bridges between the myosin and the actin filaments.
7.47.1.2.4.2	Moreover, when a myosin head binds to an actin filament, the head&#8217;s conformation changes.
7.47.1.2.4.3	As the head bends, it exerts a tiny force that causes the actin filament to move 5   10 nanometers relative to the myosin filament.
7.47.1.2.4.4	When the myosin heads are bound to actin, they can bind and hydrolyze ATP.
7.47.1.2.4.5	The energy released when this happens changes the conformation of the myosin head, causing it to release the actin and return to its extended position, from which it can bind to actin again.
7.47.1.2.5.1	Together these details explain the cycle of events that cause the actin and myosin filaments to slide past each other and shorten the sarcomere.
7.47.1.2.5.2	They also explain rigor mortis   the stiffening of muscles soon after death.
7.47.1.2.5.3	ATP binding causes myosin to release from actin, so when ATP production stops with death, myosin cannot release and the muscles stay contracted.
7.47.1.2.5.4	Eventually, however, the proteins lose their integrity and the muscles soften.
7.47.1.2.5.5	The timing of these events helps a medical examiner estimate the time of death.
7.47.1.2.6.1	We have been discussing the cycle of contraction in terms of a single myosin head.
7.47.1.2.6.2	Remember that each myosin filament has many myosin heads at both ends and is surrounded by six actin filaments; thus the contraction of the sarcomere involves a great many cycles of interaction between actin and myosin molecules.
7.47.1.2.6.3	That is why when a single myosin head breaks its contact with actin, the actin filaments do not slip backward.
7.47.1.3.1.1	Like neurons, muscle cells are excitable   that is, their cell membranes generate and conduct action potentials.
7.47.1.3.1.2	Action potentials are initiated in skeletal muscle fibers by motor neurons arriving at neuromuscular junctions (see Key Concept 44.3).
7.47.1.3.1.3	The axon terminals of motor neurons are generally highly branched and form synapses with hundreds of muscle fibers (Figure 47.4).
7.47.1.3.1.4	A motor neuron and all of the fibers with which it synapses constitute a motor unit.
7.47.1.3.1.5	The fibers contract simultaneously when the unit&#8217;s motor neuron fires.
7.47.1.3.1.6	One muscle can consist of many motor units.
7.47.1.3.1.7	Thus there are two ways to increase a muscle&#8217;s strength of contraction   increase the firing rate of an individual motor neuron, or recruit more motor neurons.
7.47.1.3.2.1	Figure 47.4 The Neuromuscular Junction Axons branching from a single motor neuron end in terminals that innervate multiple skeletal muscle fibers.
7.47.1.3.3.1	When an action potential arrives at a neuromuscular junction, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is released from the motor neuron terminals, diffuses across the synaptic cleft, binds to receptors in the postsynaptic membrane, and causes ion channels in the motor end plate to open (see Figure 44.11).
7.47.1.3.3.2	Most of the ions that flow through these channels are Na&#43;, and therefore the motor end plate is depolarized.
7.47.1.3.3.3	The depolarization spreads to the surrounding cell membrane of the muscle fiber, which contains voltage-gated sodium channels.
7.47.1.3.3.4	When threshold is reached, the cell membrane fires an action potential that is conducted rapidly to all points on the surface of the muscle fiber.
7.47.1.3.4.1	An action potential in a muscle fiber also travels deep within the cell.
7.47.1.3.4.2	The cell membrane is continuous with a system of T tubules that descend into the muscle fiber cytoplasm (also called the sarcoplasm).
7.47.1.3.4.3	The &#8220;T&#8221; stands for &#8220;transverse. &#8221; The contents of the T tubules are ouside the cell.
7.47.1.3.4.4	The T tubules are like the indentations created in a water-filled balloon by poking your finger into it.
7.47.1.3.4.5	The action potential that spreads over the cell membrane also spreads through this system of T tubules (Figure 47.5).
7.47.1.3.4.6	Figure 47.5 T Tubules Spread Action Potentials into the Fiber
7.47.1.3.5.1	The T tubules come very close to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the muscle cell.
7.47.1.3.5.2	In muscle cells the ER is called the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and it is a closed compartment surrounding every myofibril.
7.47.1.3.5.3	Calcium pumps in the sarcoplasmic reticulum take up Ca2+ from the sarcoplasm.
7.47.1.3.5.4	Therefore when the muscle fiber is at rest, there is a high concentration of Ca2+ in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and a very low concentration of Ca2+ in the sarcoplasm.
7.47.1.3.6.1	Spanning the space between the membranes of the T tubules and the membranes of the sarcoplasmic reticulum are two proteins.
7.47.1.3.6.2	One protein, the dihydropyridine (DHP) receptor, is located in the T tubule membrane; it is voltage-sensitive and changes its conformation in response to an action potential spreading through the T tubule system.
7.47.1.3.6.3	The other protein, the ryanodine receptor, is located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane and is a Ca2+ channel.
7.47.1.3.6.4	These two proteins are physically connected.
7.47.1.3.6.5	When the DHP receptor changes its conformation due to an action potential, it causes Ca2+ to flow through the ryanodine receptor from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to the sarcoplasm.
7.47.1.3.6.6	Ca2+ ions diffusing through the sarcoplasm surrounding the actin and myosin filaments trigger the interaction of actin and myosin and the sliding of the filaments.
7.47.1.3.6.7	How do the Ca2+ ions do this?
7.47.1.3.7.1	An actin filament, as you have seen, is a helical arrangement of actin monomers.
7.47.1.3.7.2	Twisted around the actin filament are two strands of the protein tropomyosin (Focus: Key Figure 47.6; see also Figure 47.3).
7.47.1.3.7.3	At regular intervals, the filament also includes a globular protein, troponin.
7.47.1.3.7.4	The troponin molecule has three subunits: one binds actin, one binds tropomyosin, and one binds Ca2+.
7.47.1.3.8.1	focus: key figure
7.47.1.3.9.1	Figure 47.6 Release of Ca2+ from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Triggers Muscle Contraction
7.47.1.3.10.1	When Ca2+ binds to troponin, it changes the conformation of troponin, exposing myosin-binding sites on the actin.
7.47.1.3.10.2	As long as binding sites and ATP are available, the cycle of actin and myosin interactions continues and the filaments slide past each other.
7.47.1.3.10.3	Note that in the relaxed condition, the myosin heads are energized.
7.47.1.3.11.1	Q: What are three roles played by ATP in skeletal muscle contraction?
7.47.1.3.12.1	When the muscle is at rest, the tropomyosin strands are positioned so that they block the myosin-binding sites on the actin filaments.
7.47.1.3.12.2	When Ca2+ is released into the sarcoplasm, it binds to troponin, changing its conformation.
7.47.1.3.12.3	Because the troponin is bound to the tropomyosin, this conformational change twists the tropomyosin enough to expose the actin   myosin binding sites, and the cycle of making and breaking actin   myosin bonds is initiated.
7.47.1.3.12.4	The filaments pull past each other, and the muscle fiber contracts.
7.47.1.3.12.5	When the calcium pumps in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes remove the Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasm, the conformation of the tropomyosin reverts and again blocks the binding of myosin heads to actin, and the muscle fiber returns to its resting condition.
7.47.1.3.12.6	Figure 47.6 summarizes this cycle.
7.47.1.4.1.1	Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle appears striated because of the regular arrangement of actin and myosin filaments into sarcomeres (Figure 47.7).
7.47.1.4.1.2	The difference between cardiac and skeletal muscle is that cardiac muscle cells are smaller and have only one nucleus each (uninucleate).
7.47.1.4.1.3	Cardiac muscle cells branch, and the branches of adjoining cells interdigitate, forming a meshwork resistant to tearing.
7.47.1.4.1.4	As a result, the heart walls can withstand high pressures while pumping blood, without the danger of developing leaks.
7.47.1.4.1.5	Adding to the strength of cardiac muscle are intercalated discs that provide strong mechanical adhesions between adjacent cells.
7.47.1.4.1.6	Gap junctions are an important feature of cardiac muscle.
7.47.1.4.1.7	These structures in the intercalated discs allow cytoplasmic continuity between cells (see Figure 7.16).
7.47.1.4.1.8	Because of gap junctions, cardiac muscle cells are electrically coupled.
7.47.1.4.1.9	An action potential initiated at one point in a sheet of cardiac muscle spreads rapidly, causing a large number of cardiac muscle cells to contract simultaneously.
7.47.1.4.1.10	Figure 47.7 Cardiac Muscle Cells Form a Strong Meshwork
7.47.1.4.2.1	Certain cardiac muscle cells are specialized for generating and conducting electric signals.
7.47.1.4.2.2	These pacemaker and conducting cells have a low density of actin and myosin filaments, but they initiate and coordinate the rhythmic contractions of the heart.
7.47.1.4.2.3	(The molecular basis for this pacemaking function will be covered in Key Concept 49.3. )
7.47.1.4.2.4	Pacemaker cells make the vertebrate heartbeat autorhythmic, meaning it is generated by the heart muscle itself.
7.47.1.4.2.5	A heart removed from a vertebrate can continue to beat with no input from the nervous system.
7.47.1.4.2.6	Input from the autonomic nervous system modifies the rate of the pacemaker cells, but it is not essential for their continued rhythmic function.
7.47.1.4.3.1	The mechanism of excitation   contraction coupling in cardiac muscle cells is different from that in skeletal muscle cells.
7.47.1.4.3.2	The T tubules are larger, and the DHP receptor proteins in the T tubules are Ca2+ channels.
7.47.1.4.3.3	These T tubule proteins are not physically connected with the ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
7.47.1.4.3.4	Instead, when an action potential spreads down the T tubules, it causes the voltage-gated DHP channels to open, allowing extracellular Ca2+ to flow into the sarcoplasm.
7.47.1.4.3.5	That increased sarcoplasmic Ca2+ binds to the ryanodine receptors and opens the calcium channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
7.47.1.4.3.6	The resulting huge rise in sarcoplasmic Ca2+ concentration stimulates fiber contraction.
7.47.1.4.3.7	This mechanism is called Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release.
7.47.1.5.1.1	Smooth muscle provides the contractile force for most of our internal organs, which are under the control of the autonomic nervous system.
7.47.1.5.1.2	Smooth muscle moves food through the digestive tract, controls the flow of blood through blood vessels, and empties the urinary bladder.
7.47.1.5.1.3	Smooth muscle also generates &#8220;goose bumps&#8221; on the skin and causes the hair on the back of a dog or cat to stand erect when the animal is being aggressive or defensive.
7.47.1.5.1.4	Structurally, smooth muscle cells are the simplest muscle cells.
7.47.1.5.1.5	They are smaller than skeletal muscle cells, usually long and spindle-shaped, and each has a single nucleus.
7.47.1.5.1.6	They are &#8220;smooth&#8221; because the actin and myosin filaments are not as regularly arranged as they are in skeletal and cardiac muscle, and so do not produce the striated appearance.
7.47.1.5.2.1	Some smooth muscle tissue, such as that from the wall of the digestive tract, is arranged in sheets, and individual cells in a sheet are in electrical contact with one another through gap junctions, as they are in cardiac muscle.
7.47.1.5.2.2	As a result, an action potential generated in one smooth muscle cell spreads to all the cells in that sheet of tissue, and the sheet contracts in a coordinated fashion.
7.47.1.5.3.1	The cell membranes of smooth muscle cells are sensitive to stretch, with important consequences.
7.47.1.5.3.2	For example, if the wall of the digestive tract is stretched in one location (as by a mouthful of food passing down the esophagus to the stomach), the membranes of the stretched cells depolarize, reach threshold, and fire action potentials, which cause the cells to contract.
7.47.1.5.3.3	Thus smooth muscle contracts after being stretched, and the harder it is stretched, the stronger it contracts.
7.47.1.5.3.4	This behavior of smooth muscle is important for moving food through the digestive system.
7.47.1.5.4.1	The walls of blood vessels   except capillaries   are smooth muscle.
7.47.1.5.4.2	This is especially true on the arterial side where the blood is under higher pressure.
7.47.1.5.4.3	Changes in vascular smooth muscle tone are responsible for controlling the distribution of blood in the body.
7.47.1.5.5.1	The neural influences on smooth muscle come from the two divisions of the autonomic nervous system (see Figure 46.8).
7.47.1.5.5.2	The neurotransmitters of the sympathetic and parasympathetic postganglionic cells alter the membrane potential of smooth muscle cells.
7.47.1.5.5.3	For example, in the digestive tract, acetylcholine causes smooth muscle cells to depolarize, making them more likely to fire action potentials and contract.
7.47.1.5.5.4	Antagonistically, norepinephrine causes these muscle cells to hyperpolarize and thus be less likely to fire action potentials and contract (Figure 47.8B).
7.47.1.5.5.5	In contrast, norepinephrine acting through G protein-coupled receptors causes the smooth muscle in arteries serving the gut to contract.
7.47.1.5.5.6	Remember that the action of the neurotransmitters depends on the receptors in the target tissues.
7.47.1.5.5.7	Sympathetic activity is high in a fight-or-flight situation; in an emergency you don&#8217;t need to digest your lunch, but it could help to shunt blood to the tissues critical for survival.
7.47.1.5.6.1	Figure 47.8 How do Autonomic Nervous System Neuro-transmitters Control the Firing Rate of Smooth Muscle Cells?
7.47.1.5.6.2	Figure 47.9 The Role of Ca2+ in Smooth Muscle Contraction
7.47.1.5.7.1	Smooth muscle cell contraction is not controlled by the troponin   tropomyosin mechanism, but calcium still plays a critical role.
7.47.1.5.7.2	A Ca2+ influx into the sarcoplasm of a smooth muscle cell can be stimulated by action potentials, hormones, or stretching.
7.47.1.5.7.3	The Ca2+ that enters the sarcoplasm combines with a protein called calmodulin.
7.47.1.5.7.4	The Ca2+   calmodulin complex activates an enzyme called myosin kinase that phosphorylates myosin heads.
7.47.1.5.7.5	When the myosin heads in smooth muscle are phosphorylated, they undergo cycles of binding and releasing actin, causing muscle contraction.
7.47.1.5.7.6	As Ca2+ is removed from the sarcoplasm, it dissociates from calmodulin, and the activity of myosin kinase falls.
7.47.1.5.7.7	An additional enzyme, myosin phosphatase, dephosphorylates the myosin to help reduce actin   myosin interactions (Figure 47.9).
7.47.1.5.8.1	47.1 recap
7.47.1.5.9.1	The three types of muscle are skeletal, cardiac, and smooth.
7.47.1.5.9.2	The contractile ability of muscle derives from interactions between actin and myosin filaments.
7.47.1.5.9.3	Contraction depends on control by Ca2+ in the sarcoplasm.
7.47.1.5.9.4	Tropomyosin and troponin are controlling elements in skeletal and cardiac muscle.
7.47.1.5.9.5	Calmodulin is the controlling element in smooth muscle.

7.47.1.5.21.1	Why are gap junctions important to the function of cardiac and smooth muscle, but not skeletal muscle?
7.47.1.5.22.1	Now that you understand how muscles generate force, let&#8217;s look at what determines the characteristics of a muscle, its performance, and how individual muscles can change their characteristics with regular use and conditioning.
7.47.1.5.23.1	Chapter 47 continues with
7.47.1.5.24.1	47.2 Many Factors Affect Muscle Performance
7.47.2.1.1	The strength of a muscle contraction depends on how many fibers are contracting and at what rate
7.47.2.2.1	Muscle fiber types determine endurance and strength
7.47.2.3.1	A muscle has an optimal length for generating maximum tension
7.47.2.4.1	Exercise increases muscle strength and endurance
7.47.2.5.1	Muscle ATP supply limits performance
7.47.2.6.1	Insect muscle has the greatest rate of cycling
7.47.2.7.1	The functions that different muscles perform place different demands on them.
7.47.2.7.2	Some muscles, such as postural muscles, must sustain a load continuously over long periods of time.
7.47.2.7.3	Muscles used in walking or running must vary their strength of contraction over a wide range of positions.
7.47.2.7.4	In contrast, the jumping muscles of the frog must exert maximum force instantaneously.
7.47.2.7.5	The muscles that control your fingers generally do not have to sustain long, strong contractions, but they must be able to undergo quick yet graded contractions for fine manual dexterity.
7.47.2.7.6	What is &#8220;quick&#8221; for humans, however, doesn&#8217;t begin to compare with insect flight muscles that can contract as fast as 1,000 times per second.
7.47.2.7.7	How are different muscles adapted for specific functions and demands?
7.47.2.8.1	focus your learning
7.47.2.9.1	A twitch is a unit of contraction in one muscle fiber initiated by a single action potential.
7.47.2.10.1	Many twitches can be summed in response to many action potentials to produce a large and/or sustained force.
7.47.2.11.1	Slow- and fast-twitch muscle fiber types differ in the rate at which they develop and maintain tension.
7.47.2.12.1	Three systems supply ATP to muscles for contraction, and together they determine the work capacity and endurance of a muscle.
7.47.2.1.1.1	In skeletal muscle, the arrival of an action potential at a neuromuscular junction causes an action potential in a muscle fiber.
7.47.2.1.1.2	The spread of that action potential through the muscle fiber&#8217;s T tubule system causes a minimum unit of contraction, called a twitch.
7.47.2.1.1.3	A twitch can be measured in terms of the tension, or force, it generates (Figure 47.10A).
7.47.2.1.1.4	A single action potential stimulates a single twitch, but the ultimate force generated by an action potential varies enormously depending on how many muscle fibers it reaches.
7.47.2.1.1.5	The level of tension an entire muscle generates depends on two factors: the number of motor units activated, and the frequency at which the motor units fire.
7.47.2.1.2.1	Figure 47.10 Twitches and Tetanus
7.47.2.1.3.1	In muscles responsible for fine movements, such as those of the fingers, a motor neuron may innervate only one or a few muscle fibers, but in a muscle that produces large forces, such as the biceps, a motor neuron innervates a large number of muscle fibers.
7.47.2.1.4.1	At the level of a muscle fiber, a single action potential stimulates a single twitch.
7.47.2.1.4.2	If action potentials reaching the muscle fiber are adequately separated in time, each twitch is a discrete, all-or-none phenomenon.
7.47.2.1.4.3	If action potentials are fired more rapidly, however, new twitches are triggered before the myofibrils have a chance to return to their resting condition.
7.47.2.1.4.4	As a result, the twitches sum, and the tension generated by the fiber increases and becomes more sustained.
7.47.2.1.4.5	Thus an individual muscle fiber can show a graded response to increased levels of stimulation by its motor neuron.
7.47.2.1.5.1	Twitches sum at high levels of stimulation because the calcium pumps in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (see Figure 47.5) are unable to clear the Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasm between action potentials.
7.47.2.1.5.2	Eventually a stimulation frequency can be reached that results in the continuous presence of Ca2+ in the sarcoplasm at high enough levels to cause continuous activation of the contractile machinery   a condition known as tetanus (Figure 47.10B).
7.47.2.1.5.3	(Do not confuse this condition with the disease tetanus, which is caused by a bacterial toxin and is characterized by spastic contractions of skeletal muscles. )
7.47.2.1.6.1	How long a muscle fiber can maintain a tetanic contraction depends on its supply of ATP.
7.47.2.1.6.2	Eventually the contracting fiber will become fatigued and be unable to sustain the contraction.
7.47.2.1.6.3	It may seem paradoxical that the lack of ATP causes fatigue, since the action of ATP is to break actin   myosin bonds.
7.47.2.1.6.4	But remember that the energy released from the hydrolysis of ATP &#8220;re-cocks&#8221; the myosin heads, allowing them to cycle through another power stroke.
7.47.2.1.6.5	When a muscle is contracting against a load, the cycle of making and breaking actin   myosin bonds must continue in order to prevent the load from stretching the muscle.
7.47.2.1.6.6	The situation is like rowing a boat upstream.
7.47.2.1.6.7	You cannot maintain your position relative to the stream bank by just holding the oars out against the current; you have to keep rowing.
7.47.2.1.6.8	Likewise, actin   myosin bonds have to keep cycling to maintain tension in the muscle.
7.47.2.1.7.1	Many muscles of the body maintain a low level of tension even when the body is at rest.
7.47.2.1.7.2	For example, the muscles of the neck, trunk, and limbs that maintain our posture against the pull of gravity are always working, even when we are standing or sitting still.
7.47.2.1.7.3	Muscle tone comes from the activity of a small but changing number of motor units in a muscle; at any one time, some of the muscle&#8217;s fibers are contracting and others are relaxed.
7.47.2.1.7.4	The nervous system is constantly readjusting muscle tone.
7.47.2.2.1.1	Not all skeletal muscle fibers are alike, and a single muscle often contains more than one type of fiber.
7.47.2.2.1.2	The two major types of skeletal muscle fibers express different genes for their myosin molecules, and these myosin variants have different rates of ATPase activity.
7.47.2.2.1.3	Those with high ATPase activity can recycle their actin   myosin cross-bridges rapidly and are therefore called fast-twitch fibers; those with lower ATPase activity are called slow-twitch fibers, and they develop tension more slowly but can maintain it longer (Figure 47.11A).
7.47.2.2.1.4	Figure 47.11 Fast- and Slow-Twitch Muscle Fibers
7.47.2.2.2.1	Slow-twitch fibers are also called oxidative or red muscle because they contain especially large amounts of myoglobin (an oxygen-binding protein similar to the hemoglobin in red blood cells), have many mitochondria, and are well supplied with blood vessels.
7.47.2.2.2.2	These characteristics increase the fibers&#8217; capacity for oxidative metabolism and result in their red appearance.
7.47.2.2.2.3	The maximum tension a slow-twitch fiber produces is low and develops slowly but is highly resistant to fatigue.
7.47.2.2.2.4	Slow-twitch fibers have substantial reserves of fuel, mostly lipids, so they can maintain steady, prolonged production of ATP as long as oxygen is available.
7.47.2.2.2.5	Muscles with high proportions of slow-twitch fibers are good for long-term aerobic work (that is, work that requires oxygen).
7.47.2.2.2.6	Long-distance runners, swimmers, cyclists, and other athletes whose activities require endurance have leg and arm muscles consisting mostly of slow-twitch fibers (Figure 47.11B).
7.47.2.2.3.1	Fast-twitch fibers, also called glycolytic or white muscle, have few mitochondria, little or no myoglobin, and fewer blood vessels; thus they look pale.
7.47.2.2.3.2	Their major energy source is glycolysis, and therefore their major stored fuel is glycogen.
7.47.2.2.3.3	Fast-twitch glycolytic fibers can develop maximum tension more rapidly than slow-twitch fibers can, and that maximum tension is greater.
7.47.2.2.3.4	However, fast-twitch fibers fatigue rapidly (see Figure 47.11A).
7.47.2.2.3.5	The myosin of these fibers puts the energy of ATP to work very rapidly, but the fibers cannot replenish ATP quickly enough to sustain contraction for a long time.
7.47.2.2.3.6	Fast-twitch fibers are especially good for short-term work that requires maximum strength, such as sprinting (see Figure 47.11B).
7.47.2.2.4.1	The types of fibers that make up a muscle influence the performance properties of that muscle, and different muscles have different fiber compositions depending on their function.
7.47.2.2.4.2	Postural muscles that maintain continuous contractions are mostly composed of slow-twitch fibers.
7.47.2.2.4.3	An example is the soleus muscle that runs up the back of the leg from the heel.
7.47.2.2.4.4	Its contraction extends the foot and is therefore used in walking, but its continuous contraction is required for standing.
7.47.2.2.4.5	If the soleus muscle fatigued, we would fall forward.
7.47.2.2.4.6	We can walk or stand for a long period of time because the soleus muscle is resistant to fatigue.
7.47.2.2.4.7	In contrast, a muscle that is used mostly for short-term work, such as the biceps, has a higher percentage of fast-twitch fibers than does the soleus.
7.47.2.2.4.8	We can use our biceps to pick up a heavy weight, but we cannot hold that weight in a given position for a long period of time.
7.47.2.2.5.1	Can you change the fiber composition of your muscles to optimize your performance in a particular activity?
7.47.2.2.5.2	To a limited extent, you can alter the properties of your muscle fibers through training.
7.47.2.2.5.3	There are fast-twitch fibers that are somewhat oxidative and therefore intermediate in their properties between slow-twitch and fast-twitch fibers.
7.47.2.2.5.4	These intermediate fibers can become more oxidative with endurance training and more glycolytic with strength training.
7.47.2.2.5.5	However, the most important determinant of your muscle fiber types is your genetic heritage.
7.47.2.2.5.6	There is some truth to the statement that champions are born, not made.
7.47.2.2.5.7	A person born with a high proportion of fast-twitch fibers in her legs is unlikely to become a champion marathon runner, and a person born with a high proportion of slow-twitch fibers in her legs is unlikely to become a champion sprinter.
7.47.2.3.1.1	Two parts of a pull-up exercise are especially difficult.
7.47.2.3.1.2	When your arms are fully extended, it is hard to start the pull-up; and when your chin has almost reached the bar, the last little bit is difficult.
7.47.2.3.1.3	The structure of the sarcomere is the reason.
7.47.2.3.1.4	Figure 47.12 Force and Length
7.47.2.3.2.1	When a muscle changes length the sarcomeres also change length, and the spatial relationships between the actin and myosin filaments changes (Figure 47.12).
7.47.2.3.2.2	If there is no actin   myosin overlap, cross-bridges cannot form and the sarcomere can&apos;t generate force.
7.47.2.3.2.3	This is almost the situation when you are hanging from the pull-up bar.
7.47.2.3.2.4	At the other extreme, when the muscle is fully contracted, the actin filaments are overlapping and the myosin filaments are bumping up against the Z lines, so additional force cannot be generated.
7.47.2.3.2.5	With these considerations, you can ask how well a specific muscle   such as the frog jumping muscle   will function given a range of sarcomere lengths.
7.47.2.3.2.6	In Investigating Life: What Is the Optimal Resting Position for the Jumping Muscle of the Frog?, we examine experiments done to identify the optimal sarcomere length for a forceful frog jump.
7.47.2.3.2.7	As you review these experiments, think about how they apply to deciding on the best starting position for a sprint.

7.47.2.3.6.3	Science 263: 370   372.
7.47.2.3.7.1	The force propelling a frog&#8217;s jump should be greatest when there is optimal overlap between the actin and myosin filaments and not when the muscle is stretched.
7.47.2.3.7.2	The following experiment attempted to determine the resting sarcomere length that allows a frog to achieve a maximal jump.
7.47.2.3.8.1	QUESTIONSIf you want to get the maximum force out of a slingshot, you stretch it as far as you can.
7.47.2.3.8.2	Would the frog&#8217;s jump be greater if the jumping muscle were stretched when the frog was crouched before the jump?
7.47.2.3.9.1	METHOD
7.47.2.3.10.1	Through anatomical studies measure sarcomere length at different resting positions observed in frogs before they jump and also measure the changes in muscle length and sarcomere length during jumps.
7.47.2.3.11.1	Excise frog jumping muscle from a frog and mount it in a tissue culture chamber so that the muscle can be held at different lengths and electrically stimulated to contract.
7.47.2.3.11.2	Attach one end of the muscle to a force transducer that measures the force generated by the contraction.
7.47.2.3.11.3	With this experimental set-up you can determine the relationship between sarcomere length and maximum force the muscle can generate.
7.47.2.3.12.1	Compare the sarcomere length measurements with the forces measured in muscles held at different lengths.
7.47.2.3.13.1	Measure velocity of contraction of the muscle under different load conditions.
7.47.2.3.14.1	RESULTS
7.47.2.3.15.1	With methods not described here, it was determined that the jumping muscle shortened from 33.6 mm to 26.1 mm during a jump, and the resting sarcomere lengths varied from 2.34   m to 1.82   m.
7.47.2.3.16.1	The relative forces generated by isometric contraction at different sarcomere lengths corresponded well with a previously determined strength-length curve (data points shown in the graph).
7.47.2.3.17.1	CONCLUSION During the jump, the sarcomeres of the frog shortened over the optimal range for generation of force.
7.47.2.3.18.1	work with the data
7.47.2.3.19.1	The resting position of the sarcomeres and the extent of their shortening during a jump maximize the force that the frog&#8217;s muscle can generate to power the jump.
7.47.2.3.19.2	But in physical terms, power is a force applied over a specific time.
7.47.2.3.19.3	Therefore the velocity of contraction (measured as muscle length/second [ML/s]) will influence the maximum power the muscle can generate, and the velocity of contraction depends on the load.
7.47.2.3.19.4	If the load is too great, the contraction is isometric (velocity = 0).
7.47.2.3.19.5	If the load is negligible, the velocity of contraction can be maximal.
7.47.2.3.19.6	Figure A shows the relationship between force and velocity of contraction in a frog jumping muscle under different loads.
7.47.2.3.19.7	The mean jump velocity is indicated.
7.47.2.3.19.8	Figure B shows the change in muscle length (mm) during a jump (milliseconds).

7.47.2.3.21.1	QUESTIONS
7.47.2.3.22.1	Power is work/time and work is force &#215; displacement.
7.47.2.3.22.2	Displacement/time = velocity.
7.47.2.3.22.3	Therefore power = force &#215; velocity.
7.47.2.3.22.4	Using the data in Figure A, plot a curve that shows power as a function of contraction velocity for the frog muscle.
7.47.2.3.23.1	What is the velocity of contraction of the frog jumping muscle in muscle lengths/sec?
7.47.2.3.23.2	Use the data in Figure B.
7.47.2.3.24.1	Is the speed and force of the frog muscle optimal for generating the most powerful jump?
7.47.2.3.25.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.47.2.4.1.1	Different types of exercise produce different physical conditioning responses.
7.47.2.4.1.2	In general, anaerobic activities such as weight lifting, increase strength, and aerobic activities such as jogging, increase endurance.
7.47.2.4.1.3	Strength is the maximum force a muscle can exert, and endurance is work capacity or how long a given workload can be sustained.
7.47.2.4.1.4	What are the physiological bases for these differences?
7.47.2.4.2.1	Strength is a function of the volume of the muscles: the more actin and myosin filaments in a muscle fiber, and the more muscle fibers in a muscle, the more tension it can produce.
7.47.2.4.2.2	When athletes undertake strength training, they use weights or exercises such as pull-ups to repeatedly contract specific muscles under heavy loads.
7.47.2.4.2.3	Repetitions are usually done until the muscle is completely fatigued.
7.47.2.4.2.4	Such stress on a muscle does minor tissue damage   hence the soreness the day or two after a hard workout   but it also induces the formation of new actin and myosin filaments in existing muscle fibers.
7.47.2.4.2.5	The muscle fibers, and hence the muscles, get bigger and stronger.
7.47.2.4.2.6	In extreme cases, and after serious muscle damage, new muscle fibers can also be produced from stem cells called satellite cells in the muscle.
7.47.2.4.2.7	In general, however, the major effect of strength training is to produce bigger, rather than more, muscle fibers.
7.47.2.4.3.1	Aerobic exercise has a completely different effect on muscles: it enhances their oxidative capacity.
7.47.2.4.3.2	This effect comes from increases in the number of mitochondria, in enzymes involved in energy use, and in the density of capillaries that deliver oxygen to the muscle.
7.47.2.4.3.3	Myoglobin also increases in skeletal muscle cells.
7.47.2.4.3.4	Myoglobin is similar to hemoglobin, but it has a higher affinity for oxygen.
7.47.2.4.3.5	Therefore myoglobin accepts oxygen from the blood, facilitates the diffusion of oxygen throughout the muscle, and provides a store of oxygen for use when oxygen delivery by the blood is insufficient.
7.47.2.4.3.6	By increasing the capacity of muscle to use oxygen to produce ATP, aerobic training increases the length of time that a given workload can be sustained.
7.47.2.5.1.1	Muscles have three systems for supplying the ATP they need for contraction:
7.47.2.5.2.1	The immediate system uses preformed ATP and creatine phosphate.
7.47.2.5.3.1	The glycolytic system metabolizes carbohydrates to lactate and pyruvate.
7.47.2.5.4.1	The oxidative system metabolizes carbohydrates or fats all the way to H2O and CO2.
7.47.2.5.5.1	The capacity of these three systems and the rates at which they can produce ATP determine both work capacity and endurance of a muscle (Figure 47.13).
7.47.2.5.5.2	Figure 47.13 Supplying Fuel for High Performance
7.47.2.5.6.1	ATP is present in muscles in very small amounts.
7.47.2.5.6.2	However, muscle fibers also contain a storage compound called creatine phosphate (CP).
7.47.2.5.6.3	This molecule stores energy in a phosphate bond that it can transfer to ADP.
7.47.2.5.6.4	The total energy available in all the muscles of your body in the form of ATP and CP   the immediate energy system   is only about 10 kilocalories.
7.47.2.5.6.5	When at rest, you metabolize a kilocalorie of energy in less than a minute.
7.47.2.5.6.6	Even though the energy available from ATP and CP is limited, it is available immediately, and it enables fast-twitch fibers to generate a lot of force quickly.
7.47.2.5.6.7	During burst activity, the immediate system is exhausted in seconds.
7.47.2.5.7.1	The glycolytic system activates within a few seconds to replace the ATP depleted at the onset of muscle activity.
7.47.2.5.7.2	The glycolytic enzymes are located in the cytoplasm of the muscle fiber, and therefore the ATP they generate is rapidly available to the myosin filaments.
7.47.2.5.7.3	However, as noted in Chapter 9, glycolysis alone is an inefficient way to produce ATP, and it leads to the accumulation of lactic acid, which slows the process.
7.47.2.5.7.4	Thus the glycolytic system and the immediate system together provide the energy needed by active muscles for less than a minute (see Figure 47.13).
7.47.2.5.7.5	Fortunately, oxidative metabolism becomes fully active in about a minute, producing relatively huge amounts of ATP because it can completely metabolize carbohydrates and fats to CO2 and water.
7.47.2.5.7.6	However, it requires many reactions, and it takes place in the mitochondria, so O2 and substrate must get into the mitochondria, and the formed ATP must get from the mitochondria to the myosin filaments in the muscle.
7.47.2.5.7.7	These processes are not instantaneous, so the rate at which oxidative metabolism can make ATP available to do work is slower than the rate at which the other two systems can supply ATP.
7.47.2.5.8.1	The *fuel resources available to the muscles influences how long someone can sustain a high level of aerobic exercise.
7.47.2.5.8.2	From the circulating blood, muscle receives glucose and free fatty acids that it metabolizes to generate ATP.
7.47.2.5.8.3	At high levels of aerobic exercise, however, most of the fuel used by muscles to produce ATP comes from the reserve of glycogen stored in the muscle itself.
7.47.2.5.8.4	Depletion of muscle glycogen contributes to fatigue.
7.47.2.5.9.1	*connect the concepts The work performance curves for different activities reflect the complexity of the biochemical processes by which different fuel sources are metabolized to product ATP.
7.47.2.5.9.2	Glycolysis supports anaerobic activities and it only entails ten enzymatic steps, so it can come on fast (see Key Concept 9.2).
7.47.2.5.9.3	For aerobic activity the citric acid cycle and the respiratory chain reactions add more steps and limit the rate of ATP production.

7.47.2.5.11.1	Does Heat Cause Muscle Fatigue?
7.47.2.5.12.1	Original Paper: Grahn, D. A., V. H. Cao, C. M. Nguyen, M. T. Lieu and H. C. Heller. 2012.
7.47.2.5.12.2	Work volume and strength training responses to resistive exercise improve with periodic heat extraction from the palm.
7.47.2.5.12.3	Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research 26: 2558   2569.
7.47.2.5.13.1	Physical conditioning requires repeated intense physical activity, and the capacity of such workouts is limited by muscle fatigue.
7.47.2.5.13.2	Because metabolic heat production raises the temperature of muscles during workouts, it is possible that the rise in temperature contributes to muscle fatigue and limits the capacity of workouts.
7.47.2.5.13.3	To test this idea, investigators used rapid-cooling technology to extract heat from subjects during 3-minute rests between ten sets of pull-ups twice a week.
7.47.2.5.13.4	In each of the ten sets of pull-ups, the subject worked until muscle failure   the inability to complete an additional pull-up.
7.47.2.5.13.5	The control condition was 3-minute rests without cooling.
7.47.2.5.13.6	Each subject was his own control; the subjects were randomly assigned to begin with 6 weeks of training with cooling or 6 weeks of training without cooling, followed by a reversal of the treatments.
7.47.2.5.13.7	The results are shown in the figure.

7.47.2.5.19.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.47.2.5.20.1	The rate at which muscle glycogen is replenished depends on diet.
7.47.2.5.20.2	Glycogen is quickly replenished with a high-carbohydrate diet, but slowly replenished with a high-fat diet.
7.47.2.5.20.3	A method used to maximize muscle glycogen is called carbo-loading.
7.47.2.5.20.4	About 1 week before an athletic event, athletes typically exercise for 3   5 days at a level that depletes muscle glycogen.
7.47.2.5.20.5	Then, 2   3 days before the event, they taper down their level of training and eat a diet rich in complex carbohydrates.
7.47.2.5.20.6	The result can be glycogen supercompensation, in which the restoration of muscle glycogen stores &#8220;overshoots&#8221; and reaches above-normal levels.
7.47.2.6.1.1	Insect flight muscle can produce a wingbeat frequency of up to 1,000 cycles per second.
7.47.2.6.1.2	Since neuronal action potentials last 1   3 milliseconds, that number of cycles per second would exceed the capacity of motor neurons, let alone the mechanism of cycling of striated muscle contraction/relaxation.
7.47.2.6.1.3	The extremely fast wingbeat of a hummingbird may be only about 50 cycles per second.
7.47.2.6.1.4	How do insects do it?
7.47.2.6.2.1	Vertebrate skeletal muscle and much of invertebrate skeletal muscle is called &#8220;synchronous&#8221; because the cycling of the contractile mechanism is linked to the firing of the motor neurons.
7.47.2.6.2.2	Insect flight muscle does not contract in tandem with the firing of motor neurons, however, and is thus called &#8220;asynchronous&#8221; muscle.
7.47.2.6.2.3	The firing of action potentials in the insect flight motor neurons is not particularly fast, but it does cause depolarization of the muscle cell membrane, the spreading of an action potential throughout the membrane, and the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
7.47.2.6.2.4	However, once the asynchronous muscle fiber is stimulated, its cycle of contraction/relaxation proceeds at its own characteristic frequency as long as Ca2+ is available to bind to the troponin.
7.47.2.6.2.5	Thus contractile cycling and the resulting wingbeat frequency are not tied to the firing rate of the flight motor neurons.
7.47.2.6.3.1	47.2 recap
7.47.2.6.4.1	Depending on the function a muscle serves, it may need to generate maximum force rapidly, sustain activity for a long period, or contract and relax at a very rapid rate.
7.47.2.6.4.2	Properties of muscles can facilitate these types of activities.
7.47.2.6.5.1	learning outcomes
7.47.2.6.6.1	You should be able to:
7.47.2.6.7.1	Explain the factors that determine how much force or tension is generated by a muscle.
7.47.2.6.8.1	Apply knowledge about muscle fiber types to explain how they contribute to performance abilities in aerobic versus anaerobic work.
7.47.2.6.9.1	In terms of the relationships between motor neurons and skeletal muscles, how can the nervous system control the amount of force generated by a muscle?
7.47.2.6.10.1	Why do postural muscles have a higher percentage of slow-twitch fibers than do muscles used for sprinting?
7.47.2.6.11.1	Apply knowledge about the three systems used by muscles as sources of ATP to explain observations about human physical performance.
7.47.2.6.12.1	Regardless of how much force a muscle can generate, how long it can sustain a workload, or how fast it can contract and relax, a muscle needs something to pull on; otherwise it would just be a lump of pulsating, quivering tissue.
7.47.2.6.12.2	Let&#8217;s look now at how muscle and skeletal elements work together to produce movement.
7.47.2.6.13.1	Chapter 47 continues with
7.47.2.6.14.1	47.3 Muscles and Skeletal Systems Work Together
7.47.3.1.1	A hydrostatic skeleton consists of fluid in a muscular cavity
7.47.3.2.1	Exoskeletons are rigid outer structures
7.47.3.3.1	Vertebrate endoskeletons consist of cartilage and bone
7.47.3.4.1	Bones develop from connective tissues
7.47.3.5.1	Bones that have a common joint can work as a lever
7.47.3.6.1	Muscles can contract and exert force, or they can relax.
7.47.3.6.2	To create significant movement, they must have something to pull on and something that stretches the muscle back to a longer position.
7.47.3.6.3	In some cases muscles pull on each other, as in the trunk of an elephant or the arms of an octopus.
7.47.3.6.4	In most cases, however, skeletal systems are the rigid supports against which muscles pull to create directed movement.
7.47.3.6.5	In this section we will examine the three types of skeletal systems: hydrostatic skeletons, exoskeletons, and endoskeletons.
7.47.3.7.1	focus your learning
7.47.3.8.1	Three types of skeletons have evolved in animals, and each provides resistance against forces exerted by muscles to enable locomotion.
7.47.3.9.1	Three cell types, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes are responsible for the development and continuous remodeling of bones of vertebrates.
7.47.3.10.1	Bones and muscles act together across joints to form levers that produce specific types of motion.
7.47.3.1.1.1	Cnidarians, annelids, and other soft-bodied invertebrates have hydrostatic skeletons consisting of a volume of fluid enclosed in a body cavity surrounded by muscle (see Key Concept 30.2).
7.47.3.1.1.2	When muscles oriented in one direction contract, the fluid-filled body cavity bulges out in a perpendicular direction.
7.47.3.1.1.3	Figure 47.14 A Hydrostatic Skeleton
7.47.3.1.2.1	An earthworm uses its hydrostatic skeleton to crawl (Figure 47.14).
7.47.3.1.2.2	The earthworm&#8217;s body cavity is divided into many separate segments filled with extracellular fluid.
7.47.3.1.2.3	The body wall surrounding each segment has two muscle layers: a circular layer and a longitudinal layer.
7.47.3.1.2.4	If the circular muscles in a segment contract, that segment constricts and elongates.
7.47.3.1.2.5	If the longitudinal muscles in a segment contract, it shortens and bulges outward.
7.47.3.1.2.6	Alternating contractions of the earthworm&#8217;s circular and longitudinal muscles create waves of narrowing and widening, lengthening and shortening, that travel down the body.
7.47.3.1.2.7	Bulging, shortened segments serve as anchors as long, narrow segments project forward and longitudinal contractions pull other segments forward.
7.47.3.1.2.8	Bristles help the widest parts of the body to hold firm against the substrate, so the body moves forward.
7.47.3.2.1.1	An exoskeleton is a hardened, rigid outer surface to which muscles can be attached.
7.47.3.2.1.2	Contractions of the muscles cause jointed segments of the exoskeleton to move relative to each other.
7.47.3.2.1.3	The simplest example of an exoskeleton is the shell of a mollusk.
7.47.3.2.1.4	Some marine mollusks, such as clams, have shells composed of protein strengthened by crystals of calcium carbonate (a rock-hard material).
7.47.3.2.1.5	These shells can be massive, affording significant protection against predators.
7.47.3.2.1.6	Some terrestrial mollusks (and snails) generally lack the hard mineral component and are much lighter.
7.47.3.2.2.1	The most complex exoskeletons are found among the arthropods (see Key Concept 31.1).
7.47.3.2.2.2	A type of exoskeleton called a cuticle covers the outer surfaces of the arthropod body including its appendages.
7.47.3.2.2.3	It is made up of chitin (a nitrogen-containing polysaccharide) secreted by a layer of cells just below the exoskeleton.
7.47.3.2.2.4	Chitin stiffens and hardens the cuticle everywhere except at the joints, where flexibility must be retained.
7.47.3.2.2.5	Muscles attached to the inner surfaces of the arthropod cuticle move its parts around the joints (see Figure 31.4).
7.47.3.2.2.6	Growth of animals with exoskeletons is accommodated by molting (see Figure 31.3).
7.47.3.2.2.7	Soft-shelled crabs, a gourmet delicacy, are crabs caught while they are molting.
7.47.3.3.1.1	The endoskeleton of vertebrates is an internal scaffolding.
7.47.3.3.1.2	Muscles are attached to it and pull against it.
7.47.3.3.1.3	Endoskeletons are composed of rodlike, platelike, and tubelike bones connected to one another at a variety of joints that allow a wide range of movements.
7.47.3.3.1.4	An advantage of endoskeletons over the exoskeletons of arthropods is that bones in the body can grow without the animal shedding its skeleton.
7.47.3.3.2.1	The adult human skeleton consists of 206 bones, some of which are shown in Figure 47.15.
7.47.3.3.2.2	It can be divided into an axial skeleton, which includes the skull, vertebral column, sternum, and ribs; and an appendicular skeleton, which includes the pectoral girdle, pelvic girdle, and bones of the arms, legs, hands, and feet.
7.47.3.3.2.3	Figure 47.15 The Human Endoskeleton
7.47.3.3.3.1	The vertebrate endoskeleton consists of two kinds of connective tissue, cartilage and bone, which are produced by two kinds of connective tissue cells that produce extensive extracellular matrices.
7.47.3.3.3.2	Cartilage cells produce a matrix that is a tough, rubbery mixture of polysaccharides and proteins   mainly fibrous collagen.
7.47.3.3.3.3	Collagen fibers run in all directions like reinforcing cords through the gel-like matrix and give it the well-known strength and resiliency of gristle in meat.
7.47.3.3.3.4	Cartilage is found in parts of the endoskeleton where both stiffness and resiliency are required, such as on the surfaces of joints where bones move against one another.
7.47.3.3.3.5	Cartilage is also the supportive tissue in stiff but flexible structures such as the larynx (voice box), nose, and ear pinnae.
7.47.3.3.3.6	Sharks and rays are called cartilaginous fishes because their skeletons are composed entirely of cartilage.
7.47.3.3.3.7	In most other vertebrates, cartilage is the principal component of the embryonic skeleton, but during development most of it is gradually replaced by bone.
7.47.3.3.4.1	Bone also contains collagen fibers, but it gets its rigidity and hardness from an extracellular matrix of insoluble calcium phosphate crystals.
7.47.3.3.4.2	Bone serves as a reservoir of calcium for the rest of the body and is in dynamic equilibrium with soluble calcium in the extracellular fluids of the body.
7.47.3.3.4.3	This equilibrium is under the control of calcitonin and parathyroid hormone (see Figure 40.13).
7.47.3.3.4.4	If too much calcium is taken from the skeleton, the bones are significantly weakened.
7.47.3.3.5.1	The living cells of bone   osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts   are responsible for the constant dynamic remodeling of bone (Figure 47.16).
7.47.3.3.5.2	Osteoblasts lay down new matrix material on bone surfaces.
7.47.3.3.5.3	These cells gradually become surrounded by matrix and eventually become enclosed within the bone, at which point they cease laying down matrix but continue to exist within small lacunae (cavities) in the bone.
7.47.3.3.5.4	In this state they are called osteocytes.
7.47.3.3.5.5	Despite the vast amounts of matrix between them, osteocytes remain in contact with one another through long cellular extensions that run through tiny channels in the bone.
7.47.3.3.5.6	Communication between osteocytes is important in controlling the activities of the cells that are laying down or removing bone.
7.47.3.3.5.7	Figure 47.16 Bone Is Living Tissue
7.47.3.3.6.1	The cells that break down bone and release calcium into the extracellular fluid are called osteoclasts.
7.47.3.3.6.2	They are derived from the same cell lineage that produces white blood cells.
7.47.3.3.6.3	Osteoclasts erode bone, forming cavities and tunnels.
7.47.3.3.6.4	Osteoblasts follow osteoclasts, depositing new bone.
7.47.3.3.6.5	Thus the interplay of osteoblasts and osteoclasts constantly replaces and remodels the bones, allowing a bone to recover from damage and adjust to the forces placed on it.
7.47.3.3.7.1	A dramatic finding from the early days of manned space missions was that the bones of astronauts who spent long periods in zero gravity decalcified.
7.47.3.3.7.2	Conversely, in athletes, certain bones thicken during training.
7.47.3.3.7.3	Both thickening and thinning of bones are experienced by anyone who has had a leg in a cast for a long time: the bones of the uninjured leg carry the person&#8217;s weight and thicken while the bones of the inactive leg in the cast thin.
7.47.3.3.7.4	We now know that there are multiple mechanisms in bone that transduce physical stress into activation of various cell signaling mechanisms that can control the bone remodeling responses to those stressors.
7.47.3.3.8.1	Because of the positive effects of physical stress on bone deposition, weight-bearing exercise is effective in preventing and treating osteoporosis, which is the loss of bone density (and hence strength).
7.47.3.3.8.2	More than 25 million people in the United States suffer from this debilitating condition.
7.47.3.3.8.3	Although osteoporosis is most commonly a problem for postmenopausal women, it can occur in younger people as a result of malnutrition.
7.47.3.3.8.4	For example, the condition known as female athlete triad includes eating disorders, cessation of menstrual cycling, and osteoporosis.
7.47.3.3.8.5	These are interactive conditions in which the eating disorder and excessive training lead to malnutrition that can result in endocrine disruption and osteoporosis.
7.47.3.3.8.6	Excessive training and malnutrition can lead to bone loss in males as well.
7.47.3.4.1.1	Bones are divided into two types on the basis of how they develop.
7.47.3.4.1.2	Membranous bone forms on a scaffold of connective tissue membrane.
7.47.3.4.1.3	Cartilage bone forms first as a cartilaginous structure resembling the future mature bone, then gradually hardens, or ossifies, to become bone.
7.47.3.4.1.4	The outer bones of the skull are membranous bones; the bones of the limbs are cartilage bones.
7.47.3.4.2.1	Cartilage bones can grow throughout the ossification process.
7.47.3.4.2.2	The long bones of the legs and arms, for example, ossify first at the centers and later at each end (Figure 47.17).
7.47.3.4.2.3	The cartilage between these ossification centers forms epiphyseal plates.
7.47.3.4.2.4	Growth can continue until these areas of ossification join, eliminating the epiphyseal plates.
7.47.3.4.2.5	The membranous bones forming the skull cap grow until their edges meet.
7.47.3.4.2.6	The large soft spot on the top of a baby&#8217;s head, called a fontanel, is a point where the skull bones have not yet joined.
7.47.3.4.2.7	There are multiple fontanels in the neonate where the skull bones eventually join.
7.47.3.4.3.1	Figure 47.17 The Growth of Long Bones
7.47.3.4.4.1	The structure of bone may be compact (solid and hard) or cancellous (having numerous internal cavities that make it appear spongy, although it is rigid).
7.47.3.4.4.2	The architecture of a specific bone depends on its position and function, but most bones have both compact and cancellous regions.
7.47.3.4.4.3	The shafts of the long bones of the limbs, for example, are cylinders of compact bone surrounding central cavities that contain fatty bone marrow called yellow bone marrow.
7.47.3.4.4.4	The rigid, tubelike shaft of compact bone can withstand compression and bending forces.
7.47.3.4.4.5	Architects and nature alike use hollow tubes as lightweight structural elements.
7.47.3.4.5.1	The ends of the long bones are cancellous (see Figure 47.17).
7.47.3.4.5.2	Cancellous bone is lightweight because of its numerous cavities.
7.47.3.4.5.3	These cavities contain the red bone marrow responsible for red blood cell formation as well as other cellular elements of the blood.
7.47.3.4.5.4	Cancellous bone is also strong because its internal meshwork constitutes a support system.
7.47.3.4.5.5	It can withstand considerable forces of compression.
7.47.3.4.5.6	Figure 47.18 Most Compact Bone Is Composed of Haversian Systems
7.47.3.4.6.1	Most compact bone in mammals is called Haversian bone because it is composed of structural units called Haversian systems (Figure 47.18).
7.47.3.4.6.2	Each Haversian system is a set of thin, concentric bony cylinders that surround a narrow canal, the Haversian canal, that contains blood vessels and nerves.
7.47.3.4.6.3	Osteocytes are arranged in small spaces between the concentric circles of bone surrounding the canals.
7.47.3.4.6.4	Adjacent Haversian systems are separated by boundaries called glue lines.
7.47.3.4.6.5	Haversian bone is resistant to fracturing because cracks tend to stop at glue lines.
7.47.3.5.1.1	Muscles and bones work together around joints, where two or more bones come together.
7.47.3.5.1.2	Different kinds of joints allow motion in different directions (Figure 47.19), but muscles can exert force in only one direction.
7.47.3.5.1.3	Therefore muscles create movement around joints by working in antagonistic pairs: when one muscle contracts, the other relaxes.
7.47.3.5.1.4	When both contract, the joint becomes rigid (which is important for maintaining posture, for example).
7.47.3.5.1.5	Figure 47.19 Types of Joint Motions
7.47.3.5.2.1	With respect to a particular joint, such as the knee, we refer to the muscle that bends, or flexes, the joint as the flexor, and the muscle that straightens, or extends, the joint as the extensor.
7.47.3.5.2.2	The bones that meet at the joint are held together by ligaments, which are flexible bands of connective tissue.
7.47.3.5.2.3	Other straps of connective tissue, called tendons, attach the muscles to the bones.
7.47.3.5.2.4	In Figure 47.20, which shows the knee joint, you can see a tendon that connects a flexor muscle in the upper leg (biceps femoris) to a bone in the lower leg.
7.47.3.5.2.5	You can also see a tendon connecting the extensor muscle (quadriceps) to the kneecap (patella) and the patellar ligament that connects the patella to the lower leg bone.
7.47.3.5.2.6	It is the patellar ligament that is tapped when testing the knee-jerk reflex (see Figure 44.14).
7.47.3.5.2.7	Figure 47.20 Joints, Ligaments, and Tendons
7.47.3.5.3.1	Bones constitute a system of levers that are moved around joints by the muscles.
7.47.3.5.3.2	Levers have three parts: load arm, force arm, and fulcrum.
7.47.3.5.3.3	The joint is the fulcrum, and the length of the force arm relative to the load arm depends on where the muscle attaches to the bone.
7.47.3.5.3.4	Three classes of levers are defined based on the location of the fulcrum (Figure 47.21).
7.47.3.5.3.5	In a class 1 lever, the fulcrum is between the load and force arms, as in a see-saw.
7.47.3.5.3.6	An example is the joint between the skull and the spinal cord.
7.47.3.5.3.7	A class 2 lever is like a wheelbarrow, with the load in the middle.
7.47.3.5.3.8	An example is the ankle joint and the muscle in the back of the leg that enables you to walk and stand on tiptoe.
7.47.3.5.3.9	In a class 3 lever, the force arm is between the fulcrum and the load.
7.47.3.5.3.10	An example is your elbow or your knee.
7.47.3.5.3.11	The length ratio of the load and force arms determines whether a particular lever can exert a lot of force over a short distance or is better at translating force into large or fast movements.
7.47.3.5.3.12	Think of the powerful jaws of carnivores that can easily crack bones.
7.47.3.5.3.13	In contrast, the force arm of the lower legs of Rosie the Ribeter and Jackie Joyner-Kersee, featured in the opener to this chapter, is short relative to the load arm, so they can jump fast and high.
7.47.3.5.4.1	Figure 47.21 Bones and Joints Work as Levers
7.47.3.5.5.1	investigatinglife
7.47.3.5.6.1	What adaptations optimize the jumping muscles of the frog?
7.47.3.5.7.1	Rosie the Ribeter was an exceptional jumper judged by the length of time her record remains unbeaten, but frogs in general are remarkable jumpers.
7.47.3.5.7.2	This ability is not due to the molecular structure of their muscles, as the arrangement of sarcomeres is very similar across a wide cross section of animals, and in all cases, the sarcomeres and therefore the muscles only contract by about 25   30 percent of their length.
7.47.3.5.7.3	So how can a muscle only a few centimeters long produce a jump of many meters?
7.47.3.5.7.4	One answer, which is considered in the experiments described in Investigating Life: What Is the Optimal Resting Position for the Jumping Muscle of the Frog?, involves maximizing force and power.
7.47.3.5.7.5	First, you saw that the resting posture of the frog maintains the sarcomere length where it can generate the maximum force when it contracts.
7.47.3.5.7.6	Then by using the measured force/velocity curve, you saw that the velocity of the jump was at the level that maximized the power of the jump.
7.47.3.5.7.7	This rather fast velocity of contraction is possible because the jumping muscle contains mostly fast-twitch fibers.
7.47.3.5.7.8	As mentioned in the opening story, and further explained in Key Concept 47.3, the legs operate as class 3 levers to move the body mass.
7.47.3.5.7.9	Because the legs of the frog are long, the load arms of those levers are long in comparison with the force arms   that is, the length ratio of the load and force arms is high.
7.47.3.5.7.10	A frog&#8217;s long legs and big feet have another advantage as well.
7.47.3.5.7.11	Muscles must have something to exert force against to maximize power, and once the frog leaves the ground, its muscles can no longer generate power.
7.47.3.5.7.12	Long legs and feet ensure that as the jumping muscles contract, the feet remain in contact with the ground for a longer time, thus maximizing the power of the jump.
7.47.3.5.8.1	Future directions
7.47.3.5.9.1	Understanding how muscles and skeletal structures work together to generate movements of different types is essential in the growing field of robotics.
7.47.3.5.9.2	Robots that repeat the same movement over and over are quite common in manufacturing, but more and more robotic systems are being created to do more variable and complex tasks that mimic and frequently augment the abilities of humans and other animals.
7.47.3.5.9.3	For example, robots have been developed to travel over rough terrain, even while carrying heavy loads.
7.47.3.5.9.4	Robots have been developed to do household chores such as washing dishes and folding laundry.
7.47.3.5.9.5	Robotic systems are improving the functionality of prosthetic limbs for amputees.
7.47.3.5.9.6	And melding of robotic systems with normal human functionality is leading to technologies called &#8220;exoskeletons&#8221; that greatly enhance the physical abilities of humans.
7.47.3.5.9.7	The starting point in all of these engineering efforts is a thorough characterization of how the biological musculoskeletal system works.
7.47.3.5.10.1	47.3 recap
7.47.3.5.11.1	Muscles can only contract and relax; to achieve organized movement, they must pull against rigid structures   other muscles, hydrostatic skeletons, exoskeletons, or endoskeletons.

7.48.9.1	The Breath of Life
7.48.10.1	Elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) on a beach are impressive.
7.48.10.2	Typical adult males are 5 meters long and weigh 2,500 kilograms.
7.48.10.3	They fight viciously to defend areas of beach where the females come out of the water to give birth and rear their young.
7.48.10.4	Thus the beach masters are really defending their opportunities to father the next generation.
7.48.11.1	Physiologically, these animals are even more impressive in the water.
7.48.11.2	Female elephant seals, half the size of the males and therefore easier and safer to manage for experiments, have been fitted with instruments to record the depth and duration of their dives after they leave the beach where they gave birth.
7.48.11.3	They spend up to 7 months at sea, and during that entire time they dive continually   day and night   to feed on eels, skates, rays, squid, and other prey.
7.48.11.4	Most dives are 300   600 meters deep and last 20 minutes, but dives lasting over an hour and exceeding 2,000 meters have been recorded.
7.48.11.5	The seals spend only 4   5 minutes at the surface between dives.
7.48.11.6	Thus for the 80 percent of their lives that they spend at sea, they are breathing only about 20 percent of the time   12 minutes per hour!
7.48.12.1	The best human divers are perhaps the pearl divers of Japan and Korea.
7.48.12.2	They typically dive repeatedly during their workday to about 20 meters, and their dives last about a minute.
7.48.12.3	Record breath-hold dives for humans resting facedown in a pool are about 10 minutes, but that is a one-time event that cannot be repeated for many hours.
7.48.12.4	The elephant seals are not resting   they are descending and ascending great distances and pursuing prey.
7.48.13.1	How can these behemoths spend so much time not breathing?
7.48.13.2	How can they survive such crushing depths?
7.48.13.3	How can they not get the bends, which is a danger for human divers?
7.48.13.4	How much oxygen do these animals need to carry out their normal behavior?
7.48.13.5	How much oxygen can they store in their bodies during the short times they spend at the surface?
7.48.13.6	And what adaptations do they have to make those oxygen stores last as long as they do?
7.48.13.7	To answer these questions, elephant seals and other diving animals have been studied in unique laboratory facilities and in the field.
7.48.14.1	What adaptations make seals champion breath-hold divers?
7.48.15.1	Chapter 48 continues with
7.48.16.1	48.1 Respiratory Gas Exchange Is Governed by Physical Factors
7.48.1.1.1	Diffusion of gases is driven by partial pressure differences
7.48.1.2.1	Fick&#39;s law applies to all systems of gas exchange
7.48.1.3.1	Air is a better respiratory medium than water
7.48.1.4.1	High temperatures create respiratory problems for aquatic animals
7.48.1.5.1	O2 availability decreases with altitude
7.48.1.6.1	CO2 is lost by diffusion
7.48.1.7.1	The respiratory gases that animals must exchange are oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2).
7.48.1.7.2	Cells need to obtain O2 from the environment to produce an adequate supply of ATP by cellular respiration (see Chapter 9).
7.48.1.7.3	CO2 is an end product of cellular respiration, and it must be removed from the body to prevent toxic effects.
7.48.1.7.4	Gas exchange systems of animals consist of (1) specialized body surface areas where these gases can move between the body and the external environment, (2) mechanisms that ventilate the environmental side of those surfaces with air or water, and (3) mechanisms that circulate extracellular fluids on the internal sides.
7.48.1.8.1	focus your learning
7.48.1.9.1	Respiratory gases diffuse from areas of higher partial pressure to areas of lower partial pressure.
7.48.1.10.1	Fick&#8217;s law of diffusion describes the factors that determine the rate of diffusion of a gas between two locations.
7.48.1.11.1	Rising temperature decreases oxygen solubility in water and increases the metabolism of aquatic ectotherms.
7.48.1.12.1	With increasing altitude, oxygen partial pressure decreases, which decreases the rate of oxygen diffusion into the respiratory systems of animals.
7.48.1.13.1	Diffusion is the only means by which respiratory gases are exchanged between an animal&#8217;s internal body fluids and the outside medium (air or water).
7.48.1.13.2	There are no active transport mechanisms to move respiratory gases across biological membranes.
7.48.1.13.3	Because diffusion is a physical process, knowing what physical factors influence rates of diffusion helps us understand the diverse adaptations of gas exchange systems.
7.48.1.13.4	(You may want to review the coverage of diffusion in Key Concept 6.3. )
7.48.1.1.1.1	Diffusion is due to the random motion of molecules, and it results in a net movement of molecules from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration.
7.48.1.1.1.2	In other words, diffusion evens out the distribution of molecules.
7.48.1.1.1.3	Diffusion of respiratory gases occurs either in water or in air.
7.48.1.1.1.4	Concentrations of gases in water or air vary with pressure because gases are compressible, a relationship described in physics by Boyle&#8217;s Law.
7.48.1.1.1.5	For example, there are twice as many gas molecules in a liter of gas at 2 atmospheres of pressure as there are in a liter of gas at 1 atmosphere of pressure.
7.48.1.1.1.6	And if that gas is in contact with a liquid such as water, twice as many gas molecules will enter into solution when the gas pressure is 2 atmospheres than when it is 1 atmosphere.
7.48.1.1.2.1	The concentrations of different gases in a mixture are described as the partial pressures of those gases.
7.48.1.1.2.2	To calculate the partial pressure of a gas such as oxygen in a mixture of gases such as air, we have to know the total pressure.
7.48.1.1.2.3	The total pressure of air inhaled by air-breathing animals is the atmospheric pressure.
7.48.1.1.2.4	At sea level, atmospheric pressure is about 760 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), depending on the weather.
7.48.1.1.2.5	Because dry air is 20.9 percent O2, the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) at sea level is 20.9 percent of 760 mm Hg, or about 159 mm Hg.
7.48.1.1.2.6	If two gas mixtures are separated by a membrane permeable to O2, O2 will diffuse from the mixture where its partial pressure is higher to the mixture where its partial pressure is lower.
7.48.1.1.3.1	To calculate the concentration of O2 in the environment of a water breather, we have to know two things: the partial pressure of O2 in the air in contact with the water, and the solubility of O2 in water.
7.48.1.1.3.2	The amount of a gas that dissolves in a liquid depends both on its partial pressure in the gas phase in contact with the liquid and on its solubility in that liquid.
7.48.1.1.3.3	The diffusion of a gas between the gas phase and the liquid phase is a function of its partial pressures in those two phases; the gas diffuses from the phase with the higher partial pressure to the phase with the lower partial pressure until equilibrium is reached   the point at which the partial pressures in the two phases are equal.
7.48.1.1.3.4	However, the amount of the gas that can be contained in the liquid depends on the solubility of that gas in that liquid.
7.48.1.1.3.5	Furthermore, the solubility of a gas in a particular liquid can vary widely depending on conditions.
7.48.1.1.3.6	What follows is a practical illustration of these facts.
7.48.1.1.4.1	Solubility of a gas in a liquid, such as oxygen in water, is a function of temperature   solubility is higher at low temperatures.
7.48.1.1.4.2	Think of opening a bottle of warm soda in comparison to a bottle of cold soda.
7.48.1.1.4.3	There is more gas out of solution   more fizz   in the warm soda.
7.48.1.1.4.4	So if we have similar containers of water in equilibrium with air, but at different temperatures, the concentrations of oxygen in these water containers will be different (less O2 in the warmer one), but the partial pressures of oxygen will be the same.
7.48.1.1.4.5	Thus for water-breathing animals, the warmer the water is, the less O2 there is per liter of water.
7.48.1.1.4.6	The important point is that for a gas in solution, its concentration is not the same as its partial pressure, but partial pressures are what drive diffusion.
7.48.1.1.4.7	Thus in our continuing discussions of respiratory gas exchange, we will always use partial pressure rather than concentration when referring to the diffusion of respiratory gases.
7.48.1.2.1.1	Whether in air or water, the diffusion rates of respiratory gases depend on their partial pressure gradients and on other factors that can be described quantitatively with a simple equation called Fick&#8217;s law of diffusion.
7.48.1.2.1.2	All environmental variables that limit respiratory gas exchange and all adaptations that maximize respiratory gas exchange are reflected in one or more components of this equation.
7.48.1.2.1.3	Fick&#8217;s law is written as
7.48.1.2.2.1	where
7.48.1.2.3.1	Q is the rate at which a gas such as O2 diffuses between two locations.
7.48.1.2.4.1	D is the diffusion coefficient, which is a characteristic of the diffusing substance, the medium, and the temperature.
7.48.1.2.4.2	For example, perfume has a higher D than motor oil vapor, and all substances diffuse faster at higher temperatures and faster in air than in water.
7.48.1.2.4.3	Temperature is not expressed explicitly in Fick&#8217;s law because the diffusion coefficient is usually determined at room temperature (about 20&#0176;C).
7.48.1.2.5.1	A is the area across which the gas is diffusing.
7.48.1.2.6.1	P1 and P2 are the partial pressures of the gas at the two locations.
7.48.1.2.7.1	L is the path length, or distance, between the two locations.
7.48.1.2.8.1	(P1     P2)/L is a partial pressure gradient.
7.48.1.2.9.1	The strict dependence of animals on diffusion for gas exchange with their environments has selected for various adaptations that maximize Q, many of which we will describe in this chapter.
7.48.1.2.9.2	Animals can maximize D for respiratory gases by using air rather than water as their gas exchange medium whenever possible.
7.48.1.2.9.3	All other adaptations for maximizing respiratory gas exchange must influence the surface area (A) for gas exchange or the partial pressure gradient across that surface area.
7.48.1.3.1.1	The slow diffusion of O2 molecules in water affects both air- and water-breathing animals.
7.48.1.3.1.2	Eukaryotic cells carry out cellular respiration in their mitochondria, which are located in the cytoplasm   an aqueous medium.
7.48.1.3.1.3	Cells are bathed in extracellular fluid   also an aqueous medium.
7.48.1.3.1.4	In addition, all respiratory surfaces must be protected from drying out by a thin film of fluid through which O2 must diffuse.
7.48.1.3.1.5	Even in air-breathing animals, the slow rate of O2 diffusion in water limits the efficiency of O2 distribution from gas exchange surfaces to the sites of cellular respiration.
7.48.1.3.1.6	Figure 48.1 Keeping in Touch with the Medium
7.48.1.3.2.1	Diffusion of O2 in water is so slow that even animal cells with low rates of metabolism cannot function more than a few millimeters away from a good source of environmental O2.
7.48.1.3.2.2	Therefore there are severe size and shape limits on the many species of invertebrates that lack internal systems for distributing O2.
7.48.1.3.2.3	Most of these species are very small, but some, such as marine flatworms, have grown larger by evolving a flat, thin body with a large external surface area (Figure 48.1A).
7.48.1.3.2.4	Another strategy is seen in sponges, which have bodies made of cells that surround water channels through which the external medium flows (Figure 48.1B) (see also Figure 30.2B).
7.48.1.3.2.5	A critical factor enabling larger, more complex animal bodies has been the evolution of specialized respiratory systems with large surface areas such as gills that are highly permeable to respiratory gases (Figure 48.1C).
7.48.1.3.3.1	O2 can be obtained more easily from air than from water for several reasons:
7.48.1.3.4.1	The O2 content of air is much higher than the O2 content of an equal volume of water.
7.48.1.3.4.2	The maximum O2 content of a bubbling stream in equilibrium with air is less than 10 milliliters (mL) of O2 per liter of water.
7.48.1.3.4.3	The O2 content of the air over the stream is about 200 mL of O2 per liter of air.
7.48.1.3.5.1	O2 diffuses about 8,000 times more rapidly in air than in water.
7.48.1.3.5.2	That is why the O2 content of a stagnant pond can be zero only a few millimeters below the surface.
7.48.1.3.6.1	An animal has to work (expend energy) to ventilate its gas exchange surfaces with water or air.
7.48.1.3.6.2	More energy is required to move water than air because water is 800 times denser than air and about 50 times more viscous.
7.48.1.3.7.1	You can appreciate how important these facts were for the evolutionary transition of life to the terrestrial environment, because they meant that there were fewer constraints on the evolution of higher metabolic rates.
7.48.1.4.1.1	Figure 48.2 The Double Bind of Water Breathers
7.48.1.4.2.1	Animals that use water for their respiratory exchange medium are in a double bind when environmental temperatures rise.
7.48.1.4.2.2	Most water-breathing animals are ectotherms   their body temperatures are closely tied to the temperature of the water around them.
7.48.1.4.2.3	As the water temperature rises, an ectotherm&#8217;s body temperature and metabolic rate rise (see Figure 39.8).
7.48.1.4.2.4	Thus water breathers need more O2 as the water gets warmer (Figure 48.2).
7.48.1.4.2.5	But as mentioned above, warm water holds less dissolved gas than cold water does.
7.48.1.4.2.6	In addition, since a water-breathing animal performs work to move water across its gas exchange surfaces, it must expend more energy to breathe as water temperature rises.
7.48.1.4.2.7	Therefore, as water temperature goes up, a water-breathing animal must extract more and more O2 from an environment that is increasingly O2 deficient, and a lower percentage of that O2 is available to support activities other than breathing.
7.48.1.5.1.1	Just as a rise in water temperature reduces the supply of O2 available to water-breathing animals, an increase in altitude reduces the O2 supply for air breathers.
7.48.1.5.1.2	At all altitudes, O2 makes up 20.9 percent of the dry air; however, as you go up in altitude, the total amount of gas per unit of volume decreases, as reflected in the atmospheric pressure.
7.48.1.5.1.3	For example, at 5,800 meters, atmospheric pressure is only half what it is at sea level, so the PO2 at that altitude is only about 80 mm Hg.
7.48.1.5.1.4	At the summit of Mount Everest (8,850 m), PO2 is only about 50 mm Hg   roughly one-third what it is at sea level.
7.48.1.5.2.1	Because the movement of O2 across respiratory gas exchange surfaces and into the body depends on diffusion, its rate of movement depends on the PO2 difference between the air and the body fluids.
7.48.1.5.2.2	Therefore the drastically reduced PO2 in the air at high altitudes constrains O2 uptake.
7.48.1.5.2.3	Because of this, mountain climbers attempting peaks such as Mount Everest or K2 usually breathe O2 from pressurized bottles.
7.48.1.6.1.1	Respiratory gas exchange is a two-way process: CO2 diffuses out of the body as O2 diffuses in.
7.48.1.6.1.2	The direction and rate of diffusion of the respiratory gases across the exchange surfaces depend on the partial pressure gradients of the gases.
7.48.1.6.1.3	The partial pressure gradients of O2 and CO2 across these exchange surfaces are quite different.
7.48.1.6.1.4	The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is extremely low (0.03%), so for air-breathing animals there is always a large concentration gradient for diffusion of CO2 from the body to the environment.
7.48.1.6.1.5	Whereas the partial pressure gradient for O2 decreases with increasing altitude, the gradient driving CO2 out of the body hardly changes.
7.48.1.6.1.6	The partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) in the atmosphere is close to zero both at sea level and atop Mount Everest.
7.48.1.6.2.1	In general, getting rid of CO2 is not a problem for water-breathing animals because CO2 is much more soluble in water than is O2.
7.48.1.6.2.2	Even in stagnant water, where the PCO2 is higher than in moving water, the lack of O2 becomes a problem for an animal long before CO2 exchange difficulties arise.
7.48.1.6.3.1	48.1 recap
7.48.1.6.4.1	Respiratory gases are exchanged only by diffusion.
7.48.1.6.4.2	All factors influencing respiratory gas exchanges are components of Fick&#8217;s law of diffusion.
7.48.1.6.4.3	Air is a better respiratory medium than water because a given volume of air has more O2 than the same volume of water.
7.48.1.6.4.4	O2 diffuses faster in air than in water, and less work is required to move air over respiratory exchange surfaces.
7.48.1.6.4.5	CO2 exchange with the external environment occurs readily because of a large concentration gradient from the body to the environment and because CO2 is highly soluble in water.
7.48.1.6.5.1	learning outcomes
7.48.1.6.6.1	You should be able to:
7.48.1.6.7.1	Analyze changes in partial pressure of a gas at different altitudes and at different depths under water.
7.48.1.6.8.1	Apply Fick&#8217;s law to explain animal adaptations that influence respiratory gas exchange.
7.48.1.6.9.1	Describe three factors that require a fish to increase its gill ventilation in response to an increase in its environmental temperature.
7.48.1.6.10.1	Explain how altitude influences respiratory gas exchange in terms of partial pressures of gases.
7.48.1.6.11.1	What is the partial pressure of oxygen in inhaled air at sea level; at 2,000 meters above sea level, where atmospheric pressure is 80 percent that of sea level; and while breathing air at the same pressure as the environment at 10 meters (= an additional 1 atmosphere of pressure) underwater?
7.48.1.6.12.1	Flatworms (see Figure 48.1A) are invertebrates that do not have a respiratory system.
7.48.1.6.12.2	What two components of Fick&#8217;s law enable them to satisfy their need for oxygen?
7.48.1.6.13.1	The O2 content of water decreases with an increase in water temperature, but the gill ventilation rate of a fish increases much more than is necessary to match that decrease in O2 availability.
7.48.1.6.13.2	Why?
7.48.1.6.14.1	In terms of Fick&#8217;s law, what is the difference between the ability to exchange O2 and CO2 at sea level and at high altitude?
7.48.1.6.15.1	Now that we have discussed the physical factors that influence diffusion rates of respiratory gases between animals and their environments, let&#8217;s look at some of the adaptations that have evolved for maximizing respiratory gas exchange.
7.48.1.6.16.1	Chapter 48 continues with
7.48.1.6.17.1	48.2 Enhancing Diffusion Maximizes Respiratory Gas Exchange
7.48.2.1.1	Respiratory organs have large surface areas
7.48.2.2.1	Ventilation and perfusion of gas exchange surfaces maximize partial pressure gradients
7.48.2.3.1	Insects have airways throughout their bodies
7.48.2.4.1	Fish gills use countercurrent flow to maximize gas exchange
7.48.2.5.1	Birds use unidirectional ventilation to maximize gas exchange
7.48.2.6.1	Tidal ventilation produces dead space that limits gas exchange efficiency
7.48.2.7.1	Small residual volume prevents the bends in seals
7.48.2.8.1	Adaptations to maximize respiratory gas exchange are reflected in the values of Fick&#8217;s law of diffusion Q = DA(P1     P2)/L. Such adaptations have to do one or more of the following:
7.48.2.9.1	Increase the surface area for gas exchange (A)
7.48.2.10.1	Maximize the partial pressure difference driving diffusion (P1     P2)
7.48.2.11.1	Minimize the diffusion path length (L)
7.48.2.12.1	Minimize the diffusion that takes place in an aqueous medium (maximize D)
7.48.2.13.1	With these factors in mind, we will look at four different respiratory systems: those of insects, fishes, birds, and mammals.
7.48.2.14.1	focus your learning
7.48.2.15.1	In insects, efficient gas exchange is facilitated by an internal network of air passages.
7.48.2.16.1	In fishes, countercurrent ventilation and perfusion facilitate efficient gas exchange.
7.48.2.17.1	In birds, anterior and posterior air sacs act as bellows to maintain a continuous unidirectional flow of air through the respiratory system.
7.48.2.18.1	Tidal volume, inspiratory reserve volume, and expiratory reserve volume can be measured directly, and residual volume can be determined using the helium dilution method.
7.48.2.1.1.1	A variety of anatomical adaptations maximize the specialized body surface areas (A) for respiratory gas exchange.
7.48.2.1.1.2	Water-breathing animals generally have gills, and air-breathing animals have tracheae or lungs.
7.48.2.1.1.3	Gills are highly branched and folded extensions of the body surface that provide a large surface area for gas exchange (Figure 48.3A; see also Figure 48.1C).
7.48.2.1.1.4	Because gills consist of thin, delicate tissues, they minimize the path length (L) traversed by diffusing molecules of O2 and CO2.
7.48.2.1.1.5	External gills are found in larval amphibians and in the larvae of many insects.
7.48.2.1.1.6	External gills are vulnerable to damage and are tempting morsels for predators, so in many animals protective body cavities for gills have evolved.
7.48.2.1.1.7	Such internal gills are found in most mollusks and arthropods and in all fishes (Figure 48.3B).
7.48.2.1.1.8	Figure 48.3 Gas Exchange Systems
7.48.2.1.2.1	Lungs are internal cavities for respiratory gas exchange with air (Figure 48.3C).
7.48.2.1.2.2	Their structure is quite different from that of gills.
7.48.2.1.2.3	Lungs have a large surface area because they are highly divided, and because they are elastic, they can be inflated with air and deflated.
7.48.2.1.3.1	Insects have a respiratory gas exchange system consisting of a network of air-filled tubes called tracheae that branch through all tissues of the insect&#8217;s body (Figure 48.3D).
7.48.2.1.3.2	The terminal branches of these tubes are so numerous that they have an enormous surface area compared with the external surface area of the insect&#8217;s body.
7.48.2.2.1.1	Partial pressure gradients [(P1     P2)/L] drive diffusion across gas exchange surfaces; the larger the gradient, the greater the rate of gas exchange.
7.48.2.2.1.2	These gradients can be maximized in several ways:
7.48.2.2.2.1	Minimizing path length: Very thin tissues in gills and lungs reduce the diffusion path length (L).
7.48.2.2.3.1	Ventilating: Actively moving the external medium over the gas exchange surfaces (i. e. , breathing) regularly exposes those surfaces to fresh respiratory medium containing maximum O2 and minimum CO2 concentrations.
7.48.2.2.3.2	This maximizes the partial pressure gradients.
7.48.2.2.4.1	Perfusing: Actively moving the internal medium (e. g. , blood) over the internal side of the exchange surfaces transports CO2 to those surfaces and O2 away from them, thus maximizing the partial pressure gradients driving diffusion.
7.48.2.3.1.1	The tracheal system that enables insects to exchange respiratory gases extends to all tissues in the insect body.
7.48.2.3.1.2	Thus respiratory gases diffuse through air most of the way to and from every cell.
7.48.2.3.1.3	The insect respiratory system communicates with the outside environment through gated openings called spiracles in the sides of the abdomen and thorax (Figure 48.4A and B).
7.48.2.3.1.4	The spiracles open to allow gas exchange and then close to decrease water loss.
7.48.2.3.1.5	They open into tubes called tracheae that branch into even finer tubes, or tracheoles, that end in tiny air capillaries   the actual gas exchange surfaces (Figure 48.4C).
7.48.2.3.1.6	Figure 48.4 The Tracheal Gas Exchange System of Insects
7.48.2.4.1.1	The internal gills of fish are supported by gill arches that lie between the mouth cavity and the protective opercular flaps on the sides of the fish just behind the eyes (Figure 48.5A).
7.48.2.4.1.2	Water flows unidirectionally into the fish&#8217;s mouth, over the gills, and out from under the opercular flaps.
7.48.2.4.1.3	Thus there is a constant one-way flow of oxygenated water over the gills, maximizing the PO2 on the external gill surfaces.
7.48.2.4.1.4	On the internal side of the gill membranes, the circulation of blood minimizes the PO2 by sweeping O2 away as rapidly as it diffuses across.
7.48.2.4.1.5	Figure 48.5 Fish Gills
7.48.2.4.2.1	Gills have an enormous surface area for gas exchange because they are so highly subdivided.
7.48.2.4.2.2	Each gill consists of hundreds of ribbonlike gill filaments (Figure 48.5B).
7.48.2.4.2.3	The upper and lower flat surfaces of each gill filament are covered with rows of evenly spaced folds, or lamellae (Figure 48.5C).
7.48.2.4.2.4	The lamellae are the actual gas exchange surfaces.
7.48.2.4.2.5	Because the lamellae are exceedingly thin, the path length (L) for diffusion of gases between blood and water is minimized.
7.48.2.4.2.6	The surfaces of the lamellae consist of highly flattened epithelial cells, so the water and the fish&#8217;s red blood cells are separated by little more than 1   2 micrometers.
7.48.2.4.3.1	The flow of blood perfusing the inner surfaces of the lamellae, like the flow of water over the gills, is unidirectional.
7.48.2.4.3.2	Afferent blood vessels bring deoxygenated blood to the gills, while efferent blood vessels take oxygenated blood away from the gills (see Figure 48.5C).
7.48.2.4.3.3	Blood flows through the lamellae in the direction opposite to the flow of water over the lamellae.
7.48.2.4.3.4	This countercurrent flow optimizes the PO2 gradient between water and blood, making gas exchange more efficient than it would be in a system using concurrent (parallel) flow (Figure 48.6).
7.48.2.4.3.5	Figure 48.6 Countercurrent Flow Enables More Complete Exchange
7.48.2.4.4.1	Some fishes, including anchovies, tuna, and certain sharks, ventilate their gills by swimming almost constantly with their mouths open.
7.48.2.4.4.2	Most fishes, however, ventilate their gills by means of a two-pump mechanism.
7.48.2.4.4.3	The closing and contracting of the mouth cavity pushes water over the gills, and the expansion of the opercular cavity prior to opening of the opercular flaps pulls water over the gills.
7.48.2.4.5.1	These adaptations for maximizing the surface area (A) for diffusion, minimizing the path length (L) for diffusion, and maximizing the PO2 gradient allow fishes to extract an adequate supply of O2 from meager environmental sources.
7.48.2.5.1.1	Birds are remarkable for their ability to sustain high levels of activity for a long time   for example, on long-distance flights   even at high altitudes where mammals cannot even survive.
7.48.2.5.1.2	The first team to climb Mount Everest (8,850 meters) was surprised to see birds flying over the mountain when they themselves could barely move without supplemental O2.
7.48.2.5.1.3	Bar-headed geese regularly migrate over Mount Everest and surrounding peaks, but the highest recorded flight of a bird is from a Ruppell&#8217;s griffon, a vulture, that was sucked into a jet engine at 11,278 meters.
7.48.2.5.1.4	Humans cannot survive at such altitudes without supplemental O2.
7.48.2.5.1.5	Yet the lungs of a bird are smaller than the lungs of a similar-sized mammal, and bird lungs expand and contract less during a breathing cycle than do mammalian lungs.
7.48.2.5.1.6	And the volume of bird lungs decreases during inhalation and increases during exhalation.
7.48.2.5.1.7	How do birds accomplish such remarkable feats of respiratory gas exchange?
7.48.2.5.2.1	The structure of bird lungs allows air to flow unidirectionally through the lungs, rather than bidirectionally through all the same airways, as it does in tidally ventilating mammals (discussed below).
7.48.2.5.2.2	Because mammalian lungs are never completely emptied of air during exhalation, there is always some lung volume that is not ventilated with fresh air.
7.48.2.5.2.3	The air remaining in lungs and airways after exhalation is called dead space.
7.48.2.5.2.4	Bird lungs, by contrast, have very little dead space, and the fresh incoming air is not mixed with stale air.
7.48.2.5.2.5	In this way, a high PO2 gradient is maintained.
7.48.2.5.3.1	Air sacs are an important and unique feature of the avian respiratory system, and they occupy much of the body cavity of the bird (Figure 48.7A).
7.48.2.5.3.2	They can be divided into a group of anterior air sacs and a group of posterior air sacs.
7.48.2.5.3.3	The air sacs are interconnected with each other, with the lungs, and with air spaces in some of the bones.
7.48.2.5.3.4	The air sacs are not gas exchange surfaces; rather, they act as bellows to maintain a unidirectional flow of air through the lungs.
7.48.2.5.3.5	Figure 48.7 The Respiratory System of a Bird
7.48.2.5.4.1	As in other air-breathing vertebrates, air enters and leaves a bird&#8217;s gas exchange system through the trachea (commonly known as the windpipe, and not to be confused with the air-conducting tracheae of insects) (Figure 48.7B).
7.48.2.5.4.2	The trachea divides into two smaller airways, the primary bronchi (singular bronchus).
7.48.2.5.4.3	The primary bronchi extend all the way to the posterior air sacs and also branch into secondary bronchi.
7.48.2.5.4.4	The posterior air sacs also have connections to the secondary bronchi.
7.48.2.5.4.5	Secondary bronchi divide into tubelike parabronchi that run parallel to one another through the lungs.
7.48.2.5.5.1	Branching off the parabronchi are numerous tiny air capillaries (Figure 48.7C).
7.48.2.5.5.2	Air flows through the parabronchi and diffuses into the air capillaries, which are the gas exchange surfaces.
7.48.2.5.5.3	The air capillaries are so numerous that they provide an enormous surface area for gas exchange.
7.48.2.5.5.4	The blood capillaries are in close contact with the air capillaries, and oxygen from the air diffuses into the blood.
7.48.2.5.5.5	The parabronchi coalesce into larger bronchi that take the air out of the lungs and into anterior air sacs and then back to the trachea.
7.48.2.5.5.6	Thus the anatomy of a bird&#8217;s airways allows air to flow unidirectionally through the lungs: trachea, bronchi, posterior air sacs, parabronchi, bronchi, anterior air sacs, trachea.
7.48.2.5.6.1	The puzzle of how birds breathe was solved by placing small O2 sensors at different locations in birds&#8217; air sacs and airways.
7.48.2.5.6.2	The birds were then allowed to inhale pure O2 for just a single breath, which made it possible to track that particular breath by recording when each of the O2 sensors registered a peak value.
7.48.2.5.6.3	The experiment showed that a single breath remains in a bird&#8217;s respiratory system for two cycles of inhalation and exhalation.
7.48.2.5.6.4	During inhalation, the air sacs expand and air flows through the trachea into the posterior air sacs.
7.48.2.5.6.5	At the same time, the lungs are contracting as air moves from the lungs into the anterior air sacs.
7.48.2.5.6.6	During exhalation, the air sacs contract.
7.48.2.5.6.7	The posterior air sacs push air into the lungs, which are expanding, and the anterior air sacs push air into the trachea and out of the respiratory system.
7.48.2.5.6.8	This bellowslike action of the air sacs maintains a continuous, unidirectional flow of fresh air through the lungs (Figure 48.8).
7.48.2.5.6.9	Figure 48.8 An Experiment to Describe Airflow in Bird Respiratory System
7.48.2.5.7.1	The advantages of the bird respiratory system are similar to those of fish gills.
7.48.2.5.7.2	The air sacs keep fresh air flowing unidirectionally over the gas exchange surfaces without interruption.
7.48.2.5.7.3	Thus those gas exchange surfaces are constantly exposed to a PO2 that is very close to that of the ambient air.
7.48.2.5.7.4	Even at high altitude where the PO2 of the ambient air may be only slightly above that of the blood, O2 can still diffuse from air to blood.
7.48.2.6.1.1	Lungs evolved in early lungfishes as outpocketings of the digestive tract.
7.48.2.6.1.2	Although lung structure has evolved considerably, lungs remain dead-end sacs in all air-breathing vertebrates except birds (and likely their extinct reptilian ancestors).
7.48.2.6.1.3	Ventilation of dead-end sacs with common passageways for inflow and outflow cannot be constant and unidirectional but must be tidal: air flows in and exhaled gases flow out by the same route.
7.48.2.6.1.4	Since the lungs and airways can never be completely emptied of air, they always contain dead space.
7.48.2.6.1.5	We can easily measure the volumes of air exchanged during breathing, but we have to use an indirect method to measure the dead space contained in the lungs and airways.
7.48.2.6.1.6	Measures of dead space are important in assessing lung health and disease.
7.48.2.6.2.1	A flowmeter measures the volume of air breathed in and out (Figure 48.9).
7.48.2.6.2.2	Using a human as an example, the amount of air that moves either in or out per breath when at rest is called the tidal volume (TV) (about 500 mL for an average human adult).
7.48.2.6.2.3	When we breathe in as much as possible, the additional volume is the inspiratory reserve volume (IRV).
7.48.2.6.2.4	Conversely, if we forcefully exhale as much air as possible, the additional amount of air expelled is the expiratory reserve volume (ERV).
7.48.2.6.2.5	The maximum capacity for air exchange in one breath, or the vital capacity (VC), is the sum of TV + IRV + ERV.
7.48.2.6.2.6	The vital capacity of an athlete is generally greater than that of a nonathlete, and vital capacity decreases with age because of stiffening of the lung tissue.

7.48.2.6.8.1	A patient complains of always being short of breath.
7.48.2.6.8.2	Using a flowmeter, the physician determines that the patient&#8217;s tidal volume is 0.3 L and his expiratory reserve volume is 1.5 L The physician decides to use the Fick dilution method to measure the patient&#8217;s residual volume.
7.48.2.6.8.3	She attaches the flowmeter to a 30-liter air reservoir containing 5% helium.
7.48.2.6.8.4	Using a two-way valve, she can have the patient breathe room air or the air in the reservoir.
7.48.2.6.8.5	At the end of a tidal exhalation, the physician turns the valve and lets the patient take 10 breaths from the reservoir.
7.48.2.6.8.6	She then switches the patient to room air at the end of a tidal exhalation.
7.48.2.6.8.7	She determines that the volume of the resevoir is still 30 L, but the helium concentration in the reservoir is now 4.4%.
7.48.2.6.9.1	QUESTIONS
7.48.2.6.10.1	What is the patient&#8217;s residual volume?
7.48.2.6.11.1	Why do you think the patient complains of always being short of breath?
7.48.2.6.12.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.48.2.6.13.1	Vital capacity is not the entire lung capacity because of the dead space, also called the residual volume (RV).
7.48.2.6.13.2	We can&#8217;t measure RV directly with the flowmeter, but we can measure it indirectly using the helium dilution method.
7.48.2.6.13.3	The flowmeter is attached to a closed reservoir of air of a known volume (Vres) so that a person can breathe in and out from that reservoir.
7.48.2.6.13.4	If this reservoir has a known amount of helium (He) in it, and a subject breathes the air in that reservoir through several breathing cycles, the helium will become distributed in the reservoir and in the subject&#8217;s respiratory system.
7.48.2.6.13.5	Helium is not absorbed into the body from the lungs, so the total amount of helium at the beginning of a test (Hei) will equal the total amount at the end of the test (Hef)   it will just be distributed over a larger volume and therefore be less concentrated.
7.48.2.6.13.6	The following formula quantifies that relationship:
7.48.2.6.14.1	Initial amount of He = final amount of He
7.48.2.6.15.1	We start the subject breathing from the reservoir at an end-tidal breath, and we end the breathing from the reservoir at an end-tidal breath.
7.48.2.6.15.2	Since the Vres does not change, the decrease in helium concentration [He] enables us to calculate the subject&#8217;s functional residual volume (FRV), which is the ERV + RV.
7.48.2.6.16.1	Vres &#215; [He]i = (Vres + FRV) &#215; [He]f
7.48.2.6.17.1	Since we can measure the ERV with the flowmeter, we can subtract the ERV from the FRV to obtain the RV.
7.48.2.6.18.1	Why is the RV important?
7.48.2.6.18.2	Referring to Figure 48.9, you will see that for a normal person the ERV is about 1,000 mL and the RV is 1,000 mL.
7.48.2.6.18.3	Thus the FRV is 2,000 mL, but the tidal volume is only 500 mL; this means that the air that reaches the alveoli (the actual gas exchange surfaces) with each breath consists of only 500 mL of fresh air diluted by 2,000 mL of stale air.
7.48.2.6.18.4	The maximum PO2 in this mixed air is much below the PO2 of the outside air, and because of the tidal ventilation pattern, the PO2 in the alveoli is steadily dropping during the breathing cycle.
7.48.2.6.18.5	The RV is important because it contributes to the FRV and to the dilution of the O2 in the inhaled air.
7.48.2.6.18.6	Any disease or condition that increases the RV (such as emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis) compromises a patient&#8217;s respiratory ability.
7.48.2.6.18.7	Similarly, considering the mixing of fresh air with the FRV, you can understand why reductions in tidal volume can be a problem   and therefore why patients recovering from surgery are encouraged to breathe deeply, even if it hurts.
7.48.2.7.1.1	In the opening of this chapter we discussed the remarkable abilities of elephant seals to dive to great depths for long times and then spend only minutes breathing at the surface.
7.48.2.7.1.2	We asked how elephant seals avoid getting the bends, a very painful condition that develops in scuba divers who surface too rapidly after spending time at depths.
7.48.2.7.1.3	The pressure of the water on the body increases by 1 atmosphere for every 10 meters of depth.
7.48.2.7.1.4	Body tissues are not compressible, but air in the respiratory system is, so scuba divers breathe air through a regulator that equalizes the air pressure in their lungs to the pressure of the water on the body.
7.48.2.7.1.5	As the total air pressure goes up, the partial pressures of the component gases go up, increasing their rate of diffusion into the tissues.
7.48.2.7.1.6	Eighty percent of the air is nitrogen, so the amount of nitrogen dissolved in tissues increases.
7.48.2.7.1.7	If the diver comes up too rapidly, the dissolved nitrogen comes out of solution in the tissues, creating small bubbles that block blood vessels, damage tissues, cause pain, and can even result in death.
7.48.2.7.1.8	To avoid the bends, divers use decompression tables that tell them how to ascend depending on how deep and how long their dives have been.
7.48.2.7.1.9	For example, if a diver has spent 1 hour at a depth of 60 meters, he would have to spend 3 hours gradually ascending to shallower and shallower depths to allow the nitrogen dissolved in his tissues to diffuse out through the respiratory system rather than form bubbles in his tissues.
7.48.2.7.1.10	Why does a seal who makes repeated dives not face the same consequences?
7.48.2.7.1.11	The seal exhales before diving and the residual air in its respiratory system gets compressed into its airways, which are not respiratory exchange surfaces.
7.48.2.7.1.12	So, when seals dive they do not have compressible air in their lungs that can be forced into tissues at depth and then come out of solution upon resurfacing.
7.48.2.7.2.1	48.2 recap
7.48.2.7.3.1	The major adaptations that increase efficiency of respiratory gas exchange are large surface areas for exchange and maximized partial pressure gradients across those surfaces.
7.48.2.7.3.2	Fish and avian respiratory systems have continuous and unidirectional ventilation of their respiratory exchange surfaces.
7.48.2.7.3.3	Mammals have tidal ventilation, resulting in residual volumes of O2 that dilute the incoming fresh air.
7.48.2.7.4.1	learning outcomes
7.48.2.7.5.1	You should be able to:
7.48.2.7.6.1	Explain the concept and adaptive significance of countercurrent exchange, using the fish gills as the example.
7.48.2.7.7.1	Describe how the avian respiratory system maximizes the partial pressure gradient for O2 uptake.
7.48.2.7.8.1	Determine the total lung capacity (including residual volume) of a human.
7.48.2.7.9.1	Given constant rates of ventilation and perfusion, how can the directionality of blood and water flow on opposite sides of fish gill membranes influence the maximum O2 exchange that can occur?
7.48.2.7.10.1	How do birds maintain a constant and unidirectional flow of air through their lungs?
7.48.2.7.11.1	Find the functional residual volume of a person who yields the following data while breathing from a flowmeter that has a volume of 30 liters (L) and an initial gas mixture of 20 percent O2, 75 percent nitrogen (N), and 5 percent helium (He).
7.48.2.7.11.2	Beginning with an inhalation, the person inhales and exhales 20 times.
7.48.2.7.11.3	The final concentration of He in the flowmeter is 4.6 percent.
7.48.2.7.12.1	Despite their limitations, mammalian lungs serve the respiratory needs of mammals well.
7.48.2.7.12.2	Offsetting the inefficiencies of tidal breathing, mammalian lungs have an enormous surface area and a very short path length for diffusion.
7.48.2.7.12.3	Next we will look at the human respiratory system as an example.
7.48.2.7.13.1	Chapter 48 continues with
7.48.2.7.14.1	48.3 Humans Have Tidal Respiration
7.48.3.1.1	Lungs are ventilated through a branching system of airways
7.48.3.2.1	Respiratory tract secretions aid ventilation
7.48.3.3.1	Lungs are ventilated by pressure changes in the thoracic cavity
7.48.3.4.1	The respiratory exchange surfaces in mammalian lungs are the very thin-walled alveoli that cluster around a huge number of finely branching terminal airways.
7.48.3.4.2	To understand how these respiratory surfaces are ventilated and perfused, we will first examine the functional anatomy of the whole respiratory system (Focus: Key Figure 48.10).
7.48.3.5.1	focus: key figure
7.48.3.6.1	Figure 48.10 The Human Respiratory System
7.48.3.7.1	The diagrams trace the hierarchy of human respiratory structures, from the airways to the minuscule alveoli.
7.48.3.8.1	Q: If the trachea branches into two bronchi, each of those bronchi branches into two smaller airways, and so forth for 23 branchings, how many terminal airways are there?
7.48.3.9.1	focus your learning
7.48.3.10.1	Mucus traps particulates in the inhaled air and surfactants decrease the work of ventilation.
7.48.3.11.1	Inhalation and exhalation of air result from changes in the volume and the pressure in the thoracic cavity.
7.48.3.1.1.1	Air enters the lungs through the oral cavity or through the nasal passages, which join together in the pharynx (see Figure 48.10A).
7.48.3.1.1.2	Below the pharynx, the esophagus conducts food to the stomach, and the trachea conducts air to the lungs.
7.48.3.1.1.3	At the beginning of this airway is the larynx, or voice box, which houses the vocal cords.
7.48.3.1.1.4	The larynx is the lump that you can see or feel on the front of your neck.
7.48.3.1.1.5	The trachea is about 2 centimeters in diameter.
7.48.3.1.1.6	C-shaped bands of cartilage prevent the thin walls of the trachea from collapsing as air pressure changes during the breathing cycle.
7.48.3.1.1.7	If you run your fingers down the front of your neck just below your larynx, you can feel a few of these bands of cartilage.
7.48.3.1.2.1	The trachea branches into two bronchi, one leading to each lung.
7.48.3.1.2.2	The bronchi branch repeatedly to generate a treelike structure of progressively smaller airways extending to all regions of the lungs.
7.48.3.1.2.3	After four branchings, the cartilage supports disappear, marking the transition to bronchioles.
7.48.3.1.2.4	After about 16 branchings, the bronchioles are less than a millimeter in diameter, and tiny, thin-walled air sacs called alveoli begin to appear.
7.48.3.1.2.5	Alveoli are the sites of gas exchange.
7.48.3.1.2.6	After the first alveoli there are about six more branchings of the airways that end in clusters of alveoli (see Figure 48.10B).
7.48.3.1.2.7	Because the airways conduct air only to and from the alveoli and do not themselves participate in gas exchange, their volume is dead space.
7.48.3.1.3.1	Human lungs have about 300 million alveoli.
7.48.3.1.3.2	Although each alveolus is very small, their combined surface area for diffusion of respiratory gases is about 70 square meters   about one-fourth the size of a basketball court.
7.48.3.1.3.3	The walls of each alveolus are made of very thin cells.
7.48.3.1.3.4	Wrapped around the alveoli are networks of capillaries that also have very thin walls.
7.48.3.1.3.5	Thus where capillary meets alveolus, the diffusion path length between air and blood is less than 2 micrometers (see Figure 48.10C).
7.48.3.1.4.1	Diseases of the bronchioles and alveoli are the third leading cause of death in the United States as of 2014.
7.48.3.1.4.2	Among these diseases, the most lethal is emphysema, a condition in which inflammation damages and eventually destroys the walls of the alveoli.
7.48.3.1.4.3	As a result, the lungs have fewer but larger alveoli, the lungs lose elasticity, and the RV increases.
7.48.3.1.4.4	The principal cause of emphysema is smoking.
7.48.3.2.1.1	Mammalian lungs produce two secretions that do not directly influence their gas exchange but do affect the process of ventilation: mucus and surfactant.
7.48.3.2.2.1	Many cells lining the airways produce sticky mucus that captures bits of dirt and microorganisms that are inhaled.
7.48.3.2.2.2	Other cells lining the airways have cilia that beat continually and sweep the mucus, with its trapped debris, up toward the pharynx, where it is swallowed or spit out.
7.48.3.2.2.3	This phenomenon, called the mucus escalator, can be adversely affected by inhaled pollutants.
7.48.3.2.2.4	Smoking one cigarette can immobilize the cilia of the airways for hours.
7.48.3.2.2.5	A smoker&#8217;s cough results from the need to clear the obstructing mucus from the airways when the mucus escalator is out of order.
7.48.3.2.3.1	A surfactant is a substance that reduces the surface tension of a liquid.
7.48.3.2.3.2	Surface tension gives the surface of a liquid the properties of an elastic membrane, and it is why certain insects, such as water-striders, can walk on water.
7.48.3.2.3.3	As discussed in Key Concept 2.4, surface tension is the result of chemical forces of attraction between water molecules.
7.48.3.2.3.4	The attractive forces working on the water molecules at the surface pull from below and from the sides but not from above.
7.48.3.2.3.5	This imbalance of forces creates surface tension.
7.48.3.2.3.6	The thin film of fluid covering the air-facing surfaces of the alveoli has surface tension that contributes to the lungs&#8217; elasticity.
7.48.3.2.3.7	To inflate the lungs, enough force has to be generated to overcome both the elasticity of the lung tissue and the surface tension in the alveoli.
7.48.3.2.4.1	Lung surfactant is a fatty, detergent-like substance that is critical for reducing the work necessary to inflate the lungs.
7.48.3.2.4.2	Certain cells in the alveoli release surfactant molecules.
7.48.3.2.4.3	If a baby is born more than a month prematurely, these cells may not have developed the ability to produce surfactant.
7.48.3.2.4.4	A baby with this condition, known as respiratory distress syndrome, will have great difficulty breathing and may die from exhaustion and lack of O2.
7.48.3.2.4.5	Common treatments for premature babies have been to put them on respirators to assist their breathing and to give them hormones to speed lung development.
7.48.3.2.4.6	A newer approach is to apply surfactant to the lungs via an aerosol.
7.48.3.3.1.1	Human lungs are suspended in the thoracic cavity, a closed compartment bounded on the bottom by a sheet of muscle called the diaphragm (see Figure 48.10A).
7.48.3.3.1.2	Each lung is covered by a continuous sheet of tissue called the pleural membrane that also lines the thoracic cavity adjacent to the lung.
7.48.3.3.1.3	A thin film of fluid between the pleural membranes of the lung and the thoracic cavity lubricates the inner surfaces of the pleural membranes so they can slip and slide against each other.
7.48.3.3.1.4	As with surface tension, there are forces of attraction between the molecules of fluid covering the pleural membranes.
7.48.3.3.1.5	As a result, it is difficult to pull the pleural membranes apart.
7.48.3.3.1.6	Think of two wet panes of glass or two wet microscope slides; you can slide them past each other, but it is difficult to separate them.
7.48.3.3.1.7	While the inner surfaces of the pleural membranes are &#8220;stuck&#8221; to each other by surface tension, they can move relative to each other during breathing movements.
7.48.3.3.2.1	Inhalation and exhalation involve changes in the volume of the thoracic cavity (Figure 48.11).
7.48.3.3.2.2	Because the pleural membranes covering the cavity wall and the lung surface are stuck to each other by surface tension, any attempt to increase the volume of the thoracic cavity increases the tension between the pleural membranes.
7.48.3.3.2.3	Even between breaths, there is tension between the pleural membranes because the rib cage is pulling outward and the elasticity of the lung tissue is pulling inward.
7.48.3.3.2.4	This slight negative pressure keeps the alveoli partly inflated even at the end of an exhalation.
7.48.3.3.2.5	If the thoracic cavity is punctured   by a knife wound, for example   air can leak into the space between the pleural membranes and cause the lung to deflate.
7.48.3.3.2.6	If the wound is not sealed, breathing movements pull air in between the pleural membranes rather than into the lung (a &#8220;sucking chest wound&#8221;), and there is no ventilation of the alveoli in that lung   a condition called &#8220;collapsed lung. &#8221; Figure 48.11 Into the Lungs and Out Again
7.48.3.3.3.1	At rest, inhalation is initiated by contraction of the muscular diaphragm (see Figure 48.11A).
7.48.3.3.3.2	As the domed diaphragm contracts, it pulls down, expanding the thoracic cavity and pulling on the pleural membranes.
7.48.3.3.3.3	Since the pleural membranes cannot separate, they pull on the lungs increasing their volume, and air rushes in through the trachea from the outside.
7.48.3.3.3.4	Exhalation begins when contraction of the diaphragm ceases.
7.48.3.3.3.5	As the diaphragm relaxes, the elastic recoil of the lung tissues pulls the diaphragm up and pushes air out through the airways (see Figure 48.11B).
7.48.3.3.3.6	When a person is at rest, inhalation is an active process and exhalation is a passive process.
7.48.3.3.4.1	The diaphragm is not the only muscle that can change the volume of the thoracic cavity.
7.48.3.3.4.2	Between the ribs are two sets of intercostal muscles (see Figure 48.11C).
7.48.3.3.4.3	The external intercostal muscles expand the thoracic cavity by lifting the ribs up and outward.
7.48.3.3.4.4	The internal intercostal muscles decrease the volume of the thoracic cavity by pulling the ribs down and inward.
7.48.3.3.4.5	During strenuous exercise, the external intercostal muscles increase the volume of air inhaled, making use of the inspiratory reserve volume, and the internal intercostal muscles increase the amount of air exhaled, making use of the expiratory reserve volume.
7.48.3.3.4.6	The abdominal muscles can also aid in breathing.
7.48.3.3.4.7	When they contract, they cause the abdominal contents to push up on the diaphragm and thereby contribute to the expiratory reserve volume.
7.48.3.3.5.1	Remember that ventilation and perfusion work together to maximize the partial pressure gradients across the alveolar membranes (see Figure 48.11D).
7.48.3.3.5.2	Ventilation delivers O2 to the environmental side of the exchange surface, where it diffuses across and is swept away by the perfusing blood, which carries it to the tissues.
7.48.3.3.5.3	The reverse is true for CO2.
7.48.3.3.5.4	Perfusion delivers CO2 to the exchange surface, where it diffuses across and is swept away by ventilation.
7.48.3.3.6.1	48.3 recap
7.48.3.3.7.1	The mammalian respiratory system consists of a highly branching system of airways that lead to alveoli   the gas exchange surfaces.
7.48.3.3.7.2	Respiratory muscles ventilate the alveoli by creating pressure differences between the lungs and the outside air.
7.48.3.3.7.3	CO2 and O2 are exchanged across thin capillary and alveoli walls by diffusion.
7.48.3.3.8.1	learning outcomes
7.48.3.3.9.1	You should be able to:
7.48.3.3.10.1	Explain the roles of surface tension and surfactant in breathing.
7.48.3.3.11.1	Explain how changes in volume and pressure in the thoracic cavity are involved in ventilation.
7.48.3.3.12.1	Describe the changes (in arbitrary units) in tension between the pleural membranes and the pressure in the alveoli, and air flow during a breathing cycle.
7.48.3.3.13.1	Why do some premature newborns have difficulty breathing?
7.48.3.3.14.1	Why does a puncture wound of the chest cause a collapsed lung?
7.48.3.3.15.1	In the breathing cycle, what is the alveolar pressure when the tension between the pleural membranes is maximal?
7.48.3.3.15.2	Explain your answer.
7.48.3.3.16.1	Having discussed how respiratory gases get to and from the environmental side of the gas exchange membranes through ventilation, we will now look at how these gases get to and from the internal side of those membranes through perfusion.
7.48.3.3.17.1	Chapter 48 continues with
7.48.3.3.18.1	48.4 Respiratory Gases Are Transported by the Blood
7.48.4.1.1	Red blood cells are produced in the bone marrow
7.48.4.2.1	Hemoglobin combines reversibly with O2
7.48.4.3.1	Myoglobin holds an O2 reserve
7.48.4.4.1	Hemoglobin&#39;s affinity for O2 is variable
7.48.4.5.1	Most CO2 is transported as bicarbonate ions in the blood
7.48.4.6.1	Perfusion of the lungs is one of the functions of the circulatory system.
7.48.4.6.2	The circulatory system uses a pump (the heart) and a network of vessels to transport blood around the body.
7.48.4.6.3	Circulatory systems are the subject of Chapter 49, so here we will discuss only one aspect of perfusion: how blood transports respiratory gases.
7.48.4.7.1	focus your learning
7.48.4.8.1	The protein hemoglobin in red blood cells binds, transports, and releases O2 to the tissues of the body.
7.48.4.9.1	Factors influencing the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen include its chemical composition, the PO2 in the blood plasma, the blood pH, and the presence of 2,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid.
7.48.4.10.1	Most of the carbon dioxide produced by body cells is transported from tissues to alveoli in the form of bicarbonate ions dissolved in blood plasma.
7.48.4.11.1	The liquid part of blood, the plasma, carries some O2 in solution, but its ability to transport this nonpolar molecule is limited.
7.48.4.11.2	The blood plasma of a human can contain in solution about 3 mL of O2 per liter of plasma, which is inadequate to support even basal metabolism.
7.48.4.11.3	However, the blood of vertebrates and many invertebrates, contains molecules that bind and release O2 and thus augment its transport capacity.
7.48.4.11.4	These molecules pick up O2 where PO2 is high and release it where PO2 is lower.
7.48.4.11.5	There are many O2 transport molecules in the animal kingdom, but in vertebrates this role is played by hemoglobin, a protein contained in red blood cells (RBCs).
7.48.4.11.6	The percent of the blood volume consisting of RBCs is called the hematocrit.
7.48.4.11.7	The hematocrit of human males averages 45 percent and that of females 40 percent.
7.48.4.11.8	Hemoglobin increases the capacity of blood to carry 60 times more oxygen than it could carry in solution, making high rates of metabolism possible.
7.48.4.1.1.1	In humans, about 25 percent of the cells in the body are RBCs.
7.48.4.1.1.2	They are produced in the bone marrow at a rate of about 2 million per second, and they circulate around the body for 100   120 days before they are destroyed.
7.48.4.1.1.3	Each circuit around the body takes about a minute when at rest.
7.48.4.1.1.4	RBCs are among the smallest cells of the body.
7.48.4.1.1.5	They have to pass through the tiniest blood vessels, the capillaries.
7.48.4.1.1.6	To be so small yet carry a lot of hemoglobin (at least 25% of their volume), RBCs lose their nuclei and most cell organelles prior to being released into the circulation.
7.48.4.1.1.7	Because they have no mitochondria, they depend on *glycolysis for energy.
7.48.4.1.2.1	*connect the concepts In Key Concept 9.1, glycolysis is described as a sequence of reactions that by the sixth step has converted one molecule of glucose to two molecules of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and by the tenth step to two molecules of pyruvate.
7.48.4.1.2.2	However, some of the 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate can be enzymatically converted to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate which plays an important role in regulating the oxygen-binding properties of hemoglobin, as you will learn below.
7.48.4.2.1.1	RBCs contain enormous numbers of hemoglobin molecules.
7.48.4.2.1.2	Hemoglobin is a protein consisting of four polypeptide subunits, each of which surrounds a heme group   an iron-containing ring structure that can reversibly bind a molecule of O2.
7.48.4.2.1.3	Thus each hemoglobin molecule can bind and release up to four O2 molecules, enabling the blood to carry a large amount of O2 to the body&#8217;s tissues.
7.48.4.2.2.1	Hemoglobin&#8217;s ability to pick up or release O2 depends on the PO2 in its environment.
7.48.4.2.2.2	When the PO2 of the blood plasma is high, as it usually is in the lung capillaries, each hemoglobin molecule can carry its maximum load of four O2 molecules.
7.48.4.2.2.3	As the blood circulates through the rest of the body, it releases some of the O2 it carries when it encounters lower PO2 values in tissues.
7.48.4.2.3.1	The relationship between PO2 and the amount of O2 bound to hemoglobin is not linear but S-shaped (sigmoidal).
7.48.4.2.3.2	The hemoglobin   oxygen binding/dissociation curve reflects interactions between the four subunits of the hemoglobin molecule.
7.48.4.2.3.3	At low PO2 values, only one subunit will bind an O2 molecule (Figure 48.12A).
7.48.4.2.3.4	When it does so, the shape of that subunit changes, altering the quaternary structure of the entire hemoglobin molecule.
7.48.4.2.3.5	That structural change makes it easier for the other subunits to bind an O2 molecule; that is, their O2 affinity is increased.
7.48.4.2.3.6	Therefore a smaller increase in PO2 is necessary to get the hemoglobin molecule to bind a second O2 molecule (that is, to become 50% saturated) than was necessary to get it to bind one O2 molecule (to become 25% saturated).
7.48.4.2.3.7	This change in affinity is reflected in the increased steepness of the O2-binding curve.
7.48.4.2.3.8	The influence of O2 binding/dissociation by one subunit on the O2 affinity of the other subunits is called positive cooperativity.
7.48.4.2.3.9	Figure 48.12 Binding of O2 to Hemoglobin Depends on PO2
7.48.4.2.4.1	Once the third O2 molecule is bound, the relationship seems to change, as a larger increase in PO2 is required for the hemoglobin to reach 100 percent saturation.
7.48.4.2.4.2	This upper bend of the sigmoid curve is due to a probability phenomenon.
7.48.4.2.4.3	The closer we get to having all subunits occupied, the less likely it is that any particular O2 molecule will find a place to bind.
7.48.4.2.4.4	Therefore it takes a relatively greater PO2 to achieve 100 percent saturation.
7.48.4.2.5.1	The O2-binding/dissociation properties of hemoglobin help get O2 to the tissues that need it most (Figure 48.12B).
7.48.4.2.5.2	In the lungs, where the PO2 is about 100 mm Hg, hemoglobin is 100 percent saturated.
7.48.4.2.5.3	The PO2 in blood returning to the heart from the body (at rest) is usually about 40 mm Hg.
7.48.4.2.5.4	You can see that at this PO2 the hemoglobin is still about 75 percent saturated.
7.48.4.2.5.5	This means that as the blood circulates around the body, it releases only about one in four of the O2 molecules it carries.
7.48.4.2.5.6	This system seems inefficient, but because the hemoglobin keeps 75 percent of its O2 in reserve, it can meet the demands of highly active tissues.
7.48.4.2.6.1	When a tissue becomes starved of O2 and its local PO2 falls below 40 mm Hg, the hemoglobin flowing through that tissue is on the steep portion of its binding/dissociation curve.
7.48.4.2.6.2	That means relatively small decreases in PO2 below 40 mm Hg will result in the release of lots of O2 to the tissue.
7.48.4.2.6.3	Thus hemoglobin is very effective in making O2 available to tissues precisely when and where it is needed most.
7.48.4.2.7.1	The O2 transport function of hemoglobin can rapidly and tragically be disrupted by a common by-product of incomplete combustion: carbon monoxide (CO).
7.48.4.2.7.2	If CO from a faulty heating system, engine exhaust, or burning charcoal accumulates in a closed space, the results can be deadly.
7.48.4.2.7.3	Because CO binds to hemoglobin with a 240-fold higher affinity than O2, it can prevent hemoglobin from transporting O2.
7.48.4.2.7.4	In the United States, up to 500 people die each year from CO poisoning.
7.48.4.3.1.1	Muscle cells have their own O2-binding molecule, myoglobin.
7.48.4.3.1.2	Myoglobin consists of just one polypeptide chain associated with an iron-containing ring structure that can bind one O2 molecule. *Myoglobin has a higher affinity for O2 than hemoglobin does, so it picks up and holds O2 at PO2 values at which hemoglobin is releasing its bound O2 (Figure 48.13).
7.48.4.3.1.3	Figure 48.13 Oxygen-Binding Adaptations
7.48.4.3.2.1	*connect the concepts The evolutionary relationships between myoglobin and the various hemoglobin subunits is shown in Figure 23.10.
7.48.4.3.3.1	Myoglobin facilitates the diffusion of O2 in muscle cells and provides an O2 reserve for times when metabolic demands are high and blood flow is interrupted.
7.48.4.3.3.2	Interruption of blood flow in muscles is common because contracting muscles squeeze blood vessels.
7.48.4.3.3.3	When tissue PO2 values are low and hemoglobin can no longer supply more O2, myoglobin releases its bound O2.
7.48.4.3.3.4	Diving mammals such as seals have high concentrations of myoglobin in their muscles, which is one reason they can stay under water for so long (Investigating Life: Seals Are Champion Breath-Hold Divers).
7.48.4.3.3.5	Even in non-diving animals, muscles called on for extended periods of work frequently have more myoglobin than do muscles that are used for short, intermittent periods, as noted in Key Concept 47.2.

7.48.4.3.7.3	Journal of Experimental Biology 165: 181   194.
7.48.4.3.8.1	Weddell seals live near the edges of the ice in Antarctica where they feed by diving in the surrounding ocean.
7.48.4.3.8.2	The ice-covered ocean presents a unique opportunity to study the diving and breathing behaviors of these seals if they have to return to the same breathing hole in the ice.
7.48.4.3.9.1	QUESTIONSHow do metabolic requirements of a freely diving seal correlate with its oxygen stores?
7.48.4.3.10.1	METHOD
7.48.4.3.11.1	Transport Weddell seals several kilometers away from the ice edge, but still on the extensive Antarctic ice sheet.
7.48.4.3.12.1	Fit the seals with distance and depth gauges to calculate the metabolic costs of individual dives.
7.48.4.3.13.1	Make a hole in the ice and release the seals so they can return to the sea through the hole.
7.48.4.3.14.1	Allow the seals to dive and feed naturally.
7.48.4.3.15.1	When seals return to the hole to breathe, measure O2 consumption and CO2 release and determine each seal&#8217;s metabolic rate (MR).
7.48.4.3.16.1	RESULTS
7.48.4.3.17.1	Most dives were only a few minutes long, but many were over 30 minutes and the longest was 82 minutes.
7.48.4.3.17.2	MR was also measured when the seals rested and slept.
7.48.4.3.17.3	Seals frequently do not breathe during sleep.
7.48.4.3.17.4	The longest sleep episode without breathing was 13.5 minutes.
7.48.4.3.17.5	Condition Mean MR (mL O2/min kg) (&#177; SD) Rest 4.1 (0.3) Sleep 3.5 (0.6) All dives 4.5 (0.9) Short dives 5.0 (0.9) Long dives 3.4 (0.6)
7.48.4.3.18.1	CONCLUSIONS
7.48.4.3.19.1	There were no significant differences in MR during rest, sleep, and the mean for all dives taken together.
7.48.4.3.19.2	The relatively consistent measurements of MR indicate a very low metabolic cost of diving and activities during the dives.
7.48.4.3.19.3	Going from resting to diving resulted in only a 10% increase in MR. (In humans, by contrast, going from resting to standing involves a 16% increase in MR.)
7.48.4.3.20.1	MRs during long dives were lower than at rest, but MRs during short dives (&lt;15 minutes) were significantly higher than during long dives, indicating the capacity of the seals to conserve O2 supplies to extend dive duration.
7.48.4.3.21.1	work with the data
7.48.4.3.22.1	How do the seal&#8217;s oxygen stores compare with its oxygen demands?
7.48.4.3.22.2	To calculate the oxygen reserves of a Weddell seal, we have to assess the amount of oxygen in its blood and in the myoglobin in its muscles at the beginning of the dive.
7.48.4.3.22.3	The amount of oxygen in its lungs is irrelevant since seals exhale before diving, so there is little oxygen available in its alveoli during the dive.
7.48.4.3.23.1	The problem requires calculating the amount of O2 in the arterial and venous blood and myoglobin at the beginning of the dive that is available to support the seal&#8217;s MR.
7.48.4.3.24.1	Assume the following:
7.48.4.3.25.1	Average body mass: 355 kg
7.48.4.3.26.1	Blood volume: 14.8% of mass (7% in humans)
7.48.4.3.27.1	Hematocrit: 58% (human averages 42%)
7.48.4.3.28.1	Hemoglobin content of red blood cells: 23.7%
7.48.4.3.29.1	O2 holding capacity of hemoglobin: 1.34 mL/g
7.48.4.3.30.1	Blood: 34% is arterial, 95% saturated at beginning of dive, can desaturate to 20%
7.48.4.3.31.1	Available O2 in arterial blood is calculated as follows:
7.48.4.3.32.1	Total arterial blood = 355 kg &#215; 0.148 &#215; 0.34 = 17.9 kg
7.48.4.3.33.1	Total arterial hemoglobin = 17.9 kg &#215; 0.58 &#215; 0.24 = 2.49 kg
7.48.4.3.34.1	Maximum O2 content = 3.34 L
7.48.4.3.35.1	Arterial O2 available = 3.34 &#215; (95%     20%) = 2.5 L
7.48.4.3.36.1	QUESTIONS
7.48.4.3.37.1	Calculate the available O2 in the venous blood.
7.48.4.3.37.2	Assume venous blood is 66% of total blood volume, and it is 90% saturated at the beginning of the dive and can desaturate to 0%.
7.48.4.3.38.1	Calculate the available O2 in myoglobin.
7.48.4.3.38.2	Assume 33% of body mass is muscle, myoglobin content of seal muscle is 45 g/kg (20   25 g/kg for humans), and O2 holding capacity of myoglobin is 1.34 mL O2/g.
7.48.4.3.39.1	What are the total O2 reserves at the beginning of the dive?
7.48.4.3.40.1	Given the MR values found in the experiment, what do you predict would be the maximum duration of no breathing during sleep?
7.48.4.3.41.1	Using the table of MR values for all dives in the results portion of the experiment, predict the maximum duration of a Weddell seal dive.
7.48.4.3.42.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.48.4.4.1.1	Various factors influence the O2-binding/dissociation properties of hemoglobin, thereby influencing O2 delivery to tissues.
7.48.4.4.1.2	Three of these factors are the chemical composition of the hemoglobin, the blood pH, and the presence of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPG) in RBCs.
7.48.4.4.1.1.1	There is more than one type of hemoglobin because the chemical composition of the polypeptide chains that form the hemoglobin molecule varies.
7.48.4.4.1.1.2	The normal hemoglobin of adult humans has two each of two kinds of polypeptide chains   two &#945;-globin chains and two &#946;-globin chains.
7.48.4.4.1.1.3	This normal adult hemoglobin has the O2-binding characteristics shown in Figure 48.13.
7.48.4.4.1.2.1	Before birth, the human fetus has a different form of hemoglobin, consisting of two &#945;-globin and two &#947;-globin chains.
7.48.4.4.1.2.2	The functional difference between fetal and adult hemoglobin is that fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for O2.
7.48.4.4.1.2.3	Therefore the fetal hemoglobin   oxygen binding/dissociation curve is shifted to the left compared with the adult curve (see Figure 48.13).
7.48.4.4.1.2.4	You can see from these curves that if both types of hemoglobin are at the same PO2 (as they are in the placenta), fetal hemoglobin will pick up O2 that the adult hemoglobin releases.
7.48.4.4.1.2.5	This difference in O2 affinities enables the efficient transfer of O2 from the mother&#8217;s blood to the fetus&#8217;s blood.
7.48.4.4.2.1.1	The O2-binding properties of hemoglobin are also influenced by physiological conditions.
7.48.4.4.2.1.2	The influence of pH on the function of hemoglobin is known as the Bohr effect.
7.48.4.4.2.1.3	As blood passes through metabolically active tissue such as exercising muscle, it picks up acidic metabolites.
7.48.4.4.2.1.4	As a result, blood pH falls.
7.48.4.4.2.1.5	The excess H&#0043; ions bind preferentially to deoxygenated hemoglobin and decrease its affinity for O2, and the O2-binding/dissociation curve of hemoglobin shifts to the right (see Figure 48.13).
7.48.4.4.2.1.6	This shift means the hemoglobin will release more O2 in tissues where pH is low   another way that O2 is supplied where and when it is most needed.
7.48.4.4.3.1.1	1,3-BPG is an intermediate in glycolosis (see p. 177), and therefore an important source of energy for cells.
7.48.4.4.3.1.2	However, 1,3-BPG can be converted to 2,3-BPG by an enzyme in the RBC. 2,3-BPG is an important regulator of hemoglobin function.
7.48.4.4.3.1.3	Like excess H&#0043;, 2,3-BPG reversibly combines with deoxygenated hemoglobin and lowers its affinity for O2.
7.48.4.4.3.1.4	The result is that at any PO2, hemoglobin releases more of its bound O2 than it otherwise would.
7.48.4.4.3.1.5	In other words, 2,3-BPG shifts the O2-binding/dissociation curve of mammalian hemoglobin to the right.
7.48.4.4.3.2.1	When humans go to high altitudes, or when they cease being sedentary and begin to exercise, the level of 2,3-BPG in their RBCs goes up, making it easier for hemoglobin to deliver more O2 to tissues.
7.48.4.4.3.2.2	During pregnancy, a woman has about a 30 percent increase in 2,3-BPG, which makes more O2 available in the placenta to be picked up by the fetal hemoglobin.
7.48.4.4.3.2.3	In addition, fetal hemoglobin has a left-shifted O2-binding/dissociation curve because its &#947;-globin chains have a lower affinity for 2,3-BPG than do the &#946;-globin chains of adult hemoglobin.
7.48.4.5.1.1	Delivering O2 to tissues is only half the respiratory function of blood.
7.48.4.5.1.2	Blood also carries CO2, a metabolic waste product, away from tissues (Figure 48.14).
7.48.4.5.1.3	CO2 is highly soluble and readily diffuses through cell membranes, moving from its site of production in the tissues into the blood, where PCO2 is lower.
7.48.4.5.1.4	However, only about 5 percent of the CO2 carried by the blood is dissolved CO2.
7.48.4.5.1.5	About 20 percent of the CO2 carried to the lungs in the blood is in chemical combination with hemoglobin.
7.48.4.5.1.6	And most CO2 produced by the tissues is transported to the lungs in the form of bicarbonate ions (HCO3   ).
7.48.4.5.1.7	CO2 diffusing from cells is converted to HCO3   , transported to the lungs, and then converted back to CO2 to be exhaled.
7.48.4.5.1.8	Figure 48.14 Carbon Dioxide Is Transported as Bicarbonate Ions
7.48.4.5.2.1	When CO2 dissolves in water, some of it slowly reacts with the water molecules to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), some of which then dissociates into a proton (H&#0043;) and a bicarbonate ion (HCO3   ).
7.48.4.5.2.2	This reversible reaction is expressed as follows:
7.48.4.5.3.1	CO2 + H2O &#8764; H2CO3 &#8764; H&#0043; + HCO3
7.48.4.5.4.1	In the extracellular fluid, the reaction between CO2 and H2O proceeds slowly.
7.48.4.5.4.2	But it is a different story in the endothelial cells of the capillaries and in the RBCs, where the enzyme carbonic anhydrase speeds up the conversion of CO2 to H2CO3.
7.48.4.5.4.3	The newly formed H2CO3 dissociates, and the resulting bicarbonate ions enter the plasma in exchange for Cl    (see Figure 48.14).
7.48.4.5.4.4	By converting CO2 to H2CO3, carbonic anhydrase reduces the PCO2 in these cells and in the plasma, facilitating the diffusion of CO2 from tissue cells to endothelial cells, plasma, and RBCs.
7.48.4.5.5.1	In the lungs, the reactions involving CO2 and bicarbonate ions are reversed.
7.48.4.5.5.2	Remember that an enzyme such as carbonic anhydrase only speeds up a reversible reaction; it does not determine its direction.
7.48.4.5.5.3	The direction is determined by concentrations of reactants and products.
7.48.4.5.5.4	Ventilation keeps the PCO2 in the alveoli low, so CO2 diffuses from the blood plasma into the alveoli, lowering the PCO2 in the blood, which favors the conversion of HCO3    into CO2.
7.48.4.5.5.5	Also, the oxygenation of hemoglobin in the alveoli decreases its affinity for CO2, a phenomenon known as the Haldane effect.
7.48.4.5.6.1	48.4 recap
7.48.4.5.7.1	O2 is transported from the lungs to the body&#8217;s tissues in reversible combination with hemoglobin.
7.48.4.5.7.2	Each hemoglobin molecule can reversibly combine with four O2 molecules; the percent saturation of the binding sites is a function of the PO2 in the hemoglobin&#8217;s environment.
7.48.4.5.7.3	The hemoglobin   oxygen binding/dissociation curve is shifted by the concentration of H&#0043; and the level of 2,3-BPG in the blood.
7.48.4.5.7.4	CO2 is transported by the blood mostly in the form of HCO3   .
7.48.4.5.8.1	learning outcomes
7.48.4.5.9.1	You should be able to:
7.48.4.5.10.1	Explain the adaptive advantage of hemoglobin remaining 75 percent saturated with O2 in mixed venous blood.
7.48.4.5.11.1	Explain how 2,3-BPG and pH alter the O2 binding properties of hemoglobin, and discuss the functional significance of these changes.
7.48.4.5.12.1	Explain how the same enzyme, carbonic anhydrase, catalyzes both the loading of CO2 from cells to the blood and the off-loading of CO2 from the blood to the alveoli.
7.48.4.5.13.1	The PO2 of atmospheric air at sea level is about 159 mm Hg.
7.48.4.5.13.2	What is the functional significance of the fact that human hemoglobin fully saturates with O2 at a PO2 of 100 mm Hg and returns to the heart in venous blood with a PO2 of about 40 mm Hg, reflecting 75 percent saturation?
7.48.4.5.14.1	When red blood cells are stored in the blood bank, they will eventually use their 1,3-BPG for energy.
7.48.4.5.14.2	What will be the consequence for their ability to function after transfusion into a patient?
7.48.4.5.15.1	Why do HCO3    ions leave the red blood cells in systemic venous blood but enter red blood cells in the alveolar circulation?
7.48.4.5.16.1	We must breathe every minute of our lives, but most of us usually don&#8217;t worry about it, or even think about it very often.
7.48.4.5.16.2	In the next section we will examine how the regular breathing cycle is generated and controlled by the central nervous system.
7.48.4.5.17.1	Chapter 48 continues with
7.48.4.5.18.1	48.5 Breathing Is Homeostatically Regulated
7.48.5.1.1	Breathing is controlled in the brainstem
7.48.5.2.1	Regulating breathing requires feedback
7.48.5.3.1	Breathing is an involuntary function of the central nervous system (CNS).
7.48.5.3.2	The breathing pattern is adjusted around other activities (such as speech and eating), and breathing rates change to match the metabolic demands of the body.
7.48.5.3.3	How is this accomplished?
7.48.5.4.1	focus your learning
7.48.5.5.1	The breathing pattern of inhalation followed by exhalation is controlled by a neural circuit in the brainstem.
7.48.5.6.1	Breathing is regulated by feedback mechanisms involving CO2 sensitive cells in the brain and O2 sensitive cells in the great arteries.
7.48.5.7.1	Brain chemosensitive cells sense CO2 levels through changes in hydrogen ion concentration, whereas nodes in the aorta and the carotid arteries are sensitive to blood O2 levels.
7.48.5.8.1	The basic breathing rhythm is an involuntary function that is modified by feedback information that conveys the body&#8217;s need for an adequate O2 supply and CO2 elimination.
7.48.5.1.1.1	Breathing is driven by a rhythm-generating neural circuit in the brainstem, but where?
7.48.5.1.1.2	Breathing ceases if the spinal cord is severed in the neck region, showing that breathing is generated in the brain.
7.48.5.1.1.3	If the brainstem is cut just above the pons, breathing is normal.
7.48.5.1.1.4	If the brainstem is cut between the pons and the medulla (the segment of the brainstem just above the spinal cord), the breathing pattern becomes irregular (Figure 48.15).
7.48.5.1.1.5	Electrophysiological recordings reveal a group of respiratory motor neurons in the dorsal medulla that increase their firing rates just before an inhalation begins.
7.48.5.1.1.6	The axons of these neurons leave the CNS in the neck region to form the phrenic nerve, which innervates the diaphragm.
7.48.5.1.1.7	As more and more of these neurons fire   and fire faster and faster   the diaphragm contracts.
7.48.5.1.1.8	All of a sudden the neurons stop firing, the diaphragm relaxes, and exhalation begins.
7.48.5.1.1.9	Exhalation is usually a passive process that depends on the elastic recoil of the lung tissues.
7.48.5.1.1.10	Another group of respiratory motor neurons is found in the ventral medulla that becomes active when breathing demand is high.
7.48.5.1.1.11	These motor neurons communicate through thoracic spinal nerves to the intercostal muscles.
7.48.5.1.1.12	By expanding and contracting the rib cage, the intercostal muscles increase both the inhalation and the exhalation volumes.
7.48.5.1.1.13	Figure 48.15 Breathing Is Controlled in the Brainstem
7.48.5.1.2.1	Neurons in the lower region of the pons help regularize the basic respiratory rhythm.
7.48.5.1.2.2	Still higher brain areas modify breathing to accommodate speech, ingestion of food, coughing, and emotional states.
7.48.5.2.1.1	When breathing or metabolism changes, the PO2 and PCO2 in the blood change as well.
7.48.5.2.1.2	It is reasonable to surmise that the blood levels of one or both of these gases provide feedback information to the breathing rhythm generator in the medulla.
7.48.5.2.1.3	Humans and other mammals are remarkably insensitive to falling levels of O2 in arterial blood but are extremely sensitive to increases in CO2.
7.48.5.2.1.4	That is, arterial PO2 can deviate considerably from normal without causing much of an increase in ventilation rate, but even a small rise in arterial PCO2 causes a large increase in ventilation (Figure 48.16).
7.48.5.2.1.5	This relationship is reversed for water-breathing animals, in which O2 is the primary feedback stimulus for gill ventilation.
7.48.5.2.1.6	Figure 48.16 Carbon Dioxide Affects Breathing Rate
7.48.5.2.2.1	The lack of O2 sensitivity in humans was tragically demonstrated by an accident at the Kennedy Space Center in 1981 prior to the first flight of the Space Shuttle Program.
7.48.5.2.2.2	The space shuttle Columbia was being prepared for launch, and to reduce the danger of fire, the engine compartment was purged with nitrogen and sealed.
7.48.5.2.2.3	Unaware of the nitrogen, workers opened a hatch to the compartment for inspection.
7.48.5.2.2.4	The first worker to enter became unconscious, and others followed him in a rescue attempt.
7.48.5.2.2.5	Three of these workers died, and two others who were stricken recovered.
7.48.5.2.2.6	When exposed to lack of oxygen, there is no alerting, emergency response   there is simply loss of consciousness.
7.48.5.2.3.1	Where are partial pressures of gases in the blood sensed?
7.48.5.2.3.2	The major site of PCO2 sensitivity is an area on the ventral surface of the medulla.
7.48.5.2.3.3	The primary sensitivity of these chemosensitive cells is not, however, to CO2.
7.48.5.2.3.4	It is H&#0043; ions that stimulate these cells.
7.48.5.2.3.5	The H&#0043; ion concentration in the environment of these cells is a direct reflection of the PCO2 of the blood.
7.48.5.2.3.6	When the PCO2 of the blood is higher than that of the extracellular fluid in this area, CO2 diffuses out of the blood.
7.48.5.2.3.7	This CO2 interacts with H2O in the plasma to form carbonic acid (H2CO3), which dissociates into H&#0043; ions and HCO3    ions (see Figure 48.14, which describes this same reaction in the RBCs).
7.48.5.2.3.8	It is the H&#0043; ions produced by the dissociation of carbonic acid that stimulate the chemosensitive cells that increase respiratory gas exchange.
7.48.5.2.3.9	Thus even though we measure blood PCO2 as the stimulus for breathing, the major stimulus is an increase in H&#0043; ion concentration (lowered pH).
7.48.5.2.4.1	We do have some physiological sensitivity to blood PO2 in nodes of neural tissue on the large blood vessels leaving the heart: the aorta and the carotid arteries (Figure 48.17).
7.48.5.2.4.2	These carotid bodies and aortic bodies are chemosensors.
7.48.5.2.4.3	If the blood supply to these structures decreases, or if the blood PO2 falls dramatically, the chemosensors are activated and send nerve impulses to the breathing control center.
7.48.5.2.4.4	Although we are not very sensitive to changes in blood PO2, the carotid and aortic bodies can stimulate increases in breathing during exposure to high altitudes or when blood volume or blood pressure is very low.
7.48.5.2.4.5	Also, there is a synergism between CO2 and O2 sensing.
7.48.5.2.4.6	When blood PCO2 increases, there is an increased sensitivity to low O2, and vice versa.

7.48.5.2.5.1	48.5 recap
7.48.5.2.6.1	The rhythmic contractions of the respiratory muscles that drive breathing are generated by neurons in the brainstem.
7.48.5.2.6.2	Breathing is regulated predominantly in response to the PCO2 of the blood.
7.48.5.2.6.3	Respiratory chemosensors are cells on the ventral surface of the medulla that are sensitive to the blood PCO2, and the carotid and aortic bodies on the large arteries leaving the heart that are sensitive to the blood PO2 or to a decrease in the blood they are receiving.
7.48.5.2.7.1	learning outcomes
7.48.5.2.8.1	You should be able to:
7.48.5.2.9.1	Explain the roles of the dorsal and ventral groups of respiratory neurons in the medulla.
7.48.5.2.10.1	Apply knowledge about the physiological processes underlying breathing to explain the body&#8217;s response to intense exercise and to decreases in PO2.
7.48.5.2.11.1	Describe where chemosensitive cells are located and how they participate in negative feedback control of breathing.
7.48.5.2.12.1	In terms of respiratory motor neurons and respiratory muscle groups, what changes occur in transitioning from breathing at rest to breathing that uses more of the lung&#8217;s vital capacity?
7.48.5.2.13.1	When you go rapidly to high altitude, you may experience a breathing pattern in which periods of no breathing alternate with periods of fast breathing.
7.48.5.2.13.2	Explain that response in terms of diffusion gradients for O2 and CO2 and the feedback signals regulating breathing.
7.48.5.2.14.1	Cells in the carotid and aortic bodies have high metabolic rates, and they are sensitive either to a decrease in blood flow or to a decrease in the PO2 of the blood.
7.48.5.2.14.2	How are these two facts related?
7.48.5.2.15.1	investigatinglife
7.48.5.2.16.1	What adaptations make seals champion breath-hold divers?
7.48.5.2.17.1	Seals have remarkable abilities to dive deep and long and to spend only minutes at the surface to breathe between dives.
7.48.5.2.17.2	In the chapter opener about elephant seals, we posed several questions that apply to all seals: Why aren&#8217;t seals crushed by the water pressure at extreme depths?
7.48.5.2.17.3	Why don&#8217;t they get the bends?
7.48.5.2.17.4	What are their O2 demands?
7.48.5.2.17.5	And what are their O2 reserves?
7.48.5.2.17.6	The answers to the first two questions are related.
7.48.5.2.17.7	Only air-filled structures of the body are compressible, and the seals exhale at the beginning of a dive.
7.48.5.2.17.8	Their residual volume is restricted to their airways, where gas exchanges do not occur.
7.48.5.2.17.9	Thus the high pressure of the small amount of gas in their respiratory system does not drive dissolved nitrogen into their tissues.
7.48.5.2.17.10	Investigating Life: Seals Are Champion Breath-Hold Divers presented metabolic rate (MR) measurements for Weddell seals resting, sleeping, and diving.
7.48.5.2.17.11	No significant differences in MR for various activities were observed, leading to the conclusion that the metabolic costs of diving are quite modest.
7.48.5.2.17.12	In fact, MRs during dives were only about 10 percent higher than at rest   not much different than for humans going from sitting to standing.
7.48.5.2.18.1	How is seal activity supported by such a low metabolic expenditure?
7.48.5.2.18.2	And given those low MRs, how do seals maintain O2 reserves sufficient to support them during dives?
7.48.5.2.18.3	The calculations made in the work with the data exercise in Investigating Life: Seals Are Champion Breath-Hold Divers showed that the O2 reserve of a sleeping seal would permit it to not breathe for a maximum of 12.8 minutes, which corresponds well with the maximum episode of sleep observed   13.5 minutes.
7.48.5.2.18.4	Using the MR value for all dives, calculations show that the seals&#8217; O2 reserves would only support dives that were under 10 minutes in duration.
7.48.5.2.18.5	This means that additional adaptations enable the seal to remain active underwater for long periods at an average MR similar to what they experience during sleep.
7.48.5.2.19.1	Future directions
7.48.5.2.20.1	Recording devices attached to seals diving in nature reveal adaptations that minimize their O2 demands during a dive.
7.48.5.2.20.2	Because they exhale at the beginning of a dive, they are negatively buoyant, meaning they can drift down to depths like a falling leaf.
7.48.5.2.20.3	These recordings also answered another question.
7.48.5.2.20.4	Since the seals at sea dive continually day and night, when do they sleep?
7.48.5.2.20.5	They spend much of their passive descent time sleeping, thus lowering their MR even more.
7.48.5.2.20.6	Yet more metabolic savings are needed to enable long dives.
7.48.5.2.20.7	One clue comes from measures of the seals&#8217; heart rates during dives.
7.48.5.2.20.8	Their heart rates are very much reduced, a phenomenon called diving bradycardia.
7.48.5.2.20.9	We will discuss diving bradycardia in the next chapter and see how it relates to seals&#8217; ability to drastically lower their MR while diving.

7.48.5.2.22.1	48 Chapter Summary
7.48.summary.1.1	48.1 Respiratory Gas Exchange Is Governed by Physical Factors
7.48.summary.2.1	Most cells require a constant supply of O2 and continuous removal of CO2.
7.48.summary.2.2	These respiratory gases are exchanged between an animal&#8217;s body fluids and its environment by diffusion.
7.48.summary.3.1	Fick&#8217;s law of diffusion shows how various physical factors influence the diffusion rate of gases.
7.48.summary.3.2	Adaptations to maximize respiratory gas exchange influence one or more variables of Fick&#8217;s law.
7.48.summary.4.1	In water-breathing animals, gas exchange is limited by the low diffusion rate and low amount of O2 in water.
7.48.summary.4.2	If water temperature rises, water-breathing animals face a double bind: while O2 in water decreases, the amount of work required to move water over the gas exchange surfaces increases.
7.48.summary.4.3	Review Figure 48.2
7.48.summary.5.1	In air, O2 partial pressure (PO2) decreases with increasing altitude.
7.48.summary.6.1	48.2 Enhancing Diffusion Maximizes Respiratory Gas Exchange
7.48.summary.7.1	Adaptations to maximize gas exchange include increasing the surface area for gas exchange and maximizing partial pressure gradients across those exchange surfaces.
7.48.summary.7.2	Partial pressure gradients are established both by ventilating the outer surface with the respiratory medium, and perfusing the inner surface with blood.
7.48.summary.8.1	External and internal gills are adaptations for gas exchange with water.
7.48.summary.8.2	Lungs and tracheae are adaptations for gas exchange with air.
7.48.summary.8.3	Review Figures 48.3, 48.4
7.48.summary.9.1	The gills of fish have large gas exchange surface areas that are ventilated continuously and unidirectionally with water.
7.48.summary.9.2	The countercurrent flow of blood helps increase the efficiency of gas exchange.
7.48.summary.9.3	Review Figures 48.5, 48.6
7.48.summary.10.1	The gas exchange system of birds includes air sacs that communicate with the lungs but are not used for gas exchange.
7.48.summary.10.2	Air flows unidirectionally through bird lungs; gases are exchanged in air capillaries that run between parabronchi.
7.48.summary.10.3	Review Figure 48.7
7.48.summary.11.1	Each breath of air remains in a bird&#8217;s respiratory system for two breathing cycles.
7.48.summary.11.2	The air sacs work as bellows to supply the air capillaries with a continuous unidirectional flow of fresh air.
7.48.summary.11.3	Review Figure 48.8, Animation 48.1
7.48.summary.12.1	In all air-breathing vertebrates except birds, breathing is tidal.
7.48.summary.12.2	Although the volume of air exchanged with each breath can vary considerably in tidal breathing, the inhaled air is always mixed with stale air.
7.48.summary.12.3	Review Figure 48.9
7.48.summary.13.1	48.3 Humans Have Tidal Respiration
7.48.summary.14.1	In mammalian lungs, the gas exchange surface area provided by the millions of alveoli is enormous, and the diffusion path length between the air and perfusing blood is short.
7.48.summary.14.2	Surface tension in the alveoli would make inflation of the lungs difficult if the alveoli did not produce surfactant.
7.48.summary.14.3	Review Focus: Key Figure 48.10, Activity 48.1
7.48.summary.15.1	Inhalation occurs when contractions of the diaphragm increase volume and reduce pressure in the thoracic cavity, thereby pulling on the pleural membranes.
7.48.summary.15.2	Relaxation of the diaphragm increases pressure in the thoracic cavity and results in exhalation.
7.48.summary.15.3	Review Figure 48.11, Animation 48.2
7.48.summary.16.1	During periods of heavy metabolic demands such as strenuous exercise, the intercostal muscles, located between the ribs, increase the volume of air inhaled and exhaled.
7.48.summary.17.1	48.4 Respiratory Gases Are Transported by the Blood
7.48.summary.18.1	O2 is reversibly bound to hemoglobin in red blood cells.
7.48.summary.18.2	Each hemoglobin molecule can carry a maximum of four O2 molecules.
7.48.summary.18.3	Because of positive cooperativity, hemoglobin&#8217;s affinity for O2 depends on the PO2 to which the hemoglobin is exposed.
7.48.summary.18.4	Therefore hemoglobin picks up O2 as it flows through respiratory exchange structures and gives up O2 in metabolically active tissues.
7.48.summary.18.5	Review Figure 48.12, Activity 48.2
7.48.summary.19.1	Myoglobin serves as an O2 reserve in muscle.
7.48.summary.20.1	There is more than one type of hemoglobin.
7.48.summary.20.2	Fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for O2 than does adult hemoglobin, allowing fetal blood to pick up O2 from the maternal blood in the placenta.
7.48.summary.20.3	Review Figure 48.13, Activity 48.3
7.48.summary.21.1	CO2 is transported in the blood principally as bicarbonate ions (HCO3   ).
7.48.summary.21.2	Review Figure 48.14
7.48.summary.22.1	48.5 Breathing Is Homeostatically Regulated
7.48.summary.23.1	The basic breathing rhythm is an involuntary function generated by neurons in the medulla and modulated by higher brain centers.
7.48.summary.23.2	The most important feedback stimulus for breathing is the level of CO2 in the blood.
7.48.summary.23.3	Review Figures 48.15, 48.16
7.48.summary.24.1	The breathing rhythm is sensitive to feedback from chemosensors on the ventral surface of the medulla and in the carotid and aortic bodies on the large vessels leaving the heart.

7.48.summary.32.3	Nature 433: 516   519.
7.48.summary.33.1	Insects&#8217; air-delivery system consists of tracheae that branch throughout the body, facilitating the exchange of O2 and CO2 in and out of tissues.
7.48.summary.33.2	The finest of these tubes are less than a micrometer in diameter.
7.48.summary.33.3	Tracheal openings on the body&#8217;s surface are guarded by valve-like spiracles that can be opened, closed, or &#8220;fluttered. &#8221;
7.48.summary.34.1	To study tracheal function, microscopic plastic tubes were surgically inserted into the tracheae of the pupal stages of Attacus atlas moths.
7.48.summary.34.2	The microtubes were attached to sensors that recorded the rate of CO2 released from the tracheae and the intratracheal concentrations of O2.
7.48.summary.34.3	Pupae were placed in chambers with normal atmospheric levels of gases, and the spiracle behavior, rate of CO2 release, and O2 concentrations in the tracheae were recorded (Figure A).
7.48.summary.34.4	Kilopascals (kPa) was the measure of gas pressure.
7.48.summary.34.5	Figure A
7.48.summary.35.1	To test how the spiracles performed in differing atmospheric conditions and what effects this might have on the rate of CO2 release and O2 concentrations, researchers exposed pupae to differing levels of atmospheric O2 (labeled red line in graphs).
7.48.summary.35.2	They then measured levels of CO2 release and O2 concentrations during the fluttering stage (Figure B).

7.49.1.1	Fabrice Muamba (on the right) was a lucky survivor of cardiac arrest caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the most common cause of death among young athletes.
7.49.1.2	What causes this condition, and can it be prevented or treated?
7.49.2.1	Key Concepts:
7.49.3.1	Circulatory Systems Serve Many Functions
7.49.4.1	Vertebrate Circulatory Systems Evolved from Single to Double Circuits
7.49.5.1	Heart Function Depends on Properties of Cardiac Muscle
7.49.6.1	Circulatory System Functions Depend on Blood and Blood Vessels
7.49.7.1	The Circulation Is Controlled by Hormonal and Neural Signals
7.49.8.1	investigatinglife
7.49.9.1	Athletes with Big Hearts
7.49.10.1	Fabrice Muamba was a much-loved and admired professional soccer player.
7.49.10.2	On March 17, 2012, during a championship quarterfinal match, 23-year-old Fabrice suddenly collapsed on the field.
7.49.10.3	He was immediately attended to by team physicians and a cardiologist who happened to be a spectator at the match.
7.49.10.4	Fabrice received numerous defibrillator shocks, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and was rushed to a hospital, but still his heart stopped for 78 minutes.
7.49.10.5	Remarkably he survived, but there is a long list of young, fit athletes who have died from cardiac arrest during physical exertion.
7.49.10.6	Sudden cardiac arrest is the most common cause of death for athletes.
7.49.10.7	In most cases the cause is not a heart attack, but a condition known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).
7.49.11.1	Your heart is a muscular pump.
7.49.11.2	At rest it beats an average of 60   70 times per minute.
7.49.11.3	With each beat, it circulates about 70 milliliters of blood through your body.
7.49.11.4	Without adding the increases due to work or exercise, that is 300 liters per hour, 7,200 liters per day, 2.6 million liters per year   no time-outs.
7.49.12.1	Heart failure is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for some one-fourth (about 600,000) of the deaths each year.
7.49.12.2	Heart failure most commonly results from blockage of the blood vessels that supply the heart muscle with blood, and its risk increases with age.
7.49.12.3	The most common cause of heart failure in athletes is not blocked vessels but gene mutations that affect the contractile proteins of the heart.
7.49.12.4	About 1,000 such mutations have been identified, and they exist in about 1 in 500 people.
7.49.12.5	Most people with one of these mutations live normally, so why are they so dangerous in athletes?
7.49.12.6	The mutations decrease the efficiency of the contractions of the heart muscle, so the heart has to work much harder.
7.49.12.7	Especially in athletes, the heart gets bigger to compensate for its inefficiency.
7.49.12.8	The walls of the heart can get so thick that they impede the blood from leaving the heart, and the thick walls can interfere with the signals that coordinate the contractions of the heart muscle.
7.49.12.9	The result is cardiac arrest.
7.49.12.10	Assessment of HCM risk is improving, and many afflicted athletes are choosing to retire rather than taking a chance of dying from cardiac arrest.
7.49.13.1	Are there potential therapies that could treat HCM?

7.49.15.1	49.1 Circulatory Systems Serve Many Functions
7.49.1.1.1	Some animals do not have a circulatory system
7.49.1.2.1	Circulatory systems can be open or closed
7.49.1.3.1	Open circulatory systems move extracellular fluid
7.49.1.4.1	Closed circulatory systems circulate blood through a system of blood vessels
7.49.1.5.1	A circulatory system consists of a muscular pump (the heart), a fluid (blood), and a series of conduits (blood vessels) through which the fluid can be pumped throughout the body.
7.49.1.5.2	Heart, blood, and vessels are also known collectively as a cardiovascular system (Greek kardia, &#8220;heart,&#8221; + Latin vasculum, &#8220;vessel&#8221;).
7.49.1.5.3	The function of a circulatory system is to transport things around the body.
7.49.1.5.4	Preceding chapters discussed how circulatory systems transport heat, hormones, respiratory gases, blood cells, platelets, and cells and molecules of the immune system.
7.49.1.5.5	Succeeding chapters will add nutrients and waste products to that list.
7.49.1.5.6	In this section we will describe the general types of circulatory systems found in animals.
7.49.1.6.1	focus your learning
7.49.1.7.1	A circulatory system functions to transport materials around the body.
7.49.1.8.1	Small or thin aquatic organisms may not have circulatory systems, and the needs of their cells are served by direct exchange with the environment.
7.49.1.9.1	Circulatory systems use a muscular heart to distribute extracellular fluid throughout the body to transport nutrients, respiratory gases, wastes, and other materials.
7.49.1.10.1	Closed circulatory systems allow more rapid flow and differential control of blood flow to different tissues.
7.49.1.1.1.1	Single-celled organisms serve all of their needs through direct exchanges with the environment.
7.49.1.1.1.2	Such organisms are found mostly in aquatic or very moist terrestrial environments.
7.49.1.1.1.3	Similarly, many multicellular aquatic organisms are small or thin enough that all of their cells are close to the external environment.
7.49.1.1.1.4	Such species may not have a circulatory system because nutrients, respiratory gases, and wastes can diffuse directly between the cells of their bodies and the environment.
7.49.1.1.2.1	The cells of some larger aquatic multicellular animals without a circulatory system are served by highly branched central cavities called gastrovascular systems that bring the external environment into the animal.
7.49.1.1.2.2	All the cells of a sponge are in contact with, or very close to, the water that surrounds the animal and circulates through its central cavity (see Figure 48.1B).
7.49.1.1.2.3	Very small animals without a circulatory system can maintain high levels of metabolic activity, but larger animals without a circulatory system such as sponges, jellyfishes, and flatworms tend to be inactive, slow, or even sedentary.
7.49.1.1.2.4	Large, active animals require circulatory systems.
7.49.1.2.1.1	The cells of large, mobile animals are supported by extracellular fluid.
7.49.1.2.1.2	All requirements of cells   oxygen, fuel, nutrients, essential molecules   come from that fluid, and the waste products of cell metabolism go into it.
7.49.1.2.1.3	Circulatory systems have muscular chambers, or hearts, that move the extracellular fluid through the body.
7.49.1.2.1.4	In open circulatory systems, extracellular fluid is the same as the fluid in the circulatory system and is called hemolymph.
7.49.1.2.1.5	This fluid leaves the vessels of the circulatory system, percolates between cells and through tissues, and then flows back into the heart or vessels of the circulatory system to be pumped out again.
7.49.1.2.1.6	In contrast, closed circulatory systems completely contain the circulating fluid (blood) in a continuous system of vessels.
7.49.1.2.1.7	Blood cells and large molecules stay within the system, but water and low-molecular-weight solutes leak out of the smallest vessels, the capillaries, which are highly permeable.
7.49.1.2.2.1	In animals with a closed circulatory system, extracellular fluid refers to both the fluid in the circulatory system and the fluid outside it.
7.49.1.2.2.2	The fluid in the circulatory system is the blood plasma; the *extracellular fluid outside the circulatory system is the interstitial fluid.
7.49.1.2.2.3	A 70-kilogram person has a total extracellular fluid volume of about 14 liters.
7.49.1.2.2.4	Less than a quarter of it   about 3 liters   is the blood plasma.
7.49.1.2.3.1	*connect the concepts Key Concept 39.2 and Figure 39.4 describe the different extracellular fluid compartments that constitute the internal environment that supports all of the metabolic needs of the cells of the body.
7.49.1.3.1.1	Figure 49.1 Circulatory Systems
7.49.1.3.2.1	Open circulatory systems are found in arthropods, mollusks, and some other invertebrate groups.
7.49.1.3.2.2	In these systems a heart moves the hemolymph through vessels leading to different regions of the body.
7.49.1.3.2.3	The fluid leaves the vessels to filter through the tissues before returning to the heart.
7.49.1.3.2.4	In the arthropod shown in Figure 49.1A, the fluid returns directly to the heart through openings called ostia.
7.49.1.3.2.5	Ostia have valves that allow hemolymph to enter the relaxed heart but prevent it from flowing in the reverse direction when the heart contracts.
7.49.1.3.2.6	In a mollusk such as a clam, open vessels collect hemolymph from different regions of the body and return it to the heart (Figure 49.1B).
7.49.1.3.3.1	Lest you think that open circulatory systems are inefficient and can support only sluggish lifestyles such as those of mollusks, remember that crabs scuttling along the beach, yellow jackets buzzing around your picnic, and scorpions dashing across the desert all have open circulatory systems.
7.49.1.4.1.1	In closed circulatory systems, blood vessels separate blood from interstitial fluid.
7.49.1.4.1.2	Blood is pumped through this vascular system by one or more hearts, and cellular and macromolecular components of the blood never leave the vessels.
7.49.1.4.1.3	Closed circulatory systems characterize vertebrates and some invertebrate groups, among them annelids.
7.49.1.4.2.1	A simple example of a closed circulatory system is that of the earthworm (Figure 49.1C).
7.49.1.4.2.2	One large ventral blood vessel carries blood from the worm&#8217;s anterior end to its posterior end.
7.49.1.4.2.3	Smaller vessels branch off and transport the blood to even smaller vessels serving the tissues in each body segment.
7.49.1.4.2.4	In the smallest vessels, respiratory gases, nutrients, and metabolic wastes diffuse between the blood and interstitial fluid.
7.49.1.4.2.5	The blood then flows from these vessels into larger vessels that lead into one large dorsal vessel that carries the blood from the posterior to the anterior end of the body.
7.49.1.4.2.6	Five pairs of muscular vessels connect the large dorsal and ventral vessels in the anterior end, thus completing the circuit.
7.49.1.4.2.7	The dorsal vessel and the five connecting vessels serve as hearts for the earthworm; their contractions keep the blood circulating.
7.49.1.4.2.8	The direction of circulation is determined by one-way valves in the dorsal vessel.
7.49.1.4.3.1	Closed circulatory systems have several advantages compared with open systems:
7.49.1.4.4.1	Fluid can flow more rapidly through vessels than through intercellular spaces and can therefore transport things to and from tissues more rapidly.
7.49.1.4.5.1	By changing the diameter (and hence the resistance) of specific vessels, closed systems can control the flow of blood to selective tissues and organs to match their needs.
7.49.1.4.6.1	Specialized cells and large molecules that aid in transporting hormones, nutrients, and oxygen can be kept in the vessels but can drop their cargo in the tissues where it is needed.
7.49.1.4.7.1	With all of these &#8220;advantages&#8221; of closed circulatory systems, you might wonder how some species with open circulatory systems can sustain such high levels of activity.
7.49.1.4.7.2	In the case of insects, the answer is clear: insects do not depend on their circulatory systems for respiratory gas exchange (see Figure 48.4).
7.49.1.4.8.1	49.1 recap
7.49.1.4.9.1	Circulatory systems consist of a pump and an open or closed set of vessels through which a fluid transports oxygen, nutrients, wastes, and a variety of other substances.
7.49.1.4.9.2	Flow to and from tissues in closed systems of vessels can be more rapid and can be directed to specific tissues according to their needs.

7.49.1.4.20.1	Our overview of the open and closed systems found among invertebrates introduced some basic concepts about circulatory systems.
7.49.1.4.20.2	Next we will turn to describing the closed circulatory systems of vertebrates.
7.49.1.4.21.1	Chapter 49 continues with
7.49.1.4.22.1	49.2 Vertebrate Circulatory Systems Evolved from Single to Double Circuits
7.49.2.1.1	Circulation in fishes is a single circuit
7.49.2.2.1	Lungfishes evolved a gas-breathing organ
7.49.2.3.1	Amphibians have partial separation of systemic and pulmonary circulation
7.49.2.4.1	Reptiles have exquisite control of pulmonary and systemic circulation
7.49.2.5.1	Birds and mammals have fully separated pulmonary and systemic circuits
7.49.2.6.1	Vertebrates have a closed circulatory system and a heart with two or more chambers.
7.49.2.6.2	When a heart chamber contracts, it squeezes the blood, putting it under pressure.
7.49.2.6.3	Blood then flows out of the heart and into vessels, where pressure is lower.
7.49.2.6.4	Resistance to flow in the vessels dissipates the pressure imparted to the blood by the heart.
7.49.2.6.5	One-way valves prevent backflow of blood as the heart cycles between contraction and relaxation.
7.49.2.6.6	Comparisons of the circulatory systems of different vertebrates reveals that as circulatory systems become more complex, the blood that flows to the gas exchange organs (gills or lungs; see Figure 48.3) becomes increasingly separated from the blood that flows to the rest of the body.
7.49.2.7.1	focus your learning
7.49.2.8.1	The circulatory system in fishes is organized as a single circuit in which blood is pumped by a four-chambered heart through the gills and then to the other organs of the body.
7.49.2.9.1	The lungfish is a transitional form in the evolution of a single blood-flow circuit into separate pulmonary and systemic circuits in other vertebrates.
7.49.2.10.1	Ectothermic reptiles have the ability to control blood flow to the pulmonary circuit, enabling them to conserve energy when they are not breathing.
7.49.2.11.1	Separation of pulmonary and systemic circulations maximizes oxygen transport to body cells and gas exchange in respiratory tissues, and allows the two circuits to operate at different pressures.
7.49.2.12.1	In fishes, the phylogenetically oldest vertebrates, blood is pumped from the heart to the gills and then to the tissues of the body and back to the heart   a single circuit.
7.49.2.12.2	In birds and mammals, blood is pumped from the heart to the lungs and back to the heart in a pulmonary circuit, and then from the heart to the rest of the body and back to the heart in a systemic circuit.
7.49.2.12.3	In amphibians and ectothermic reptiles we see various adaptations that incompletely separate the blood flow into pulmonary and systemic circuits.
7.49.2.13.1	Both pulmonary and systemic circuits begin with vessels called arteries that carry blood away from the heart.
7.49.2.13.2	Arteries branch into smaller arterioles that feed blood into capillary beds.
7.49.2.13.3	Capillaries are tiny, thin-walled vessels where materials are exchanged between blood and the interstitial fluid.
7.49.2.13.4	Small vessels called venules drain capillary beds.
7.49.2.13.5	The venules join to form the larger veins that ultimately deliver blood back to the heart.
7.49.2.14.1	We can trace the evolutionary history of vertebrate circulatory systems by comparing the circulatory systems of fishes, lungfishes, amphibians, reptiles (including crocodilians), and mammals.
7.49.2.1.1.1	The fish heart has four chambers that are connected in series.
7.49.2.1.1.2	Blood returning from all parts of the body collects in a sinus venosus that feeds into the muscular atrium.
7.49.2.1.1.3	The atrium pumps blood into the more muscular chamber, the ventricle.
7.49.2.1.1.4	Contraction of the ventricle pushes blood into the last chamber, the bulbus arteriosus, a highly elastic chamber.
7.49.2.1.1.5	The pressure imparted to the blood by the ventricle stretches the bulbus arteriosus, and its elastic recoil dampens the blood pressure oscillations generated by the beating of the heart.
7.49.2.1.1.6	The arterial blood leaving the bulbus arteriosus under pressure flows through the gills, where respiratory gases are exchanged.
7.49.2.1.1.7	Blood leaving the gills collects in a large dorsal artery, the aorta, which distributes blood to smaller arteries and arterioles leading to all the organs and tissues of the body.
7.49.2.1.1.8	In the tissues, blood flows through beds of tiny capillaries, collects in venules and veins, and eventually returns to the sinus venosus of the heart.
7.49.2.1.1.9	The unidirectional flow of blood in this circuit is enabled by one-way valves between the sinus venosus and the atrium, between the atrium and the ventricle, and between the ventricle and the bulbus arteriosus.
7.49.2.1.2.1	Most of the pressure imparted to the blood by the contraction of the ventricle is dissipated as a result of resistance to flow in the many narrow spaces in the gill lamellae (see Figure 48.5).
7.49.2.1.2.2	Therefore blood leaving the gills and entering the aorta is under low pressure, limiting the capacity of the fish circulatory system to supply the tissues with oxygen and nutrients.
7.49.2.1.2.3	Yet this limitation on arterial blood pressure does not seem to limit swimming performance.
7.49.2.1.2.4	Some species, such as tuna and marlin, can swim at remarkably high rates of speed for long distances.
7.49.2.1.3.1	The evolutionary transition from breathing water to breathing air had important consequences for the vertebrate circulatory system.
7.49.2.1.3.2	An example of how the system changed to serve a primitive lung can be seen in the African lungfishes.
7.49.2.2.1.1	Lungfishes are exposed periodically to water with low oxygen content or to situations in which their aquatic environment dries up.
7.49.2.2.1.2	The adaptation that deals with these conditions is an outpocketing of the gut that serves as a lung.
7.49.2.2.1.3	The lung contains many thin-walled blood vessels, so blood flowing through those vessels can pick up oxygen from air gulped into the lung.
7.49.2.2.2.1	How does the lungfish circulatory system take advantage of this new organ?
7.49.2.2.2.2	In fishes, the gills are arranged on supportive gill arches (see Figure 48.5A and B).
7.49.2.2.2.3	Blood flows into the gill arch in an afferent arteriole and leaves in an efferent arteriole.
7.49.2.2.2.4	In lungfishes, the blood vessels in the posterior pair of gill arteries have been modified into a low-resistance conduit for blood to the lung, and a separate pulmonary vessel carries oxygenated blood from the lung back to the heart.
7.49.2.2.2.5	In addition, blood from the heart flows directly into the dorsal aorta through two anterior gill arches that have lost their gill filaments.
7.49.2.2.2.6	A few of the gill arches retain gill filaments, so the African lungfishes can exchange respiratory gases with either air or water.
7.49.2.2.3.1	The lungfish heart partially separates its flow of blood into pulmonary and systemic circuits; it has a partially divided atrium.
7.49.2.2.3.2	The left side receives oxygenated blood from the lung, and the right side receives deoxygenated blood from the body via the sinus venosus.
7.49.2.2.3.3	These two bloodstreams stay mostly separate as they flow through the ventricle and the bulbus arteriosus.
7.49.2.2.3.4	As a result, oxygenated blood goes mostly to the anterior gill arteries leading to the dorsal aorta, and deoxygenated blood goes mostly to the other gill arches that have functional gill filaments.
7.49.2.2.3.5	The blood leaving those posterior gill arches flows to the dorsal aorta as well as to the lung.
7.49.2.2.3.6	Thus the dorsal aorta can receive oxygenated blood either from the lung (via the anterior gill arches) or from the gill filaments of the posterior gill arches.
7.49.2.2.4.1	We can conclude that the lungfish lung evolved as a means of supplementing oxygen uptake from the gills.
7.49.2.2.4.2	When the water is oxygenated, the lungfish can obtain oxygen through its gills; but in oxygen-depleted water, it can depend on getting oxygen from its lung.
7.49.2.2.4.3	Associated modifications of the lungfish vascular system set the stage for the evolution of separate pulmonary and systemic circulations in higher vertebrates.
7.49.2.3.1.1	In adult amphibians, a single ventricle pumps blood to the lungs and the rest of the body, but two atria receive blood returning to the heart.
7.49.2.3.1.2	The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs, and the right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the body.
7.49.2.3.2.1	Because both atria deliver blood to the same ventricle, the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood could mix, in which case blood going to the tissues would not carry a full load of oxygen.
7.49.2.3.2.2	Mixing is limited, however, because anatomical features of the ventricle direct the flow of deoxygenated blood from the right atrium primarily to the pulmonary circuit and the flow of oxygenated blood from the left atrium primarily to the aorta.
7.49.2.3.2.3	Partial separation of pulmonary and systemic circulation has the advantage of allowing blood destined for the tissues to sidestep the large pressure drop that occurs in the gas exchange organ.
7.49.2.3.2.4	Blood leaving the amphibian heart for the tissues moves directly to the aorta, and hence to the body, at a higher pressure than if it had first flowed through the lungs as it does in the fishes.
7.49.2.3.3.1	Amphibians have another adaptation for oxygenating their blood: they can pick up a considerable amount of oxygen in blood flowing through small blood vessels in their skin.
7.49.2.4.1.1	As described in Chapter 32, the reptiles include turtles, snakes, lizards, crocodilians, and birds (see Figures 32.21 and 32.22).
7.49.2.4.1.2	Crocodilians and birds have circulatory systems with two completely separated ventricles, creating a four-chambered heart.
7.49.2.4.1.3	All other reptiles have ventricles that are not completely separated into left and right chambers.
7.49.2.4.2.1	Consider the behavior, ecology, and physiology of ectothermic reptiles (i. e. , excluding birds).
7.49.2.4.2.2	Many are active, powerful, fast animals, but their activity comes in bursts that are interspersed with long periods of inactivity.
7.49.2.4.2.3	At these times the animals&#8217; metabolic rates are much lower than the resting metabolic rates of the endothermic birds and mammals.
7.49.2.4.2.4	So enormous is the range of metabolic demand in ectothermic reptiles that they do not need to breathe continuously.
7.49.2.4.2.5	Some species are accomplished divers and spend long periods under water, where they cannot breathe air.
7.49.2.4.3.1	When these animals are not breathing, it would be a waste of energy for them to pump blood through their lungs.
7.49.2.4.3.2	Thus they pump blood to the lungs and the rest of the body when they are breathing, but when they are not breathing, they can bypass the pulmonary circuit and pump most of the blood to the body.
7.49.2.4.3.3	How do they do this?
7.49.2.4.4.1	In ectothermic reptiles with a three-chambered heart   that is, the turtles, snakes, and lizards   the ventricle is partially divided into left and right halves by a septum.
7.49.2.4.4.2	Oxygenated blood from the lungs enters the left side of the ventricle through the left atrium.
7.49.2.4.4.3	Deoxygenated blood from the body enters the right side of the ventricle through the right atrium.
7.49.2.4.4.4	These species have two aortas, left and right.
7.49.2.4.4.5	The left aorta is positioned so that it receives oxygenated blood from the left side of the ventricle.
7.49.2.4.4.6	The right aorta, however, is positioned so that it can receive blood from either the right or left side of the ventricle.
7.49.2.4.5.1	When the animal is breathing air, the resistance in the pulmonary circuit is lower than the resistance in the systemic circuit, so blood from the right side of the ventricle tends to flow into the pulmonary artery rather than the right aorta.
7.49.2.4.5.2	When the animal is not breathing, pulmonary vessels constrict, resistance in the pulmonary circuit goes up, and blood from the right side of the ventricle tends to flow into the right aorta.
7.49.2.4.5.3	As a result, blood from both sides of the ventricle flows through the two aortas to the systemic circuit.
7.49.2.4.6.1	Crocodilians, like birds, have two completely separated ventricles.
7.49.2.4.6.2	Unlike birds, they have two aortas, one originating in each ventricle.
7.49.2.4.6.3	But there is a connection between the two aortas just as they leave the heart, and this connection enables them to alter the proportions of blood going to their pulmonary and systemic circuits.
7.49.2.4.6.4	When a crocodile or alligator is breathing and resistance in the pulmonary circuit is low, backpressure from the stronger left ventricle closes the valve between the right ventricle and the right aorta, forcing all of the blood from the right ventricle to flow into the pulmonary circuit.
7.49.2.4.6.5	When the animal stops breathing, pulmonary vessels constrict, resistance in the pulmonary circuit rises, and pressure in the right ventricle overcomes the backpressure in the right aorta from the left ventricle.
7.49.2.4.6.6	As a result, the blood from the right ventricle flows into the right aorta.
7.49.2.4.6.7	This ability of all ectothermic reptiles to direct blood to their pulmonary or systemic circuits is highly adaptive for their lifestyle of intermittent breathing.
7.49.2.5.1.1	The four-chambered hearts of birds and mammals have completely separate pulmonary and systemic circuits.
7.49.2.5.1.2	Separate circuits have several advantages for these active animals with continuously high metabolic rates:
7.49.2.5.2.1	Oxygenated and deoxygenated blood cannot mix; therefore the systemic circuit always receives blood with the highest oxygen content.
7.49.2.5.3.1	Respiratory gas exchange is maximized because the blood with the lowest oxygen content and highest CO2 content is sent to the lungs.
7.49.2.5.4.1	Separate systemic and pulmonary circuits can operate at different pressures.
7.49.2.5.5.1	The tissues of birds and mammals have high nutrient demands and thus a very high density of blood vessels, requiring the heart to generate a high blood pressure to perfuse all the vessels of the systemic circuit.
7.49.2.5.5.2	The pulmonary circuit of these animals receives a blood flow equal to that of the systemic circuit, but the lungs have far fewer blood vessels.
7.49.2.5.5.3	Thus the pulmonary circuit of birds and mammals can function at lower pressures, and the four-chambered heart makes that possible.
7.49.2.5.6.1	49.2 recap
7.49.2.5.7.1	The closed circulatory system of vertebrates has evolved from a single circuit system in fishes to separate pulmonary and systemic circuits in birds and mammals.
7.49.2.5.7.2	A key step was the evolution of a primitive lung in a lineage of air-breathing fishes.
7.49.2.5.7.3	Further adaptations increasingly separated the flows of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in separate circuits, as seen in amphibians and reptiles.
7.49.2.5.7.4	Ectothermic reptiles retained the ability to direct blood to either the pulmonary or systemic circuit, but mammals and birds have complete division of those two circuits, allowing the circuits to function at different pressures.

7.49.2.5.18.1	We will turn now to the structure and function of the mammalian heart, focusing in particular on human cardiac function.
7.49.2.5.19.1	Chapter 49 continues with
7.49.2.5.20.1	49.3 Heart Function Depends on Properties of Cardiac Muscle
7.49.3.1.1	Blood flows from right heart to lungs to left heart to body
7.49.3.2.1	The heartbeat originates in the cardiac muscle
7.49.3.3.1	A conduction system coordinates the contraction of heart muscle
7.49.3.4.1	HCM can disrupt conduction
7.49.3.5.1	Electrical properties of ventricular muscles sustain heart contraction
7.49.3.6.1	The ECG records the electrical activity of the heart
7.49.3.7.1	In this section we describe in detail the structure and function of the mammalian heart, using the human heart as the example.
7.49.3.7.2	We first trace the paths of blood flow through the heart and the body, and then we examine the unique electrical properties of cardiac muscle that result in the rhythmic contractions of the heart.
7.49.3.8.1	focus your learning
7.49.3.9.1	Blood flow in mammalian hearts goes from right atrium to right ventricle to lungs and from left atrium to left ventricle to the systemic circulation.
7.49.3.9.2	Valves prevent backflow.
7.49.3.10.1	In each cardiac cycle, both atria contract first, followed by both ventricles contracting, which is then followed by relaxation.
7.49.3.11.1	Action potentials in cardiac muscle cells depend on the properties of the ion channels in their membranes.
7.49.3.12.1	The mammalian heart, and therefore the human heart, has four chambers   a right and a left atrium and a right and a left ventricle (Figure 49.2).
7.49.3.12.2	The right atrium receives blood from the systemic circuit, and the left atrium receives blood from the pulmonary circuit.
7.49.3.12.3	The right ventricle pumps blood through the pulmonary circuit, and the left ventricle pumps blood through the systemic circuit.
7.49.3.12.4	Figure 49.2 The Human Heart and Circulation
7.49.3.13.1	One-way valves between the atria and ventricles, the atrioventricular (AV) valves, prevent backflow of blood into the atria when the ventricles contract.
7.49.3.13.2	The right AV valve is called the tricuspid valve because it has three leaves.
7.49.3.13.3	The left AV valve is called the bicuspid valve because it has two leaves.
7.49.3.13.4	The bicuspid valve is also called the mitral valve because it has the shape of a religious headdress called a miter.
7.49.3.13.5	There are also one-way valves between the ventricles and the arteries leaving the heart.
7.49.3.13.6	The pulmonary valve goes to the lungs, and the aortic valve goes to the aorta.
7.49.3.13.7	These two valves are also called semi-lunar valves because their separate leaves are shaped like half moons.
7.49.3.1.1.1	The superior (upper) vena cava and the inferior (lower) vena cava (see Figure 49.2) are the large veins that return deoxygenated blood to the right atrium from the upper and lower body, respectively.
7.49.3.1.1.2	The veins of the heart itself also drain into the right atrium.
7.49.3.1.1.3	From the right atrium, the blood flows through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle.
7.49.3.1.1.4	The filling of the ventricle is mostly passive flow while the heart is relaxed between beats.
7.49.3.1.1.5	At the end of this phase of passive ventricular filling, the atrium contracts and adds a little more blood to the ventricular volume.
7.49.3.1.1.6	The right ventricle then contracts, causing the tricuspid valve to close and pumping the blood into the pulmonary artery leading to the lungs.
7.49.3.1.2.1	Pulmonary veins return the oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium, from where the blood enters the left ventricle through the bicuspid valve.
7.49.3.1.2.2	As on the right side of the heart, most left ventricular filling is passive, and is only topped off when the atria contract.
7.49.3.1.3.1	The walls of the ventricles are powerful muscles that contract around the blood with a wringing motion starting from the bottom.
7.49.3.1.3.2	When pressure in the left ventricle is high enough to push open the aortic valve, blood rushes into the aorta to begin its circulation throughout the body.
7.49.3.1.3.3	In Figure 49.2 observe that the walls of the left ventricle are thicker than those of the right ventricle.
7.49.3.1.3.4	The left ventricle has to propel blood through many more kilometers of blood vessels than does the right ventricle, and must therefore push against more resistance, even though both ventricles pump the same volume of blood.
7.49.3.1.4.1	It is the left ventricle that creates the condition of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) that you learned about at the beginning of this chapter.
7.49.3.1.4.2	Mutations that reduce the efficiency of contraction of the cardiac muscle result in the work load of the left ventricle being greater than normal, so the ventricular muscle compensates by getting bigger (hypertrophy).
7.49.3.1.4.3	When the heart is repeatedly stressed by high levels of activity, as is common in athletes, the hypertrophy can become extreme (Figure 49.3).
7.49.3.1.4.4	The consequences can be blockage of blood flowing into the aorta and disruption of the signals that coordinate the contractions of the ventricular muscles.
7.49.3.1.4.5	Figure 49.3 Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy
7.49.3.1.5.1	Both sides of the heart contract at the same time.
7.49.3.1.5.2	Contraction of the two atria, followed by contraction of the two ventricles and then relaxation, is the cardiac cycle.
7.49.3.1.5.3	The cardiac cycle is divided into two phases: systole (pronounced s  s-toll-ee), when the ventricles contract, and diastole (die-  s-toll-ee), when the ventricles relax (Focus: Key Figure 49.4).
7.49.3.1.5.4	At the very end of diastole (step 1 in Figure 49.4), just before the ventricles contract, the atria contract and top off the volume of blood in the ventricles.
7.49.3.1.6.1	focus: key figure
7.49.3.1.7.1	Figure 49.4 The Cardiac Cycle
7.49.3.1.8.1	(A) The rhythmic contraction (systole) and relaxation (diastole) of the ventricles is called the cardiac cycle.
7.49.3.1.8.2	(B) During diastole, the ventricles fill and pressure is low.
7.49.3.1.8.3	During systole, the ventricular pressure rises and the ventricles empty.
7.49.3.1.8.4	The representation here shows pressure and volume changes for the left ventricle only.
7.49.3.1.8.5	The dashed lines represent the maximum and minimum volumes of blood in the left ventricle.
7.49.3.1.9.1	Q: If these curves were for the right ventricle instead of the left ventricle, how would they differ and how would they be the same?
7.49.3.1.10.1	The sounds of the cardiac cycle   the &#8220;lub-dup&#8221; heard through a stethoscope   are created by the heart valves slamming shut.
7.49.3.1.10.2	The closing and opening of these valves are simple mechanical events resulting from pressure differences on the two sides of the valves.
7.49.3.1.10.3	As the ventricles begin to contract (step 2 in Figure 49.4), the pressure in them rises above the pressure in the atria, so the AV valves close (&#8220;lub&#8221;).
7.49.3.1.10.4	When the ventricles begin to relax (step 4 in Figure 49.4), the high pressure in the aorta and pulmonary artery closes the aortic and pulmonary valves (&#8220;dup&#8221;).
7.49.3.1.11.1	Defective valves that do not close completely produce turbulent blood flow and the sounds known as heart murmurs.
7.49.3.1.11.2	For example, if an AV valve does not close completely, blood will flow back into the atrium with a &#8220;whoosh&#8221; at the beginning of systole.
7.49.3.1.12.1	Blood pressure changes associated with the cardiac cycle can be measured in the large artery in your arm by using an inflatable pressure cuff and a pressure gauge, together called a sphygmomanometer, and a stethoscope (Figure 49.5).
7.49.3.1.12.2	This method measures the minimum pressure necessary to compress an artery so blood does not flow through it at all (the systolic pressure) and the maximum pressure that allows continuous flow through the artery (the diastolic pressure).
7.49.3.1.12.3	A conventional blood pressure reading is expressed as the systolic pressure placed over the diastolic pressure.
7.49.3.1.12.4	Healthy values for a young adult might be 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) during systole and 70 mm Hg during diastole, or 120/70.
7.49.3.1.12.5	Modern blood pressure measuring devices such as you might encounter in a drugstore are automated so that the stethoscope is unnecessary.
7.49.3.1.12.6	Figure 49.5 Measuring Blood Pressure
7.49.3.2.1.1	Cardiac muscle has unique adaptations that enable it to function as a pump.
7.49.3.2.1.2	Cardiac muscle cells are in electrical contact with one another through gap junctions that enable action potentials to spread rapidly from cell to cell.
7.49.3.2.1.3	Because a spreading action potential stimulates contraction, large groups of cardiac muscle cells contract in unison.
7.49.3.2.1.4	This coordinated contraction is essential for pumping blood effectively.
7.49.3.2.2.1	Some cardiac muscle cells are pacemaker cells that initiate action potentials without stimulation from the nervous system.
7.49.3.2.2.2	When they fire action potentials, they stimulate neighboring cells to contract.
7.49.3.2.2.3	The primary pacemaker of the heart is a group of modified cardiac muscle cells, the sinoatrial node, located at the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium (see Figure 49.8).
7.49.3.2.2.4	The resting membrane potentials of these cells are less negative than those of other cardiac muscle cells and are not stable; instead they gradually become even less negative until they reach threshold for initiating an action potential.
7.49.3.2.2.5	The action potentials of pacemaker cells are very different from those of neurons and other muscle cells (see Figure 44.8).
7.49.3.2.2.6	They are slower to rise; they are broader; and they are slower to return to resting potential (Figure 49.6A).
7.49.3.2.2.7	These properties of pacemaker cells are due to the ion channels in their membranes.
7.49.3.2.2.8	Figure 49.6 The Pacemaker Potential
7.49.3.2.3.1	Pacemaker potentials involve Na&#0043;, Ca2&#0043;, and K&#0043; channels (Figure 49.6B).
7.49.3.2.3.2	As discussed in Key Concept 44.2, when Na&#0043; or Ca2&#0043; channels open, positive charges flow into the cell and the membrane potential becomes less negative.
7.49.3.2.3.3	When K&#0043; channels open, positive charges flow out of the cell and the membrane potential becomes more negative.
7.49.3.2.3.4	Because the Na&#0043; channels of pacemaker cells are open more of the time than are those of other cardiac muscle cells, the pacemaker resting potential is less negative.
7.49.3.2.3.5	The action potential of pacemaker cells is due to voltage-gated Ca2&#0043; channels rather than voltage-gated Na&#0043; channels as in neurons, skeletal muscle, and other cardiac muscle cells.
7.49.3.2.3.6	These Ca2&#0043; channels open and close more slowly than voltage-gated Na&#0043; channels, explaining the shape of pacemaker action potentials.
7.49.3.2.4.1	The unstable resting potential of pacemaker cells is due to the behavior of cation channels.
7.49.3.2.4.2	As in neurons and skeletal muscle cells, the rise of the action potential is followed by opening of voltage-gated K&#0043; channels.
7.49.3.2.4.3	The increased permeability of the cells to K&#0043; brings the membrane potential back to a negative level.
7.49.3.2.4.4	But, that restoration of a negative membrane potential causes a unique class of voltage-gated Na&#0043; channels to open.
7.49.3.2.4.5	At the same time, the voltage-gated K&#0043; channels that restored the negative membrane potential are gradually closing.
7.49.3.2.4.6	The opening Na&#0043; channels and closing K&#0043; channels cause the membrane potential to drift upwards (become less negative) (see Figure 49.6B).
7.49.3.2.5.1	The gradual rise in membrane potential closes the channels that allow Na&#0043; to move into the cell, but as the membrane becomes less negative, some Ca2&#0043; channels open, causing the membrane potential to continue its gradual rise.
7.49.3.2.5.2	These Ca2&#0043; channels are called T-types because they open transiently.
7.49.3.2.5.3	Eventually the rising membrane potential reaches threshold for the major voltage-gated Ca2&#0043; channels to open.
7.49.3.2.5.4	These Ca2&#0043; channels are called L-types because their opening is long-lasting.
7.49.3.2.5.5	It is the opening of these L-type Ca2&#0043; channels that generates the pacemaker action potential.
7.49.3.2.5.6	The intricate interaction of these ion channels through their effects on membrane potential causes the rhythmic generation of action potentials that characterizes pacemaker cells.
7.49.3.2.6.1	The autonomic nervous system controls the heartbeat (speeds it up or slows it down) by influencing the rate at which the membrane potentials of pacemaker cells drift upward (Figure 49.7).
7.49.3.2.6.2	Norepinephrine (NE) released onto pacemaker cells by sympathetic nerves increases the permeability of the Na&#0043; channels and the Ca2&#0043; channels.
7.49.3.2.6.3	The result is that the resting potential of the pacemaker cells drifts up more rapidly, the interval between action potentials is decreased, and the heart beats faster.
7.49.3.2.6.4	Conversely, the parasympathetic neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) has opposite effects.
7.49.3.2.6.5	ACh increases the permeability of K&#0043; channels so that the membrane potential becomes even more negative following an action potential and rises more slowly.
7.49.3.2.6.6	ACh also decreases the permeability of the Ca2&#0043; channels so that the rate of rise of the membrane potential slows, the interval between pacemaker action potentials lengthens, and the heart slows down.
7.49.3.2.6.7	Figure 49.7 The Autonomic Nervous System Controls Heart Rate
7.49.3.3.1.1	A normal heartbeat begins with an action potential in the sinoatrial node (Figure 49.8).
7.49.3.3.1.2	This action potential spreads rapidly throughout the electrically coupled cells of the atria, causing them to contract in unison.
7.49.3.3.1.3	Because there are no gap junctions between the cells of the atria and those of the ventricles, the action potential does not spread directly to the ventricles.
7.49.3.3.1.4	Therefore the ventricles do not contract in unison with the atria.
7.49.3.3.1.5	Figure 49.8 The Heartbeat
7.49.3.3.2.1	How does the action potential move from the atria to the ventricles?
7.49.3.3.2.2	Situated at the junction of the atria and the ventricles is a nodule of modified cardiac muscle cells   the atrioventricular node   which is stimulated by the depolarization of the atria.
7.49.3.3.2.3	With a slight delay, it generates action potentials that are conducted to the ventricles via the bundle of His, which are modified cardiac muscle fibers that do not contract but do conduct action potentials.
7.49.3.3.2.4	These fibers course down the septum between the left and right ventricles and divide into right and left bundle branches.
7.49.3.3.2.5	The branches of conducting fibers run to the tips of the ventricles and then spread throughout the ventricular muscle mass as Purkinje fibers.
7.49.3.3.2.6	This system of conducting fibers ensures that the cardiac action potential spreads rapidly and evenly throughout the ventricular muscle mass, starting at the very bottom of the ventricles.
7.49.3.3.2.7	The short delay in the spread of the action potential imposed by the atrioventricular node ensures that the atria contract before the ventricles do, so that the blood passes progressively from the atria to the ventricles to the arteries.
7.49.3.4.1.1	Returning to the case of HCM introduced at the beginning of this chapter, consider in Figure 49.8 how HCM can impair the function of the left ventricle.
7.49.3.4.1.2	First, in many cases the septum between the ventricles is greatly modified by the hypertrophy, and this can disrupt the conducting fibers that run down through the septum.
7.49.3.4.1.3	Second, the thickening of the septum near the aorta can block the entrance to the aorta and therefore impede blood flow and the emptying of the ventricle.
7.49.3.4.1.4	How can these effects be prevented?
7.49.3.4.1.5	In Investigating Life: Silencing Mutant Myosin Genes we describe a recent study on mice that have been genetically engineered to carry mutations of a gene for one of the myosin chains of cardiac muscle that is associated with a large percentage of human HCM cases.
7.49.3.4.1.6	These mice develop the pathologies that are seen in humans who inherit the genes causing HCM.
7.49.3.4.1.7	The investigators found that by using *RNAi to silence the mutated genes, they could prevent the development of the HCM pathology.

7.49.3.4.5.2	Allele-specific silencing of mutant Myh6 allele in mice suppresses hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
7.49.3.4.5.3	Science 342: 111   114.
7.49.3.4.6.1	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is caused by mutations in myosin genes.
7.49.3.4.6.2	A similar mutation has been engineered into mice, and they develop HCM.
7.49.3.4.6.3	In addition, it was shown that treatment of these mice with cyclosporine A (CsA) exacerbates their development of HCM.
7.49.3.4.6.4	Since the HCM model mice are heterozygous for the mutated gene (as are most afflicted humans), and since there are multiple myosin genes, the question arose as to whether or not the selective silencing of the mutant gene would allow the normal alleles to correct the disorganization of the cardiac muscle due to the mutant allele.
7.49.3.4.7.1	HYPOTHESES
7.49.3.4.8.1	Mice genetically engineered to carry a mutation in the myosin gene most commonly responsible for HCM in humans will show the HCM phenotype, and it will be exacerbated by treatment with CsA.
7.49.3.4.9.1	Silencing expression of the mutant gene will prevent the development of the HCM phenotype.
7.49.3.4.10.1	METHOD
7.49.3.4.11.1	Using genetic engineering techniques, generate a mouse model that carries a mutation in one of its myosin genes.
7.49.3.4.11.2	The heterozygotes are viable, but the homozygotes are not.
7.49.3.4.12.1	Using the wild type mice as a comparison, measure left ventricular wall thickness in mutant mice with and without treatment with CsA to exacerbate the development of left ventricular wall hyperthrophy.
7.49.3.4.13.1	Develop an interference RNA (RNAi) that will silence expression of the mutant gene in vitro.
7.49.3.4.14.1	Transfect mice heterozygous for the mutation with the RNAi construct and at a later time assess them for hypertrophy of their left ventricular walls.
7.49.3.4.14.2	Some mice are also treated with CsA, which exacerbates the development of hypertrophy in the mutant mice.
7.49.3.4.15.1	Calculate the means and SDs for each cohort of mice.
7.49.3.4.15.2	Then do non-paired t-tests to see if there are significant differences.
7.49.3.4.16.1	RESULTS
7.49.3.4.17.1	Data in the graph are simulated based on reported means and standard deviations.
7.49.3.4.18.1	CONCLUSION
7.49.3.4.19.1	The mice carrying the mutation show a significant (P &lt; 0.003) increase in left ventricular wall thickness.
7.49.3.4.19.2	The mutant mice treated with CsA show a larger increase in left ventricular wall thickness (P &lt; 0.001) in comparison with the mutant mice not CsA treated.
7.49.3.4.19.3	Thus the mutation has the expected effect of promoting the development of HCM symptoms, and the effect is exacerbated by treatment with CsA.
7.49.3.4.20.1	work with the data
7.49.3.4.21.1	The second hypothesis posed in the experiment above is that treatment of the mutant mice with interference RNA (RNAi) targeted to the mutant myosin gene will reduce the development of the HCM phenotype.
7.49.3.4.21.2	The data are listed in the table.
7.49.3.4.21.3	All values are for left ventricular wall thickness (mm) of individual mice and are simulated based on the reported means and SDs.

7.49.3.4.23.1	Comparing mutant mice that did not receive CsA, did the treatment with RNAi significantly reduce their left ventricular wall thickness?
7.49.3.4.24.1	Comparing mutant mice that did receive CsA, did the treatment with RNAi significantly reduce their left ventricular wall thickness?
7.49.3.4.25.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.49.3.4.26.1	*connect the concepts The use of RNAi to block gene expression at the mRNA level is discussed in KeyConcept 18.4.
7.49.3.5.1.1	Electrical properties of ventricular muscle fibers allow them to contract for about 300 milliseconds   much longer than skeletal muscle fibers.
7.49.3.5.1.2	As in neuronal and skeletal muscle action potentials, the rising phase of the ventricular muscle cell action potentials is due to the opening of voltage-gated Na&#0043; channels.
7.49.3.5.1.3	Unlike neurons and skeletal muscle fibers, however, ventricular muscle cells remain depolarized for a long time.
7.49.3.5.1.4	This extended plateau of the action potential is due to sustained opening of voltage-gated Ca2&#0043; channels (Figure 49.9).
7.49.3.5.1.5	Like other muscle, cardiac muscle is stimulated to contract when Ca2&#0043; is available to bind with troponin (see Figure 47.6).
7.49.3.5.1.6	As long as Ca2&#0043; remains in the sarcoplasm, the ventricular muscle cells continue to contract.
7.49.3.5.1.7	Figure 49.9 The Action Potential of Ventricular Muscle Fibers
7.49.3.5.2.1	To terminate systole and allow the ventricles to fill again, Ca2&#0043; must be rapidly cleared from the sarcoplasm of the ventricular cells.
7.49.3.5.2.2	Ca2&#0043; pumps in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane and the cell membrane actively transport Ca2&#0043; ions out of the sarcoplasm and into the sarcoplasmic reticulum or into the intersitial fluid.
7.49.3.5.2.3	Thus Ca2&#0043; in the sarcoplasm is maintained at a low level until the next action potential triggers another round of Ca2&#0043; release and muscle contraction.
7.49.3.5.2.4	The rate of cycling of Ca2&#0043; into and out of the sarcoplasm puts limits on the heart rate and strength of contraction of the ventricle.
7.49.3.6.1.1	Electrical events in the cardiac muscle during the cardiac cycle are recorded by electrodes placed on the surface of the body.
7.49.3.6.1.2	Such a recording is an electrocardiogram, or ECG, or EKG reflecting the Greek spelling (kardia).
7.49.3.6.1.3	The ECG is an important tool for diagnosing heart problems (Figure 49.10A).
7.49.3.6.1.4	Figure 49.10 The Electrocardiogram
7.49.3.6.2.1	The action potentials that sweep through the muscles of the atria and ventricles before they contract are massive, localized electrical events causing electric currents to flow throughout the body.
7.49.3.6.2.2	Electrodes placed at different locations on the skin detect those currents at different times and register a voltage difference between them.
7.49.3.6.2.3	The appearance of the ECG depends on the placement of the electrodes.
7.49.3.6.2.4	Electrodes placed on the right wrist and left ankle produced the normal ECG shown in Figure 49.10B.
7.49.3.6.2.5	The wave patterns of the ECG are designated P, Q, R, S, and T, each letter representing a particular event in the cardiac muscle, as shown in the figure.
7.49.3.6.3.1	49.3 recap
7.49.3.6.4.1	The mammalian heart has two atria and two ventricles.
7.49.3.6.4.2	The right atrium and ventricle serve the pulmonary circuit, and the left atrium and ventricle serve the systemic circuit.
7.49.3.6.4.3	Valves that are open and shut by pressure differences prevent the backflow of blood.
7.49.3.6.4.4	Modified cardiac muscle tissue in the right atrium functions to spontaneously generate pacemaker action potentials.
7.49.3.6.4.5	Other modified cardiac muscle tissue between the atria and ventricles and throughout the ventricles conducts those signals and coordinates the heart contraction.
7.49.3.6.4.6	Broad action potentials in ventricular muscle reflect Ca2&#0043; cycling in the ventricular muscle cells and make sustained contractions possible.
7.49.3.6.5.1	learning outcomes
7.49.3.6.6.1	You should be able to:
7.49.3.6.7.1	Trace the path of blood through both sides of the heart, naming the major blood vessels and heart valves.
7.49.3.6.8.1	Describe how heart valves function.
7.49.3.6.9.1	Describe the cardiac cycle in terms of left ventricular volume and pressure, aortic pressure, and heart sounds.
7.49.3.6.10.1	Explain how calcium ion movement into and out of the sarcoplasm of cardiac muscle cells influences the rate and strength of contraction.
7.49.3.6.11.1	Valves of the heart can become stiff and calcified, limiting the flow of blood through them in a condition called stenosis.
7.49.3.6.11.2	What would be the consequences of aortic valve stenosis and of pulmonary valve stenosis?
7.49.3.6.12.1	Digitalis is a drug that causes an increase in Ca2&#0043; concentration in the cardiac muscle cells.
7.49.3.6.12.2	Why is it used to treat patients with a weakened heart?
7.49.3.6.13.1	Heart valve stenosis impedes blood flow, whereas heart valve prolapse allows blood to flow backward (regurgitation).
7.49.3.6.13.2	Both of these conditions can be detected as heart murmurs when a stethoscope is used to listen to heart sounds.
7.49.3.6.13.3	When in the cardiac cycle could a heart murmur indicate aortic valve stenosis, and when could it indicate aortic valve prolapse?
7.49.3.6.13.4	Explain your answer.
7.49.3.6.14.1	Next we will consider the composition of the blood and the characteristics of the vessels through which blood circulates around the body, illustrating once again how structure serves function.
7.49.3.6.14.2	We will also consider the role of the lymphatic vessels that return interstitial fluid to the blood.
7.49.3.6.15.1	Chapter 49 continues with
7.49.3.6.16.1	49.4 Circulatory System Functions Depend on Blood and Blood Vessels
7.49.4.1.1	Red blood cells transport respiratory gases
7.49.4.2.1	Platelets are essential for blood clotting
7.49.4.3.1	Arteries withstand high pressure, arterioles control blood flow
7.49.4.4.1	Materials are exchanged in capillary beds by filtration, osmosis, and diffusion
7.49.4.5.1	Blood flows back to the heart through veins
7.49.4.6.1	Lymphatic vessels return interstitial fluid to the blood
7.49.4.7.1	Vascular disease is a killer
7.49.4.8.1	Blood is a connective tissue, and like all connective tissues, it consists of cells suspended in an extracellular matrix.
7.49.4.8.2	There are a variety of blood cell types with different functions, and the extracellular matrix has a complex composition that is highly regulated.
7.49.4.8.3	The unusual feature of blood is that the extracellular matrix is a liquid, so blood is a fluid tissue that circulates in a system of closed vessels through the bodies of vertebrates and invertebrates that have closed circulatory systems.
7.49.4.8.4	The properties of the different classes of vessels reflect their functions.
7.49.4.9.1	focus your learning
7.49.4.10.1	Red blood cells are generated in bone marrow and, until they are destroyed in the spleen, they transport respiratory gases.
7.49.4.11.1	Platelets and blood proteins are responsible for blood clotting.
7.49.4.12.1	Smooth muscle cells in arteries and arterioles control blood flow to specific tissues and also control blood pressure.
7.49.4.13.1	Extracellular fluid exchange between the blood and the interstitial space occurs in capillary beds and depends on hydrostatic pressure pushing water out of the capillaries and osmotic pressure pulling water back into the capillaries.
7.49.4.14.1	One-way valves and muscle contraction help return venous blood to the heart.
7.49.4.15.1	The cells of the blood can be separated from the fluid matrix, called blood plasma, by centrifugation (Figure 49.11).
7.49.4.15.2	If a sample of blood is spun in a centrifuge, all the cells move to the bottom of the tube, leaving the clear, straw-colored blood plasma on top.
7.49.4.15.3	The packed-cell volume, or hematocrit, is the percentage of the blood volume made up by red blood cells (RBCs).
7.49.4.15.4	Normal hematocrit is about 42 percent for women and 46 percent for men, but these values can vary considerably.
7.49.4.15.5	They are usually higher, for example, in people who live and work at high elevations, because their exposure to low oxygen stimulates the production of more RBCs.
7.49.4.15.6	Between the blood plasma and the packed RBCs there is a very thin layer   less than 1 percent of the blood volume   called the buffy coat that contains most of the white blood cells and platelets.
7.49.4.15.7	Platelets are pinched-off fragments of a class of bone marrow cells.
7.49.4.15.8	Here we consider the RBCs and the platelets.
7.49.4.15.9	White blood cells, or leukocytes, are cells of the immune system, discussed in Chapter 41.
7.49.4.15.10	Figure 49.11 The Composition of Blood
7.49.4.1.1.1	As is obvious from the hematocrit, most blood cells are RBCs   also called erythrocytes.
7.49.4.1.1.2	Mature RBCs are biconcave, flexible discs that lack nuclei but are packed with hemoglobin.
7.49.4.1.1.3	Their function is to transport respiratory gases (see Key Concept 48.4).
7.49.4.1.1.4	The shape of RBCs gives them a large surface area for gas exchange, and their flexibility enables them to squeeze through narrow capillaries.
7.49.4.1.1.5	Men have 4.5   6.0 million red blood cells per microliter of blood, and women have 3.5   5.0 million.
7.49.4.1.2.1	RBCs, as well as all the other cellular components of blood, are generated by stem cells in the bone marrow, particularly in the ribs, breastbone, pelvis, vertebrae, and the long bones of the limbs.
7.49.4.1.2.2	RBC production is controlled by a hormone, erythropoietin (EPO), released by cells in the kidneys in response to insufficient oxygen   hypoxia.
7.49.4.1.2.3	Many tissues respond to hypoxia by expressing a transcription factor called hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1).
7.49.4.1.2.4	When the kidneys become hypoxic and express HIF-1, one of the actions of the transcription factor is to activate the gene encoding erythropoietin.
7.49.4.1.2.5	Increased circulating erythropoietin extends the lives of mature RBCs and stimulates production of new RBCs in the bone marrow.
7.49.4.1.3.1	Under normal conditions, your bone marrow produces about 2 million RBCs every second.
7.49.4.1.3.2	Developing RBCs divide many times while still in the bone marrow, and during this time they produce hemoglobin.
7.49.4.1.3.3	When hemoglobin makes up about 25 percent of the volume of the immature RBC, the nucleus is extruded from the cell and other cell organelles are also lost.
7.49.4.1.3.4	This process is almost complete when the newly mature RBC squeezes between the endothelial cells of blood vessels in the bone marrow and enters the circulation.
7.49.4.1.3.5	Loss of nuclei from the RBCs occurs in most mammalian species, but the RBCs of a few mammals and of all other vertebrates are nucleated.
7.49.4.1.4.1	Each RBC circulates for about 120 days.
7.49.4.1.4.2	As it gets older, its membrane becomes less flexible and more fragile, so older RBCs are more likely to rupture as they bend to fit through narrow capillaries.
7.49.4.1.4.3	RBCs are particularly squeezed in the spleen, an organ that sits near the stomach in the upper left side of the abdominal cavity.
7.49.4.1.4.4	The spleen has many sinuses (cavities) that serve as reservoirs for RBCs.
7.49.4.1.4.5	To get into the sinuses, however, the RBCs must squeeze between spleen cells.
7.49.4.1.4.6	When old RBCs are ruptured by this squeezing, their remnants are taken up and degraded by macrophages (a class of white blood cells that ingest debris and foreign materials; see Key Concept 41.3).
7.49.4.2.1.1	Besides producing erythrocytes and leukocytes, the bone marrow stem cells described in Key Concept 41.1 also produce cells called megakaryocytes.
7.49.4.2.1.2	Megakaryocytes are large cells that remain in the bone marrow and release platelets into the circulation.
7.49.4.2.1.3	A platelet is a tiny fragment of a cell without cell organelles, but it is packed with enzymes and chemicals necessary for its function: sealing leaks in blood vessels and initiating blood clotting (Figure 49.12).
7.49.4.2.1.4	Figure 49.12 Blood Clotting
7.49.4.2.2.1	Damage to a blood vessel exposes collagen fibers.
7.49.4.2.2.2	An encounter with collagen fibers activates platelets.
7.49.4.2.2.3	The platelet swells, becomes irregularly shaped and sticky, and releases chemicals that activate other platelets and initiate the clotting of blood.
7.49.4.2.2.4	The sticky platelets also form a plug at the damaged site.
7.49.4.2.3.1	Blood clotting requires many steps and many clotting factors, most of which are circulating in the blood in an inactive form.
7.49.4.2.3.2	The absence of any one of these proteins can impair clotting, resulting in excessive bleeding.
7.49.4.2.3.3	Because the liver produces most of the clotting factors, liver diseases such as hepatitis and cirrhosis can result in excessive bleeding.
7.49.4.2.3.4	People with hemophilia experience uncontrolled bleeding because of a genetic inability to produce a clotting factor.
7.49.4.2.4.1	Blood clotting factors participate in a cascade of chemical activations of other substances circulating in the blood.
7.49.4.2.4.2	The cascade begins with damage to a blood vessel or other tissue that exposes the blood to proteins such as collagen that are normally separated from the blood by endothelial cells lining the blood vessels.
7.49.4.2.4.3	This exposure activates platelets and begins the clotting factor cascade.
7.49.4.2.4.4	The end result of this cascade is to convert an inactive circulating enzyme, prothrombin, to its active form, thrombin.
7.49.4.2.4.5	Thrombin cleaves molecules of fibrinogen, a plasma protein, forming insoluble threads of fibrin.
7.49.4.2.4.6	The fibrin threads form the meshwork that binds platelets, seals the vessel, and provides a scaffold for the formation of scar tissue (see Figure 49.12).
7.49.4.3.1.1	The walls of the large arteries have many extracellular collagen and elastin fibers that enable them to withstand the high blood pressures generated by the heart (Figure 49.13A).
7.49.4.3.1.2	These elastic tissues have another important function: as you saw with the bulbus arteriosus in fish, they are stretched during systole, and thereby store some of the energy imparted to the blood by the heart.
7.49.4.3.1.3	Elastic recoil during diastole returns this energy to the blood by squeezing it and pushing it forward.
7.49.4.3.1.4	As a result, even though pressure in the arteries pulsates with the beating of the heart, the flow of blood is smoother than it would be through a system of rigid pipes.
7.49.4.3.1.5	Figure 49.13 Anatomy of Blood Vessels
7.49.4.3.2.1	Contraction of smooth muscle cells in the walls of the arteries constricts the vessels, and relaxation of the smooth muscle dilates them.
7.49.4.3.2.2	When the diameter of a vessel changes, its resistance to blood flow changes, and the amount of blood flowing through it changes as a result.
7.49.4.3.2.3	Neural and hormonal mechanisms act on smooth muscle cells in the walls of the arteries and arterioles, controlling the flow of blood through these vessels.
7.49.4.3.2.4	The arterioles are referred to as resistance vessels because their resistance can vary to control the blood flow to specific tissues.
7.49.4.4.1.1	Beds of capillaries lie between arterioles and venules (Figure 49.13B).
7.49.4.4.1.2	Most cells are not more than a few cell diameters away from a capillary.
7.49.4.4.1.3	The needs of cells are served by the exchange of materials between blood and interstitial fluid across the capillary walls.
7.49.4.4.1.4	Capillary walls are thin and permeable to water and many solutes.
7.49.4.4.1.5	Also, blood flows slowly through capillaries, allowing time for exchange.
7.49.4.4.2.1	It may seem strange that blood flows through the large arteries rapidly at high pressures, but when it reaches the small capillaries the pressure and rate of flow decrease (Figure 49.13C).
7.49.4.4.2.2	When you constrict the opening of a garden hose, the pressure in the hose and the velocity of the water spraying out increase.
7.49.4.4.2.3	But keep in mind that the arteries branch into many arterioles that serve huge numbers of capillaries.
7.49.4.4.2.4	Even though each capillary has a diameter so small that red blood cells pass through in single file, there are so many capillaries that their total cross-sectional area is much greater than that of any other class of vessel.
7.49.4.4.2.5	As a result, all the capillaries together have a much greater capacity for blood than do the arterioles.
7.49.4.4.3.1	Capillary walls consist of a single layer of endothelial cells (Figure 49.14).
7.49.4.4.3.2	Capillaries are permeable to water, some ions, and some small molecules but not to large molecules such as proteins, and certainly not to red blood cells.
7.49.4.4.3.3	At the arterial (high pressure) end, blood pressure squeezes water and small solutes out through spaces between the cells of the capillary walls into the surrounding intercellular space.
7.49.4.4.3.4	Figure 49.14 A Narrow Lane
7.49.4.4.4.1	Why don&#8217;t water and small-molecular-weight solutes collect in the intercellular spaces?
7.49.4.4.4.2	How is the blood volume maintained if fluid is continuously leaking out of the capillaries?
7.49.4.4.4.3	An answer to such questions was put forth more than 100 years ago by the physiologist E. H. Starling.
7.49.4.4.4.4	Starling suggested that water movement across capillary walls is a result of two opposing forces, which are now known as Starling&#8217;s forces:
7.49.4.4.5.1	Blood hydrostatic pressure squeezes water and small solutes out of the capillaries.
7.49.4.4.6.1	Blood osmotic pressure pulls water back into the capillaries.
7.49.4.4.7.1	Blood hydrostatic pressure is high at the arterial end of a capillary bed and steadily drops as blood moves toward the venous end (Figure 49.15).
7.49.4.4.7.2	Blood osmotic pressure is due to the large protein molecules that cannot leave the capillaries, and it is relatively constant along the capillaries.
7.49.4.4.7.3	As long as the blood hydrostatic pressure is above the blood osmotic pressure, fluid leaves the capillaries.
7.49.4.4.7.4	At the venule end of most capillaries, blood hydrostatic pressure falls below blood osmotic pressure, so fluid returns to the capillaries.
7.49.4.4.7.5	The actual numbers for a normal capillary bed in a resting person suggest that there would be a slight net loss of fluid to the intercellular spaces.
7.49.4.4.7.6	This loss, about 4 liters per day, percolates between cells as the interstitial fluid before it returns to the venous blood via the lymphatic system, which we will discuss later in this chapter.
7.49.4.4.7.7	Figure 49.15 Starling&#8217;s Forces
7.49.4.4.8.1	Recent research suggests that in addition to large protein molecules in the blood, bicarbonate ions (HCO3   ) may also contribute significantly to pulling water back into the capillaries.
7.49.4.4.8.2	The CO2 produced by cellular metabolism diffuses into the endothelial cells lining the capillaries, where it is converted into HCO3    and released into the plasma.
7.49.4.4.8.3	When an individual is at rest, the increasing HCO3    concentration can cause the blood osmotic pressure at the venous end to be 30 mm Hg higher than at the arterial end, and during strenuous exercise this difference can be much higher.
7.49.4.4.8.4	Thus it appears that CO2 and HCO3    are major factors that pull water back into the capillaries.
7.49.4.4.9.1	All capillaries are permeable to O2, CO2, and small ions.
7.49.4.4.9.2	Lipid-soluble substances readily pass through the capillary walls.
7.49.4.4.9.3	Water and small solutes pass through intercellular spaces in the capillary wall, and through holes called fenestrations in the endothelial cells.
7.49.4.4.9.4	More permeable and less selective capillaries are found in the digestive tract, where nutrients are absorbed, and in the kidneys, where wastes are filtered.
7.49.4.4.9.5	Capillary endothelial cells also contain transporters that can facilitate the passage of specific molecules, such as glucose and lactate.
7.49.4.4.9.6	Overall, permeability varies widely in different capillary beds   an important consideration in the design and delivery of drugs.
7.49.4.4.10.1	The capillaries of the brain are a special case, being rather impermeable and wrapped by glia.
7.49.4.4.10.2	Not much can pass through them other than lipid-soluble substances (including alcohol and anesthetics).
7.49.4.4.10.3	This high selectivity of brain capillaries is known as the blood   brain barrier.
7.49.4.4.10.4	Even in the brain, however, there are specific regions where the capillaries are more permeable, enabling the brain to detect non-lipid-soluble hormones.
7.49.4.5.1.1	The pressure of the blood flowing from capillaries to venules is low and insufficient to propel blood back to the heart.
7.49.4.5.1.2	The walls of veins are more expandable than the walls of arteries, and blood tends to accumulate in veins.
7.49.4.5.1.3	As much as 60 percent of your total blood volume may be in your veins when you are resting.
7.49.4.5.1.4	Because of their high capacity to stretch and store blood, veins are called capacitance vessels.
7.49.4.5.2.1	Blood flow through veins that are above the level of the heart is assisted by gravity.
7.49.4.5.2.2	Below the level of the heart, however, venous return is against gravity.
7.49.4.5.2.3	The most important force propelling blood from these regions is the squeezing of the veins by the contractions of surrounding skeletal muscles.
7.49.4.5.2.4	As muscles contract, the veins are compressed and blood is squeezed through them.
7.49.4.5.2.5	Blood flow may be temporarily obstructed during a prolonged muscle contraction, but when muscles relax, blood is free to move again.
7.49.4.5.2.6	One-way valves in the veins of the extremities prevent backflow of blood.
7.49.4.5.2.7	Thus whenever a vein is squeezed, blood is propelled forward toward the heart (Figure 49.16).
7.49.4.5.2.8	Figure 49.16 One-Way Flow
7.49.4.5.3.1	In a resting person, gravity causes blood accumulation in the veins of the lower body and exerts backpressure on the capillary beds.
7.49.4.5.3.2	This backpressure shifts the balance between blood hydrostatic pressure and osmotic pressure, causing increased loss of fluid to the intercellular spaces.
7.49.4.5.3.3	That is why your feet swell during a long airline flight.
7.49.4.5.4.1	Because of the one-way valves in the veins of the legs, the contractions of leg muscles act as auxiliary vascular pumps when an animal walks or runs and facilitate the return of blood to the heart from the lower body.
7.49.4.5.4.2	As a greater volume of blood is returned to the heart, the heart contracts more forcefully and its pumping action is enhanced.
7.49.4.5.4.3	The heartbeat gets stronger because of a property of cardiac muscle cells described by the Frank   Starling law: if the cardiac muscle cells are stretched, as they are when the volume of returning blood increases, they contract more forcefully.
7.49.4.5.5.1	The actions of breathing also help return venous blood to the heart.
7.49.4.5.5.2	The muscles involved in inhalation create negative pressure that pulls air into the lungs (see Figure 48.11), and this negative pressure also pulls blood toward the chest, increasing venous return to the right atrium.
7.49.4.5.5.3	In addition, some of the largest veins closest to the heart contain smooth muscle that contracts at the onset of exercise.
7.49.4.5.5.4	Contraction of veins can rapidly increase venous return and stimulate the heart in accord with the Frank   Starling law, increasing cardiac output.
7.49.4.6.1.1	The interstitial fluid contains water and other small molecules, but no RBCs, and less protein than found in plasma.
7.49.4.6.1.2	A separate system of vessels   the *lymphatic system   returns interstitial fluid to the blood.
7.49.4.6.1.3	Each capillary bed contains at least one blind-ended lymph capillary.
7.49.4.6.2.1	*connect the concepts The lymphatic system is introduced in conjunction with the immune system.
7.49.4.6.2.2	See Key Concept 41.1.
7.49.4.6.3.1	Interstitial fluid that enters the lymphatic vessels is called lymph.
7.49.4.6.3.2	Fine lymphatic capillaries merge into progressively larger vessels and ultimately into the right and the left lymphatic ducts   that empty into large veins at the base of the neck (see Figure 41.2).
7.49.4.6.3.3	The left lymphatic duct, also known as the thoracic duct, carries most of the lymph from the lower part of the body and is larger than the right lymphatic duct.
7.49.4.6.3.4	Lymphatic vessels, like veins, have one-way valves that keep the lymph flowing toward the lymphatic ducts.
7.49.4.6.3.5	Therefore lymph, like blood, is propelled toward the heart by skeletal muscle contractions and breathing movements.
7.49.4.6.3.6	Lymph nodes along the major lymphatic vessels are a major site of lymphocyte production and of the phagocytic action that removes microorganisms and other foreign materials from the circulation.
7.49.4.7.1.1	As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, cardiovascular disease is responsible for about one-fourth of all deaths each year in the United States, and the same is true in Europe.
7.49.4.7.1.2	The immediate cause of most of these deaths is not a defect in heart muscle as in cases of HCM, but is heart attack or stroke   both of which are usually the result of a disease called arteriosclerosis (&#8220;hardening of the arteries&#8221;) that begins many years before symptoms are detected.
7.49.4.7.2.1	Healthy arteries have a smooth internal lining of endothelial cells (Figure 49.17A) that can be damaged by chronic high blood pressure, smoking, a high-fat diet, or microorganisms.
7.49.4.7.2.2	Deposits called plaque begin to form at sites of endothelial damage, initiating an early stage of arteriosclerosis called atherosclerosis.
7.49.4.7.2.3	First, the damaged endothelial cells attract certain white blood cells to the site.
7.49.4.7.2.4	These cells are then joined by smooth muscle cells migrating from the deeper layers of the arterial wall.
7.49.4.7.2.5	Lipids, especially cholesterol, are deposited in these cells, so that the developing plaque becomes fatty.
7.49.4.7.2.6	Fibrous connective tissue made by the invading smooth muscle cells in the plaque, along with deposits of calcium, gradually make the artery wall less elastic   hence &#8220;hardening of the arteries. &#8221; Plaque deposits narrow the artery and causes turbulence in the blood flow.
7.49.4.7.2.7	Blood platelets stick to the plaque (see Figure 49.12) and initiate formation of an intravascular blood clot, a thrombus that can block the artery (Figure 49.17B).
7.49.4.7.2.8	Figure 49.17 Atherosclerotic Plaque
7.49.4.7.3.1	The blood supply to the heart muscle flows through the coronary arteries, which are highly susceptible to atherosclerosis.
7.49.4.7.3.2	As these arteries narrow, blood flow to the heart muscle decreases, causing the symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath during mild exertion.
7.49.4.7.3.3	A person with atherosclerosis is at high risk of forming a thrombus in a coronary artery.
7.49.4.7.3.4	This condition, called coronary thrombosis, can totally block the vessel, causing a myocardial infarction (heart attack).
7.49.4.7.4.1	A piece of a thrombus that breaks loose, called an embolus, is likely to travel to and become lodged in a vessel of smaller diameter, blocking its flow (an embolism).
7.49.4.7.4.2	Arteries already narrowed by plaque formation are likely places for an embolism.
7.49.4.7.4.3	An embolism in an artery in the brain causes the cells fed by that artery to die.
7.49.4.7.4.4	This event is a stroke.
7.49.4.7.4.5	The specific damage resulting from a stroke, such as memory loss, speech impairment, or paralysis, depends on the location of the blocked artery in the brain.
7.49.4.7.5.1	Important risk factors for developing atherosclerosis are your genetic predisposition and your age.
7.49.4.7.5.2	Environmental risk factors also play a large role, however.
7.49.4.7.5.3	These include high-fat and high-cholesterol diets, smoking, and a sedentary lifestyle.
7.49.4.7.5.4	Certain untreated medical conditions such as hypertension (high blood pressure), obesity, and diabetes are also risk factors for atherosclerosis.
7.49.4.7.5.5	For those who have a genetic predisposition to atherosclerosis, it is even more important to minimize environmental risk factors.
7.49.4.7.5.6	Changes in diet and behavior and treatment of predisposing medical conditions can prevent and reverse early atherosclerosis and help fend off this silent killer.
7.49.4.7.6.1	49.4 recap
7.49.4.7.7.1	Blood is a fluid tissue with cellular components that play roles in transport of respiratory gases, immune system function, and blood clotting.
7.49.4.7.7.2	The properties of the arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins reflect their functions.
7.49.4.7.7.3	Exchanges between the blood and interstitial fluids occur in the smallest of those vessels, the capillaries.
7.49.4.7.7.4	These exchanges are governed by Starling&#8217;s forces and the movement of HCO3    into the blood.
7.49.4.7.7.5	Lymphatic vessels return interstitial fluid to the blood.

7.49.4.7.16.1	Why is the blood clotting process called a cascade?
7.49.4.7.17.1	Why are arterioles called resistance vessels and veins called capacitance vessels, and what do these terms imply about function?
7.49.4.7.18.1	In advanced starvation, the body breaks down its blood plasma proteins for energy.
7.49.4.7.18.2	At this stage of disease, fluid accumulates in the abdomen and the extremities.
7.49.4.7.18.3	What is the connection between these two consequences of starvation?
7.49.4.7.19.1	Every tissue in the body requires an adequate flow of oxygen-saturated blood.
7.49.4.7.19.2	Blood flow depends on the maintenance of an appropriate blood pressure, and the distribution of blood flow throughout the body depends on control of the resistance in the blood vessels supplying different tissues.
7.49.4.7.20.1	Chapter 49 continues with
7.49.4.7.21.1	49.5 The Circulation Is Controlled by Hormonal and Neural Signals
7.49.5.1.1	Autoregulation matches local blood flow to local need
7.49.5.2.1	Arterial pressure is regulated by hormonal and neural mechanisms
7.49.5.3.1	When we investigate how a physiological process is regulated, we start by identifying the critical components of that process, how they can be controlled, and the information used to govern that control.
7.49.5.3.2	Because blood flow depends on pressure, we can identify the mean arterial pressure as a critical variable of the circulatory system.
7.49.5.4.1	focus your learning
7.49.5.5.1	Local blood flow is controlled to meet local metabolic need by autoregulatory responses of arteriole smooth muscles.
7.49.5.6.1	Mean arterial pressure is regulated through neural and hormonal control of smooth muscles in arterioles.
7.49.5.7.1	Baroreceptors in the walls of large arteries continuously convey blood pressure information to the cardiovascular regulatory center in the brain, which controls the neural and hormonal mechanisms that influence mean arterial pressure.
7.49.5.8.1	Pressure in the aorta oscillates between systole and diastole, and the duration of diastole is usually twice as long as that of systole (see Figure 49.4).
7.49.5.8.2	Therefore a simple way of estimating the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is to take the diastolic pressure and add to it one-third of the difference between systolic and diastolic pressure.
7.49.5.8.3	However, to understand the physiological mechanisms that control MAP, we have to consider the factors that determine it.
7.49.5.8.4	MAP is determined by the cardiac output (CO) and the resistance to flow in the blood vessels, or total peripheral resistance (TPR):
7.49.5.9.1	MAP = CO &#215; TPR
7.49.5.10.1	Since CO is equal to the heart rate (HR) times how much blood the heart pumps with each beat (stroke volume [SV]), the critical relationships can be expressed as:
7.49.5.11.1	MAP = HR &#215; SV &#215; TPR
7.49.5.12.1	HR, SV, and TPR are controlled by neural and hormonal mechanisms at both the local and systemic levels.
7.49.5.13.1	At the local level, each tissue controls its own blood flow through autoregulatory mechanisms that alter the diameter and therefore the resistance of the arterioles serving it.
7.49.5.13.2	The collective autoregulatory actions in the arterioles in all tissues of the body influence TPR and therefore MAP.
7.49.5.13.3	If many arterioles suddenly dilate, TPR goes down and MAP falls.
7.49.5.13.4	If many arterioles constrict, TPR goes up and MAP goes up.
7.49.5.13.5	Therefore changes in MAP provide information about changing needs of the body.
7.49.5.13.6	In addition, as blood flows through capillary beds, its composition changes   its CO2 content goes up and its O2 content goes down.
7.49.5.13.7	Thus blood composition also provides information the body uses to regulate the circulatory system.
7.49.5.14.1	The nervous and endocrine systems respond to changes in MAP and blood composition by changing breathing rate, heart rate, stroke volume, and peripheral resistance to match the metabolic needs of the body.
7.49.5.1.1.1	The amount of blood that flows through a capillary bed is controlled by the smooth muscle of the arteries and arterioles feeding that bed.
7.49.5.1.1.2	Figure 49.18 illustrates the flow of blood in a typical capillary bed.
7.49.5.1.1.3	Blood flows into the bed from an arteriole.
7.49.5.1.1.4	Smooth muscle &#8220;cuffs,&#8221; or precapillary sphincters, on the arteriole can shut off the supply of blood to the capillary bed.
7.49.5.1.1.5	When the precapillary sphincters are relaxed and the arteriole is open, blood flow through the capillaries increases.
7.49.5.1.1.6	Figure 49.18 Local Control of Blood
7.49.5.1.2.1	Autoregulation depends on the sensitivity of the smooth muscle to its local chemical environment.
7.49.5.1.2.2	Low O2 concentrations and high CO2 concentrations cause the smooth muscle to relax, thus increasing the supply of blood, which brings in more O2 and carries away CO2   a response known as hyperemia, which means &#8220;excess blood. &#8221; Increases in other by-products of metabolism, such as lactic acid, hydrogen ions, potassium, and adenosine (all of which increase in exercising muscle), also promote hyperemia.
7.49.5.1.2.3	Hence activities that increase the metabolism of a tissue also induce hyperemia in that tissue.
7.49.5.2.1.1	Control and regulation of the circulatory system begins with the local autoregulatory mechanisms that alter the resistance of arteries and arterioles feeding capillary beds.
7.49.5.2.1.2	The demands of the capillary beds influence MAP and blood composition.
7.49.5.2.1.3	Both of these provide information for the control of endocrine and neural responses that act to return blood pressure and composition to normal.
7.49.5.2.1.4	Thus circulatory functions are matched to the regional and overall needs of the body.
7.49.5.2.2.1	Arteries and arterioles are innervated by the autonomic nervous system, particularly the sympathetic division.
7.49.5.2.2.2	The sympathetic postganglionic neurotransmitter norepinephrine binds to receptors in smooth muscle in blood vessels in the gut and other tissues not essential for &#8220;fight or flight&#8221; and causes these vessels to constrict, resulting in reduced blood flow through them and an elevation in MAP.
7.49.5.2.2.3	As we discussed earlier in this chapter, increased sympathetic activity increases heart rate, and by increasing the strength of the cardiac muscle contraction, it also increases stroke volume.
7.49.5.2.3.1	Hormones also play a role in regulating arterial pressure.
7.49.5.2.3.2	Epinephrine has actions similar to those of norepinephrine and is released from the adrenal medulla during massive sympathetic activation stimulated by a fall in arterial pressure or by activation of the fight-or-flight response to a dangerous threat.
7.49.5.2.3.3	Another hormone, angiotensin, is produced when blood pressure in the kidneys falls (Figure 49.19).
7.49.5.2.3.4	These hormones influence arterioles located in peripheral tissues (extremities) or in tissues whose functions need not be maintained continuously (such as the digestive system).
7.49.5.2.3.5	By reducing blood flow in those arterioles, the hormones increase central blood pressure and blood flow to essential organs such as the heart, brain, and kidneys.
7.49.5.2.3.6	Figure 49.19 Control of Blood Pressure through Local and Systemic Mechanisms
7.49.5.2.4.1	The autonomic nervous system activity that controls heart rate and constriction of blood vessels originates in a cardiovascular control center in the medulla.
7.49.5.2.4.2	Many inputs converge on this central integrative network and influence the commands it issues via parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves (Figure 49.20).
7.49.5.2.4.3	Of special importance is incoming information about changes in blood pressure from baroreceptors (stretch receptors) in the walls of the large arteries leading to the brain   the aorta and the carotid arteries.
7.49.5.2.4.4	Figure 49.20 Regulating Cardiac Output
7.49.5.2.5.1	Increased activity in baroreceptors of the large arteries signals rising blood pressure and inhibits sympathetic nervous system signaling to arteries and arterioles while increasing parasympathetic signaling to the heart&#8217;s pacemaker.
7.49.5.2.5.2	As a result, the heart slows and arterioles in peripheral tissues dilate, reducing blood pressure.
7.49.5.2.5.3	If pressure in the large arteries falls, the activity of the baroreceptors decreases, stimulating sympathetic output to the arteries and arterioles while reducing parasympathetic output to the heart&#8217;s pacemaker.
7.49.5.2.5.4	As a result, the heart beats faster and the arterioles in peripheral tissues constrict, increasing blood pressure.
7.49.5.2.6.1	Another hormone that helps stabilize blood pressure is antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also called vasopressin), which is secreted by the posterior pituitary in response to a fall in the activity of the baroreceptors, signaling a fall in arterial pressure.
7.49.5.2.6.2	ADH causes the kidneys to reabsorb more water and thereby maintain blood volume and increase blood pressure (see Figure 51.14).
7.49.5.2.6.3	Increased activity of the baroreceptors inhibits the release of ADH, and as a result the kidneys excrete more water, reducing blood volume and contributing to a fall in arterial pressure (see Figure 49.19).
7.49.5.2.7.1	Other information that causes the cardiovascular control center to increase heart rate and blood pressure comes from *chemoreceptors in the medulla, aorta, and the carotid arteries.
7.49.5.2.8.1	*connect the concept Key Concept 48.5 discusses the mechanisms for sensing CO2 and O2 concentrations in the blood.
7.49.5.2.8.2	The medullary chemoreceptors are activated by increases in CO2 levels and decreases in pH, and the carotid and aortic bodies are activated by falling O2 levels.
7.49.5.2.8.3	Chemoreceptors send signals to the cardiovascular regulatory center as well as to the respiratory regulatory center.
7.49.5.2.9.1	49.5 recap
7.49.5.2.10.1	The delivery of blood to tissues is controlled locally by autoregulatory mechanisms that dilate or constrict arterioles.
7.49.5.2.10.2	These local actions are translated into alterations in central blood pressure and composition that are detected by neural and hormonal mechanisms, which then mediate corrective cardiovascular adjustments.

7.49.5.2.15.1	Draw a diagram showing how an increase or a decrease in the firing rate of baroreceptors causes a change in MAP.

7.49.5.2.19.1	Baroreceptor neurons have a range of firing rates depending on their degree of stretch, and at rest they are firing at the midpoint of that range.

7.49.5.2.22.1	Are there potential therapies that could treat HCM?
7.49.5.2.23.1	Any organ of your body can shut down for a while and you can recover   with one exception, your heart.
7.49.5.2.23.2	Cardiac arrest lasting only minutes can result in death.
7.49.5.2.23.3	But why should the heart of a healthy, physically fit, top-performing athlete stop?
7.49.5.2.23.4	Just as physical conditioning results in making skeletal muscles bigger and stronger, it does the same for the heart.
7.49.5.2.23.5	The heart responds to increased demand by getting bigger and stronger.
7.49.5.2.23.6	However, if an individual has a large number of mutations in genes responsible for proteins involved in contractions of cardiac muscle, that muscle will be less efficient.
7.49.5.2.23.7	To compensate for that inefficiency, the heart gets even bigger than a normal heart would when repeatedly challenged by excessive exercise.
7.49.5.2.23.8	Especially in the walls of the left ventricle, hypertrophy can have two serious consequences: (1) The opening of the aorta is at the top of the heart next to the septum that divides the two ventricles.
7.49.5.2.23.9	Enlargement of that septum can block the entrance to the aorta, so the cardiac output falls. (2) The bundle of His and the left and right bundle branches that convey the pacemaker potential to the ventricular muscle course down through the septum.
7.49.5.2.23.10	Hypertrophy of the septum can interfere with conduction of these critical signals.
7.49.5.2.23.11	If advanced conditions of HCM are discovered, there are surgical procedures that remove some of the heart muscle.
7.49.5.2.24.1	Future directions
7.49.5.2.25.1	The mutations responsible for the development of HCM are not rare, but most people who carry them live their entire lives without even knowing they are at risk for HCM.
7.49.5.2.25.2	Why?
7.49.5.2.25.3	Most people do not place the excessive demands on their hearts that athletes do.
7.49.5.2.25.4	So what can be done to reduce the risk of death by HCM?
7.49.5.2.25.5	Preventative measures such as genetic screening could allow carriers of the mutations to make decisions about whether or not to pursue extreme physical activity.
7.49.5.2.25.6	Physical examinations including ECGs, sonograms, and even magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would enable diagnosis and recommendations to decrease levels of physical exertion.
7.49.5.2.25.7	The work presented in Investigating Life: Silencing Mutant Myosin Genes suggests a potential future treatment through gene therapy.
7.49.5.2.25.8	If safe reagents could be developed to silence the mutant genes, and those reagents were applied before severe HCM developed, they could have a protective benefit.

7.49.summary.1.1	49.1 Circulatory Systems Serve Many Functions
7.49.summary.2.1	The metabolic needs of the cells of many small animals are met by direct exchange of materials with the external medium.
7.49.summary.2.2	The metabolic needs of the cells of larger animals are met by a circulatory system that transports nutrients, respiratory gases, and metabolic wastes throughout the body.
7.49.summary.3.1	In open circulatory systems, extracellular fluid called hemolymph leaves vessels and percolates through tissues before returning to the heart.
7.49.summary.3.2	In closed circulatory systems, blood   a portion of the extracellular fluid   is contained in a system of vessels.
7.49.summary.3.3	Closed circulatory systems have the ability to selectively direct blood, and therefore hormones and nutrients, to specific tissues.

7.49.summary.4.1	49.2 Vertebrate Circulatory Systems Evolved from Single to Double Circuits
7.49.summary.5.1	The circulatory system of vertebrates consists of a heart and a closed system of vessels containing blood that is separate from the interstitial fluid.
7.49.summary.5.2	Arteries and arterioles carry blood from the heart; capillaries are the site of exchange between blood and interstitial fluid; venules and veins carry blood back to the heart.
7.49.summary.6.1	The vertebrate circulatory system evolved from a single circuit in fishes to partially or completely separate pulmonary and systemic circuits in amphibians, reptiles, and mammals.
7.49.summary.7.1	In the single-circuit system of fishes, blood flow is unidirectional and is propelled by one-way valves between the sinus venosus and the atrium, between the atrium and the ventricle, and between the ventricle and the bulbus arteriosus.
7.49.summary.8.1	In birds and mammals, blood circulates through two completely separate circuits.

7.49.summary.37.3	Journal of Experimental Biology 213: 2673   2680.
7.49.summary.38.1	Crocodilian hearts are four-chambered, just like those of birds and mammals.
7.49.summary.38.2	But crocodiles have two aortas   one from each ventricle   and the flow into each is controlled by a valve.
7.49.summary.38.3	The two aortas are connected by a shunt after they leave the heart.
7.49.summary.38.4	Thus, the right ventricle of the crocodile heart can pump blood to the lungs or to the rest of the body.
7.49.summary.38.5	If the crocodile is breathing, the resistance in the pulmonary circuit is low, and blood flows through the pulmonary artery because high backpressure from the left ventricle exerted through the shunt keeps the right aortic valve shut.
7.49.summary.38.6	When the animal is not breathing, the pulmonary resistance increases, and blood from the right ventricle flows into the right aorta.
7.49.summary.38.7	Researchers tried to demonstrate an adaptive advantage to the aortic shunt in crocodiles.
7.49.summary.39.1	Working with young American alligators (5   7 months of age), the researchers surgically closed the right aorta near the right ventricle so that blood from the right ventricle could not flow through it to the body but had to flow through the lungs, as in an avian or mammalian circulatory system.
7.49.summary.39.2	The researchers performed sham operations on a similar group of animals, as controls.

7.50.1.6.1	Nutrient deficiencies result in diseases
7.50.1.7.1	Animals are heterotrophs&#8212;they derive their nutrition from eating other organisms.
7.50.1.7.2	In contrast, autotrophs (most plants, some bacteria, some archaea, and some protists) can use solar energy or inorganic chemical energy to synthesize all of their components.
7.50.1.7.3	Of course, some * plants are also heterotrophs.
7.50.1.8.1	* connect the concepts Carnivorous and parasitic plants are discussed in Key Concept 35.5.
7.50.1.9.1	focus your learning
7.50.1.10.1	Fats, carbohydrates, and proteins in food provide energy.
7.50.1.11.1	Energy is stored in animal bodies as glycogen and fat.
7.50.1.12.1	Some small organic molecules required for biosynthesis, including essential amino acids and fatty acids, must come from food.
7.50.1.13.1	Vitamins are organic compounds that the animal cannot synthesize but are required for healthy cell function.
7.50.1.14.1	Animals require a variety of mineral nutrients.
7.50.1.14.2	Figure 50.1  Heterotrophs Get Energy from Autotrophs
7.50.1.15.1	Directly and indirectly, heterotrophs take advantage of&#8212;indeed, depend on&#8212;the organic synthesis carried out by autotrophs and have evolved an enormous diversity of adaptations to exploit this resource (Figure 50.1).
7.50.1.15.2	In this section we describe how animals use food, be it plants or other animals, to obtain energy and building blocks of complex molecules.
7.50.1.15.3	We also consider the need for special mineral nutrients and organic molecules and the diseases that result when they are lacking in the diet.
7.50.1.1.1.1	Energy&#8212;the capacity to do work&#8212;comes in different forms, including electric, heat, chemical, and nuclear energy.
7.50.1.1.1.2	As discussed in Chapter 8, a calorie (note the small c) is a unit of heat energy; specifically, it is the amount of heat necessary to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water 1&#176;C.
7.50.1.1.1.3	Because this is such a tiny amount of energy, physiologists commonly use the kilocalorie (kcal) as a unit of measure (1 kcal = 1,000 calories).
7.50.1.1.1.4	Nutritionists also use the kilocalorie as a standard unit of energy, but they traditionally refer to it as the Calorie (Cal), which is capitalized to distinguish it from the single calorie.
7.50.1.1.2.1	Just about any food container you pick up in the United States carries the label &#8220;Nutrition Facts,&#8221; which includes the item &#8220;Calories. &#8221; How do Calories (or kcal) relate to the discussion in Chapter 9 about how energy in the chemical bonds of food molecules is transferred to the high-energy phosphate bonds of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and is then used to do cellular work?
7.50.1.1.2.2	And why do we use heat energy as a measure of nutrition?
7.50.1.1.3.1	The reason is found in the * laws of thermodynamics, which tell us that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but can be converted from one form to another.
7.50.1.1.4.1	* connect the concepts The laws of thermodynamics and their application to biological energetics are described in Key Concept 8.1.
7.50.1.1.5.1	However, every energy conversion is inefficient; a large portion of the original energy always ends up as heat.
7.50.1.1.5.2	Whether we are using the energy in glucose to make ATP or are using that ATP to power muscle contraction or ion transport, most of the available chemical energy is lost as heat.
7.50.1.1.5.3	The bottom line is that if an animal is not growing, not doing any external work, and not changing its body temperature, the heat it loses to the environment is a measure of its total energy expenditure, or metabolism.
7.50.1.1.6.1	An animal&#8217;s energy needs must be met by the ingestion, digestion, and assimilation of food.
7.50.1.1.6.2	The basal energy expenditure (basal metabolic rate, BMR) of a human is 1,300&#8211;1,500 Cal/day for an adult female and 1,600&#8211;1,800 Cal/day for an adult male.
7.50.1.1.6.3	Any physical activity adds to the BMR.
7.50.1.1.6.4	For a person doing sedentary work, about 30 percent of the total Calories expended are used for skeletal muscle activity; for a person doing heavy physical labor, more than 95 percent of caloric expenditure is for skeletal muscle activity.
7.50.1.1.7.1	The components of food that provide energy are fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.
7.50.1.1.7.2	Fats yield 9.5 Cal/gram, carbohydrates 4.2 Cal/gram, and proteins about 4.1 Cal/gram.
7.50.1.1.7.3	Figure 50.2 shows some equivalencies of food, energy, and energy consumption.
7.50.1.1.7.4	Figure 50.2 Food Energy and How We Use It
7.50.1.1.8.1	Even though the units calorie, kilocalorie, and Calorie remain in popular use, most scientists now use the International System of Units (ISU).
7.50.1.1.8.2	In this system the basic unit of energy is the joule: 1 joule = 0.239 calories, and the measure of energy use is 1 joule/second = 1 watt.
7.50.1.1.8.3	You are familiar with light bulb ratings, so think about that when you convert kcal/day into watts.
7.50.1.1.8.4	The 1,700 Cal/day energy expenditure of the average man converts to 82 watts (note that a watt includes the time dimension, so it is a rate of energy use).
7.50.1.1.9.1	Thus it is possible to quantify the caloric value of any food an animal eats.
7.50.1.1.9.2	It is also possible to quantify the caloric expenditure of any activity or behavior an animal performs.
7.50.1.1.9.3	By comparing calories consumed with calories expended, we can construct energy budgets that allow ecologists and evolutionary biologists to apply a * cost&#8211;benefit analysis to feeding behavior.
7.50.1.1.10.1	* connect the concepts Any behavior involves energetic costs, opportunity costs, and risk costs and can be measured in terms of its effect on reproductive success.
7.50.1.1.10.2	Key Concept 52.4 explores costs and benefits of various behaviors, illustrating how measures of metabolism permit quantitative analysis of evolutionary adaptations.
7.50.1.2.1.1	Although cells of the body use energy continuously, most animals do not eat continuously and so must store fuel molecules that can be released as needed between meals.
7.50.1.2.1.2	Carbohydrates are stored in the liver and in muscle cells as glycogen, but the total glycogen stored represents only about a day&#8217;s basal energy requirement.
7.50.1.2.1.3	Fat is the most important form of stored energy in the bodies of animals.
7.50.1.2.1.4	Not only does fat have more energy per gram than glycogen, but it can be stored with little associated water, making it more compact and less expensive to carry.
7.50.1.2.1.5	Migrating birds store energy as fat to fuel their long flights; if they had to store the same amount of energy as glycogen, they would be too heavy to fly.
7.50.1.2.1.6	Proteins are not used as energy storage compounds, but the body&#8217;s proteins can be metabolized as an energy source of last resort.
7.50.1.2.2.1	If an animal takes in too little food to meet its energy requirements, it starts to metabolize some of the molecules of its own body.
7.50.1.2.2.2	This &#8220;self-consumption&#8221; begins with the energy storage compounds glycogen and fat.
7.50.1.2.2.3	Once fat reserves are seriously depleted, the body increases its metabolism of proteins for energy (Figure 50.3A).
7.50.1.2.2.4	The first proteins to be sacrificed are those of the blood plasma.
7.50.1.2.2.5	The loss of plasma proteins decreases the osmotic concentration of the plasma, resulting in increased loss of fluid from the blood to the interstitial spaces (edema).
7.50.1.2.2.6	Accumulation of fluid in the extremities and abdomen is the classic sign of kwashiorkor, a disease caused by chronic protein deficiency (Figure 50.3B).
7.50.1.2.2.7	Continued protein loss damages the body&#8217;s organs, eventually leading to death.
7.50.1.2.2.8	Figure 50.3 The Course of Starvation
7.50.1.2.3.1	When an animal consistently takes in more food than it needs to meet its energy requirements, the excess nutrients are stored as increased body mass.
7.50.1.2.3.2	First glycogen reserves build up; then additional dietary carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are converted to body fat.
7.50.1.2.3.3	In some species, such as hibernators, seasonal overnutrition is an important adaptation for surviving periods when food is not available.
7.50.1.2.3.4	In humans, however, overnutrition can be a serious health hazard, increasing the risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, diabetes, and other disorders, as seen in the Pima that were discussed in the chapter opener.
7.50.1.3.1.1	Every animal must take in certain organic molecules that it cannot synthesize for itself but needs to form the building blocks of its own complex organic molecules.
7.50.1.3.1.2	The acetyl group (CH3CO&#8211;) is one such required building block, supplying the carbon skeleton of larger organic molecules (Figure 50.4).
7.50.1.3.1.3	Animals cannot synthesize acetyl groups from carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen molecules but must obtain them from food.
7.50.1.3.1.4	Acetyl groups can be derived from the metabolism of almost any food, but they originate in plants.
7.50.1.3.1.5	Figure 50.4  The Acetyl Group Is an Acquired Carbon Skeleton
7.50.1.3.2.1	Acetyl groups are never in short supply for an adequately nourished animal.
7.50.1.3.2.2	However, some groups supplying carbon skeletons can be deficient in an animal&#8217;s diet even if caloric intake is adequate.
7.50.1.3.2.3	One such group includes certain amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.
7.50.1.3.2.4	Animals can synthesize some of their own amino acids using carbon skeletons from acetyl or other groups and transferring to them amine groups (&#8211;NH2) derived from other amino acids.
7.50.1.3.2.5	However, most animals cannot synthesize all the amino acids they need and thus must obtain certain essential amino acids from food.
7.50.1.3.2.6	If an animal does not take in enough of even one of its essential amino acids, its protein synthesis is impaired and its capacity to maintain enzymatic and transport functions is challenged.
7.50.1.3.3.1	Essential amino acids vary by species.
7.50.1.3.3.2	Most researchers agree that adult humans must obtain eight essential amino acids from their food: isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine.
7.50.1.3.3.3	All eight are available in milk, eggs, meat, and soybean products, but most plant foods do not contain adequate quantities of all eight, so a strict vegetarian diet carries a risk of protein malnutrition.
7.50.1.3.3.4	A complementary diet of plant foods, however, supplies all eight essential amino acids (Figure 50.5).
7.50.1.3.3.5	In general, grains (such as rice, wheat, and corn) are complemented by legumes (such as beans and peas).
7.50.1.3.3.6	Long before the chemical basis for complementarity was understood, societies with little access to meat developed complementary diets.
7.50.1.3.3.7	Many Central and South American peoples traditionally eat beans with corn, and the native peoples of North America complemented their beans with squash.
7.50.1.3.3.8	Figure 50.5  A Strategy for Vegetarians
7.50.1.3.4.1	Human infants are thought to require four additional amino acids in their diets: histidine, tyrosine, cysteine, and arginine.
7.50.1.3.4.2	Also, some amino acids are required by individuals with certain metabolic disorders who cannot synthesize them adequately.
7.50.1.3.4.3	For example, individuals with the genetic disease phenylketonuria lack the enzyme for converting phenylalanine to tyrosine (see Key Concept 15.2) and must obtain tyrosine from their diets.
7.50.1.3.4.4	They must keep their dietary intake of phenylalanine low to prevent its accumulation to toxic levels.
7.50.1.3.5.1	Why are dietary proteins completely digested to their constituent amino acids before being used by the body?
7.50.1.3.5.2	Wouldn&#8217;t it be more energy-efficient to reuse some dietary proteins directly?
7.50.1.3.5.3	There are several reasons why ingested proteins are not used &#8220;as is&#8221;:
7.50.1.3.6.1	Macromolecules such as proteins are not readily absorbed by the cells of the gut, but their constituent monomers (such as amino acids) are readily absorbed.
7.50.1.3.7.1	Protein structure and function are highly species-specific.
7.50.1.3.7.2	A protein that functions optimally in one species might not function well in another.
7.50.1.3.8.1	Foreign proteins entering the body directly from the gut would be recognized as invaders and would be attacked by the immune system.
7.50.1.3.9.1	Humans can synthesize almost all the lipids required by the body using acetyl groups obtained from food (see Figure 50.4), but we must have a dietary source of two essential fatty acids&#8212;linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid&#8212;that we cannot synthesize.
7.50.1.3.9.2	Linoleic acid is needed by mammals to synthesize other unsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, which is a component of several signaling molecules, including prostaglandins.
7.50.1.3.9.3	Essential fatty acids are also necessary components of membrane phospholipids.
7.50.1.3.9.4	A deficiency of linoleic acid can lead to problems such as infertility and impaired lactation, but because it is commonly present in vegetable oils, a deficiency is unlikely in an adequately nourished individual.
7.50.1.4.1.1	Principal mineral elements that animals require are listed in Table 50.1.
7.50.1.4.1.2	Elements required in large amounts are called macronutrients; those required in only tiny amounts (generally less than 100 mg/day) are called micronutrients.
7.50.1.4.1.3	Some micronutrients are required in such minute amounts that deficiencies are never observed, but they are nevertheless essential elements.

7.50.1.4.3.1	Calcium is an example of a macronutrient.
7.50.1.4.3.2	It is the fifth most abundant element in the body; a 70-kg person contains about 1.2 kg of calcium.
7.50.1.4.3.3	Calcium phosphate is the principal structural material in bones and teeth.
7.50.1.4.3.4	Muscle contraction, neural function, and many other intracellular functions in animals require * calcium ions (Ca2+).
7.50.1.4.3.5	The turnover of calcium in the extracellular fluid is high, as bones are constantly being remodeled and calcium is constantly entering and leaving cells.
7.50.1.4.3.6	Calcium is lost from the body in urine, sweat, and feces, so it must be replaced regularly.
7.50.1.4.3.7	Adult humans require 800&#8211;1,000 mg of calcium per day in their diet.
7.50.1.4.4.1	* connect the concepts Many physiological processes are affected by Ca2+; therefore it is essential that the blood levels stay between 9 and 11 mg/100 mL.
7.50.1.4.4.2	This is only 0.1 percent of the Ca2+ in the body.
7.50.1.4.4.3	About 1 percent is intracellular and 99 percent is in the bones, thus it is a challenge to maintain tiny, but critical, blood levels in the face of such huge reservoirs.
7.50.1.4.4.4	Hormonal regulation of blood calcium is discussed in Key Concept 40.4, and the cellular mechanisms are discussed in Key Concept 47.1.
7.50.1.4.5.1	Iron is an example of a micronutrient.
7.50.1.4.5.2	It is found throughout the body because it is the oxygen-binding atom in hemoglobin and myoglobin and is a component of enzymes in the respiratory chain.
7.50.1.4.5.3	Nevertheless, the total amount of iron in a 70-kg person is only about 4 g, and since iron is recycled efficiently in the body and is not lost in the urine, we require only about 15 mg per day in our food.
7.50.1.4.5.4	Despite the small amount required, insufficient iron is the most common mineral nutrient deficiency in the world today.
7.50.1.4.5.5	Iron deficiency leads to anemia, a condition that renders individuals weak and tired all the time.
7.50.1.5.1.1	Like essential amino acids and fatty acids, vitamins are carbon compounds that an animal requires for growth and metabolism but cannot synthesize for itself.
7.50.1.5.1.2	Most vitamins function as coenzymes or parts of coenzymes (see Key Concept 8.4).
7.50.1.5.2.1	Each species has its own vitamin requirements.
7.50.1.5.2.2	Primates, for example, require vitamin C (ascorbic acid).
7.50.1.5.2.3	While most mammals can make their own ascorbic acid, primates (including humans) cannot, so for primates, ascorbic acid is a vitamin.
7.50.1.5.2.4	If we do not get vitamin C in our food, we develop scurvy, a disease characterized by bleeding gums, loss of teeth, subcutaneous hemorrhages, and slow wound healing.
7.50.1.5.2.5	Scurvy was a frequently fatal problem for sailors on long voyages until late in the eighteenth century, when a Scottish physician, James Lind, discovered that the disease could be prevented if the sailors ate fresh greens and citrus fruit.
7.50.1.5.2.6	The British Admiralty made limes standard provisions for its ships (and British sailors have been called &#8220;limeys&#8221; ever since).
7.50.1.5.2.7	When the active ingredient in limes was isolated, it was named ascorbic (&#8220;without scurvy&#8221;) acid.
7.50.1.5.3.1	Humans require 13 vitamins; these are divided into two groups, water-soluble and fat-soluble (Table 50.2).
7.50.1.5.3.2	When water-soluble vitamins are ingested in excess of bodily needs, they are simply eliminated in the urine.
7.50.1.5.3.3	(This is the fate of much of the large doses of vitamin C that people take. )
7.50.1.5.3.4	Fat-soluble vitamins, however, can accumulate in body fat and may build up to toxic levels in the liver if taken in excess.
7.50.1.5.4.1	table 50.2 Vitamins in the Human Diet Vitamin Source Function Deficiency symptoms WATER-SOLUBLE &#8194;B1 (thiamin) Liver, legumes, whole grains Coenzyme in cellular respiration Beriberi, loss of appetite, fatigue &#8194;B2 (riboflavin) Dairy, meat, eggs, green leafy vegetables Coenzyme in FAD Lesions in corners of mouth, eye irritation, skin disorders &#8194;B3 (niacin) Meat, fowl, liver, yeast Coenzyme in NAD and NADP Pellagra, skin disorders, diarrhea, mental disorders &#8194;B5 (pantothenic acid) Liver, eggs, yeast Found in acetyl CoA Adrenal problems, reproductive problems &#8194;B6 (pyridoxine) Liver, whole grains, dairy foods Coenzyme in amino acid metabolism Anemia, slow growth, skin problems, convulsions &#8194;B7 (biotin) Liver, yeast, bacteria in gut Found in coenzymes Skin problems, loss of hair &#8194;B12 (cobalamin) Liver, meat, dairy foods, eggs Formation of nucleic acids, proteins, red blood cells Pernicious anemia &#8194;Folic acid Vegetables, eggs, liver, whole grains Coenzyme in formation of heme and nucleotides Anemia &#8194;C (ascorbic acid) Citrus fruits, tomatoes, potatoes Formation of connective tissues; antioxidant Scurvy, slow healing, poor bone growth Fat-soluble &#8194;A (retinol) Fruits, vegetables, liver, dairy Found in visual pigments Night blindness &#8194;D (calciferol) Fortified milk, fish oils, sunshine Absorption of calcium and phosphate Rickets &#8194;E (tocopherol) Meat, dairy foods, whole grains Muscle maintenance, antioxidant Anemia &#8194;K (menadione) Intestinal bacteria, liver Blood clotting Blood clotting problems
7.50.1.5.5.1	The fat-soluble vitamin D (calciferol), which is essential for absorbing and metabolizing calcium, is a special case because the body can synthesize it.
7.50.1.5.5.2	(As noted in Key Concept 40.4, vitamin D is by definition a hormone. )
7.50.1.5.5.3	Certain lipids present in the human body can be converted into vitamin D by the action of ultraviolet light on the skin.
7.50.1.5.5.4	Thus vitamin D must be obtained in the diet by individuals with inadequate exposure to the sun.
7.50.1.5.6.1	The need for vitamin D may have been an important factor in the evolution of skin color.
7.50.1.5.6.2	For humans living in equatorial and low latitudes, dark skin pigmentation is adaptive, as it is a protection against the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation.
7.50.1.5.6.3	These peoples generally expose extensive areas of skin to the sun on a regular basis, so their skin synthesizes adequate amounts of vitamin D. Most races that adapted to life in the higher latitudes lost this dark skin pigmentation, probably because lighter skin facilitates vitamin D production in the relatively small areas of skin exposed to sunlight during the short days of winter.
7.50.1.5.6.4	The dark-skinned Inuit peoples of the Arctic are an exception to the correlation between latitude and skin pigmentation, but the Inuit obtain ample vitamin D from the large amounts of animal fat (especially whale blubber) and fish oils in their diet.
7.50.1.6.1.1	The lack of an essential nutrient in the diet produces a state of malnutrition, and chronic malnutrition leads to a characteristic deficiency disease (see Table 50.2).
7.50.1.6.1.2	We discussed kwashiorkor (protein deficiency) and scurvy (vitamin C deficiency).
7.50.1.6.1.3	Another deficiency disease, beriberi, was directly involved in the discovery of vitamins.
7.50.1.6.2.1	Beriberi, which means &#8220;extreme weakness,&#8221; became prevalent in Asia in the nineteenth century when it became standard practice to mill rice to a white polish and discard the hulls present in brown rice.
7.50.1.6.2.2	A critical observation was that chickens and pigeons developed beriberi-like symptoms when they were fed only polished rice.
7.50.1.6.2.3	In 1912 Casimir Funk, a Polish scientist working in England, cured pigeons of beriberi by feeding them discarded rice hulls.
7.50.1.6.3.1	At the time of Funk&#8217;s discovery, all diseases were thought either to be caused by microorganisms or to be inherited.
7.50.1.6.3.2	Funk suggested that beriberi and some other diseases are dietary in origin and result from deficiencies in specific substances.
7.50.1.6.3.3	Funk coined the term &#8220;vitamines&#8221; from &#8220;vital amines&#8221; because he mistakenly thought that all these substances vital for life were compounds with amine groups.
7.50.1.6.3.4	In 1926 thiamin (vitamin B1)&#8212;the substance lost in the rice milling process&#8212;was the first vitamin to be isolated in pure form.
7.50.1.6.4.1	Deficiency diseases can also result from an inability to absorb or process an essential nutrient even if it is present in the diet.
7.50.1.6.4.2	Vitamin B12 (cobalamin), for example, is present in all foods of animal origin.
7.50.1.6.4.3	Since plants neither use nor produce vitamin B12, a strictly vegetarian diet (not supplemented with dairy products or vitamin pills) can lead to a B12 deficiency disease called pernicious anemia, characterized by a failure of red blood cells to mature.
7.50.1.6.4.4	The most common cause of pernicious anemia, however, is not a lack of vitamin B12 in the diet but an inability to absorb it.
7.50.1.6.4.5	Normally cells in the stomach lining secrete a peptide called intrinsic factor that binds to vitamin B12 and makes it absorbable by the small intestine.
7.50.1.6.4.6	Conditions that damage the stomach lining, such as alcoholism or gastritis, can thus lead to pernicious anemia.
7.50.1.6.5.1	Inadequate mineral nutrition can also lead to deficiency diseases.
7.50.1.6.5.2	Examples are hypothyroidism and goiter resulting from iodine deficiency (see Key Concept 40.4), and anemia resulting from iron deficiency.
7.50.1.6.5.3	Iodine deficiency is almost unheard of in the developed world because we add iodide to salt.
7.50.1.6.5.4	However, it is still a major health problem in large segments of the human population.
7.50.1.6.6.1	50.1 recap
7.50.1.6.7.1	As heterotrophs, animals must obtain the energy and molecular building blocks for biosynthesis from their food.
7.50.1.6.7.2	Energy can come from the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.
7.50.1.6.7.3	Molecular building blocks include carbon skeletons, vitamins, and minerals.
7.50.1.6.7.4	Lack of essential nutrients results in deficiency diseases.

7.50.1.6.9.1	You should be able to:
7.50.1.6.10.1	Describe energy storage adaptations in animal species.

7.50.1.6.13.1	Compare water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins and their effects on an animal&#8217;s body.
7.50.1.6.14.1	Gray whales migrate each year from their summer range off Alaska to their winter range off Mexico.
7.50.1.6.14.2	During their migrations and their stay in Mexican waters, they eat very little, if anything.
7.50.1.6.14.3	What is their energy source over this long time, and what are the advantages of this energy source?
7.50.1.6.15.1	Inuit peoples do not eat polar bear liver because it contains so much vitamin A that consuming it produces a serious disease called hypervitaminosis A. Why isn&#8217;t there a disease called hypervitaminosis C?
7.50.1.6.16.1	Anemia is lack of the micronutrient iron.
7.50.1.6.16.2	The incidence of anemia is greater in premenopausal women than in men.
7.50.1.6.16.3	Why?
7.50.1.6.17.1	A comatose patient is fed a nutrient mix through a food tube into the stomach, but a person with a nonfunctional gastrointestinal system will receive a nutrient mix via blood vessels.
7.50.1.6.17.2	Mixes introduced into the stomach include proteins, but mixes delivered into blood vessels do not.
7.50.1.6.17.3	Explain why this is, and what must take the place of proteins in the mix delivered into blood vessels.
7.50.1.6.18.1	We have surveyed the essential elements of nutrition in animals.
7.50.1.6.18.2	Next we will look at various methods and adaptations by which animals obtain the food they need, and the mechanisms they use to extract nutrients from their food.

7.50.1.6.20.1	50.2 Diverse Adaptations Support Ingestion and Digestion of Food
7.50.2.1.1	The food of herbivores is often low in energy and hard to digest
7.50.2.2.1	Carnivores must find, capture, and kill prey
7.50.2.3.1	Vertebrate species have distinctive teeth
7.50.2.4.1	Digestion usually begins in a body cavity
7.50.2.5.1	Tubular guts have an opening at each end
7.50.2.6.1	Digestive enzymes break down complex food molecules
7.50.2.7.1	The gut microbiome contributes to digestion
7.50.2.8.1	Heterotrophic organisms can be classified by how they acquire their nutrition.
7.50.2.8.2	Saprobes (also called saprotrophs) are organisms that absorb nutrients from dead organic matter.
7.50.2.8.3	Most saprobes are either protists or fungi.
7.50.2.8.4	Detritivores, or decomposers, such as earthworms and crabs, actively feed on dead organic material.
7.50.2.8.5	Animals that feed on living organisms are predators: herbivores prey on plants, carnivores prey on animals, and omnivores prey on both.
7.50.2.8.6	Filter feeders, such as clams and blue whales, prey on small organisms by filtering them from the aquatic environment.
7.50.2.8.7	Fluid feeders include mosquitoes, aphids, leeches, and hummingbirds.
7.50.2.8.8	The anatomical adaptations that enable a species to exploit a particular source of nutrition are usually obvious, but physiological and biochemical adaptations are also important.
7.50.2.9.1	focus your learning
7.50.2.10.1	Heterotrophs display a wide diversity of adaptations for acquiring and processing food.
7.50.2.11.1	Digestion occurs in a body cavity where secreted enzymes break down large molecules into small molecules that cells can absorb.
7.50.2.12.1	Heterotrophs rely on symbiotic bacteria residing in their digestive system to carry out essential tasks in digestion.
7.50.2.1.1.1	Most vegetation is coarse, difficult to break down, and has low energy content.
7.50.2.1.1.2	Therefore herbivores spend a great deal of time feeding and processing their food.
7.50.2.1.1.3	Many have striking adaptations for feeding, such as the trunk (a flexible, gripping nose) of the elephant or the huge bill of the fruit-eating toucan, which can be half as long as its body.
7.50.2.1.1.4	Many types of grinding, rasping, cutting, and shredding mouthparts have evolved in invertebrates for ingesting plant material, and the teeth of herbivorous vertebrates have been shaped by selection to tear, crush, and grind coarse plant matter.
7.50.2.1.2.1	The elephant provides an example of the importance of teeth.
7.50.2.1.2.2	Elephants have six chewing teeth per quadrant, which appear one at a time.
7.50.2.1.2.3	The first is present at birth, and subsequent ones appear at the back of the jaw and move forward as the elephant ages.
7.50.2.1.2.4	The first falls out at 2&#8211;3 years of age, the second at 4&#8211;6 years of age, and so forth until the last, and biggest, one (20 cm long and 4 kg) is worn out sometime past 60 years of age.
7.50.2.1.2.5	With the loss of that last tooth, the elephant starves and dies.
7.50.2.1.3.1	The digestive processes of herbivores can be quite specialized.
7.50.2.1.3.2	An example is the koala, which almost exclusively eats leaves of eucalyptus trees.
7.50.2.1.3.3	These leaves are very fibrous, low in usable energy and protein, and high in toxic chemicals.
7.50.2.1.3.4	The koala has strong jaws for grinding the leaves, a very long gut for fermenting them, enzymes in its liver for detoxifying chemicals in the leaves, and a low metabolic rate (i. e. , it expends little energy) to compensate for low energy intake.
7.50.2.2.1.1	The predatory behaviors of many carnivores are legendary&#8212;the hunting skills of hawks, wolves, and tigers, for example.
7.50.2.2.1.2	Carnivores have evolved stealth, speed, power, large jaws, sharp teeth, and strong gripping appendages.
7.50.2.2.1.3	They also have evolved remarkable means of detecting prey.
7.50.2.2.1.4	Bats use echolocation, pit vipers sense infrared radiation from the warm bodies of their prey, and certain fishes detect electric fields created in the water by their prey.
7.50.2.2.1.5	There are many fascinating examples of adaptations for capturing prey, such as the immobilizing venom of many snakes, the long sticky tongues of chameleons, and the webs of spiders.
7.50.2.2.2.1	Some predators digest their prey externally.
7.50.2.2.2.2	For example, a spider injects insect prey with digestive enzymes and then sucks out the liquefied contents, leaving behind the empty exoskeletons frequently seen in old spider webs.
7.50.2.2.2.3	The majority of animals, however, digest their food internally.
7.50.2.2.2.4	For many, the process of digestion begins with the physical breaking down of the food items by the teeth.
7.50.2.3.1.1	Teeth are adapted for the acquisition and initial processing of specific types of foods.
7.50.2.3.1.2	Because they are among the hardest structures of the body, an animal&#0039;s teeth remain in the environment long after it dies.
7.50.2.3.1.3	Paleontologists use teeth to identify animals that lived in the distant past and to deduce their feeding behavior.
7.50.2.3.2.1	In general, teeth of all vertebrates have the same, three-layered structure (Figure 50.6A).
7.50.2.3.2.2	An extremely hard material called enamel, composed principally of calcium phosphate, covers the crown of the tooth.
7.50.2.3.2.3	Both the crown and root contain a layer of bony material called dentine, inside of which is a pulp cavity containing blood vessels, nerves, and the cells that produce the dentine.
7.50.2.3.2.4	Figure 50.6  Mammalian Teeth
7.50.2.3.3.1	There is a great deal of homology in the dentition of mammals, but the shapes and organization of mammalian teeth are adaptations to different diets (Figure 50.6B).
7.50.2.3.3.2	In general, incisors are used for cutting, chopping, and gnawing; canines are used for stabbing, gripping, and ripping; and molars and premolars (the cheek teeth) are used for shearing, crushing, and grinding.
7.50.2.3.3.3	The highly varied diet of humans is reflected in our multipurpose set of teeth, as is common among omnivores.
7.50.2.4.1.1	Animals take food into a body cavity that is continuous with the outside environment.
7.50.2.4.1.2	They secrete digestive enzymes into that cavity, and the enzymes break down the food into nutrient molecules that can be absorbed by the cells lining the cavity.
7.50.2.4.2.1	The simplest digestive system is found in the simplest animals such as sponges.
7.50.2.4.2.2	Water flows from the environment through the body of the sponge in water channels, and individual cells capture food particles from the water (see Figure 30.2B).
7.50.2.4.2.3	A slightly more specialized digestive system is a gastrovascular cavity, which connects to the outside world through a single opening.
7.50.2.4.2.4	Cnidarians, such as jellyfishes, capture prey using stinging nematocysts and use their tentacles to cram the prey into their gastrovascular cavity.
7.50.2.4.2.5	Enzymes in the gastrovascular cavity partially digest the prey.
7.50.2.4.2.6	Cells lining the cavity take in small food particles by endocytosis.
7.50.2.4.2.7	The vesicles created by endocytosis then fuse with lysosomes containing digestive enzymes, and intracellular digestion completes the breakdown of the food.
7.50.2.4.2.8	Nutrients are released to the cytoplasm as the vesicles break down.
7.50.2.5.1.1	Animals classified as bilaterians (see Key Concept 30.1) have a tubular digestive system called a gastrointestinal system or more simply gut.
7.50.2.5.1.2	The gut begins with a mouth that takes in food.
7.50.2.5.1.3	The food is moved through the length of the gut as it is sequentially disassembled or digested, and the smallest units of the digested food are absorbed across the gut wall.
7.50.2.5.1.4	Solid digestive wastes are eliminated through an anus.
7.50.2.5.1.5	Different regions in the tubular gut are specialized for particular functions (Figure 50.7).
7.50.2.5.1.6	These functions must be coordinated so they occur in the proper sequence, and they must be regulated so they occur slowly enough to allow complete digestion but quickly enough to supply the energy needs of the animal.
7.50.2.5.1.7	Figure 50.7 Heterotrophs Get Energy from Autotrophs
7.50.2.5.2.1	In the mouth cavity, food may be physically fragmented by teeth (in many vertebrates), by a radula (in snails), or by mandibles (in many arthropods).
7.50.2.5.2.2	In most birds, food is ground by small stones in an early, muscular portion of the gut called the gizzard.
7.50.2.5.2.3	Some animals, such as snakes, simply ingest whole prey with little or no fragmentation.
7.50.2.5.2.4	Teeth in these species are angled backward to keep the prey moving in only one direction while being slowly swallowed.
7.50.2.5.2.5	Stomachs and crops are storage chambers that enable animals to ingest relatively large amounts of food when it is available, and then digest it gradually.
7.50.2.5.2.6	In these storage chambers, food may be further fragmented and mixed, and in most vertebrates it is an important site of digestion.
7.50.2.5.2.7	Food delivered into the next section of the gut, the intestine, is in small particles, well mixed, and usually partially digested.
7.50.2.5.3.1	Most digestion occurs in the intestine, and nutrients, water, and ions are absorbed across its walls.
7.50.2.5.3.2	Glands secrete digestive enzymes into the intestine, and other enzymes are produced and secreted by cells lining the intestine.
7.50.2.5.3.3	The final segment of the intestine recovers water and ions and stores undigested wastes, or feces, so they can be released to the environment at an appropriate time or place.
7.50.2.5.3.4	A muscular rectum near the anus assists in expelling feces.
7.50.2.5.4.1	In many animals, the parts of the gut that absorb nutrients have greater surface areas than would be expected of a simple tube.
7.50.2.5.4.2	The simplest way to increase the surface area of a tube without changing its diameter is to produce an infolding.
7.50.2.5.4.3	Such an infolding of the gut, called a typhlosole, is seen in earthworms (Figure 50.8A).
7.50.2.5.4.4	Sharks, which have large stomachs but short intestines, have a unique adaptation called a spiral valve (Figure 50.8B).
7.50.2.5.4.5	The lower region of the intestine is enlarged and has an internal structure that forces the food to pass through it in a spiral fashion (like going down a spiral staircase).
7.50.2.5.4.6	The walls of the spiral present a large surface area for absorption of nutrients.
7.50.2.5.4.7	This spiral passage, however, will not accommodate large chunks of food or undigestible matter, so food remains in the stomach for a long time to be broken down, and some larger, undigestible items do not leave the stomach except by regurgitation.
7.50.2.5.4.8	Figure 50.8 Intestinal Surface Area and Nutrient Absorption
7.50.2.5.5.1	In humans, as in most other vertebrates, the wall of the intestine is highly folded, with the individual folds bearing legions of tiny fingerlike projections called villi (Figure 50.8C).
7.50.2.5.5.2	The cells that line the surfaces of the villi, in turn, have microscopic projections called microvilli.
7.50.2.5.5.3	The microvilli give the intestine an enormous internal surface area for absorbing nutrients.
7.50.2.6.1.1	Protein, carbohydrate, and fat macromolecules are broken down into their simplest monomeric units by hydrolytic enzymes produced at different locations in the digestive tract.
7.50.2.6.1.2	Many are secreted into the lumen of the gut, and others remain associated with the membranes of the microvilli.
7.50.2.6.1.3	All of these enzymes cleave the chemical bonds of macromolecules through hydrolysis, a reaction that adds a water molecule (see Figure 3.4B).
7.50.2.6.1.4	Digestive enzymes are classified according to the substances they hydrolyze: proteases break the bonds between adjacent amino acids in proteins; carbohydrases hydrolyze carbohydrates; peptidases break down peptides; lipases, fats; and nucleases, nucleic acids.
7.50.2.6.1.5	We will discuss the digestive enzymes of humans in detail in Key Concept 50.3.
7.50.2.7.1.1	The gut is colonized by a huge population of microorganisms, mostly bacteria.
7.50.2.7.1.2	Collectively the foreign species associated with an organism are called its microbiota, and their cumulative genomes are called the organism&#0039;s microbiome.
7.50.2.7.1.3	The microbiomes of the skin are different from the microbiomes of the mouth, gut, respiratory tract, and urogenital tracts.
7.50.2.7.1.4	The microbiota of the gut obtain their nutrition from the food passing through the gut while contributing to the host&#0039;s digestive processes.
7.50.2.7.1.5	For example, members of the leech genus Hirudo produce no enzymes that can digest the proteins in the blood they suck from vertebrates; instead they depend on bacteria to perform this service.
7.50.2.7.1.6	The resulting amino acids are subsequently used by both the leech and the bacteria.
7.50.2.7.1.7	The microbiota of the human gut also provide important services in digestion, prevent the establishment of harmful microorganisms, and even produce some vitamins (vitamin K and biotin).
7.50.2.7.1.8	It is estimated that the human body consists of 1013 cells, but our guts contain probably ten times that number of unicellular organisms representing at least 500 different species (see Figure 25.19).
7.50.2.7.1.9	Recent studies have revealed that gut microbiomes are not constant, but are influenced by diet and other factors, including medications we ingest.
7.50.2.7.1.10	The effects of different microbiomes may go far beyond simply facilitating digestion (Investigating Life: How Does the Gut Microbiome Contribute to Obesity and Metabolic Disease?).

7.50.2.7.6.1	Fats differ in fatty acid composition, and fatty acids differ in the number of single or double bonds between their carbon atoms (see Key Concept 3.4).
7.50.2.7.6.2	Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds, and unsaturated fatty acids do.
7.50.2.7.6.3	Diets rich in saturated fatty acids are implicated in several health concerns, but what is it about saturated fatty acids that is unhealthy?

7.50.2.7.9.1	Raise two groups of 15 mice on isocaloric diets rich in saturated fats (lard) or unsaturated fats (fish oil).
7.50.2.7.10.1	Each week, record the mice&#0039;s body weight.
7.50.2.7.11.1	At the end of 11 weeks, compare the mice&#0039;s (1) microbiomes, by sequencing the ribosomal RNA genes, and (2) body weight gain.
7.50.2.7.12.1	CONCLUSIONS
7.50.2.7.13.1	The fat composition of the diet influenced the composition of the microbiome.
7.50.2.7.14.1	Mice on the diet containing saturated fats gained more weight and gained weight faster than mice on the isocaloric diet containing unsaturated fats.
7.50.2.7.15.1	RESULTS
7.50.2.7.16.1	work with the data
7.50.2.7.17.1	The researchers hypothesized that mice consuming more saturated fats will have a higher probability of becoming obese and developing symptoms of diabetes.
7.50.2.7.17.2	To test for dietary effects on the development of metabolic disease, the researchers collected additional data from the two cohorts of mice: fasting blood glucose levels and fasting blood insulin levels.
7.50.2.7.17.3	They also did an insulin tolerance test (effect of a dose of insulin on blood glucose level).
7.50.2.7.17.4	Data are reported as means (&#0177; SEM).
7.50.2.7.18.1	QUESTIONS
7.50.2.7.19.1	Using a t-test, determine whether the difference in the fasting blood glucose levels for the lard-fed and fish-oil-fed mice is significant.
7.50.2.7.20.1	Using a t-test, determine whether the difference in the fasting blood insulin levels for the lard-fed and fish-oil-fed mice is significant.

7.50.2.7.24.1	50.2 recap
7.50.2.7.25.1	Heterotrophs have diverse adaptations for acquiring food.
7.50.2.7.25.2	Once captured or ingested, food is digested extracellularly by secreted enzymes to release nutrients that are absorbed into the animal&#0039;s body, usually via a tubular gut.
7.50.2.7.25.3	The gut microbiome plays a role in digestion.
7.50.2.7.26.1	learning outcomes
7.50.2.7.27.1	You should be able to:
7.50.2.7.28.1	Compare the feeding and digestive adaptations of different species.
7.50.2.7.29.1	Relate structural features of animal guts to their functions and adaptive significance in digestion.
7.50.2.7.30.1	Describe digestive enzymes that are present in animal guts.
7.50.2.7.31.1	Explain the importance of the microbiome in the digestion of food.
7.50.2.7.32.1	Why do herbivores typically spend more time feeding than do carnivores?
7.50.2.7.33.1	What do the actions of all digestive enzymes have in common?
7.50.2.7.34.1	Why is it common for individuals to have digestive problems after antibiotic therapy?
7.50.2.7.35.1	When people with celiac disease eat food containing gluten, their immune system damages their intestinal villi.
7.50.2.7.35.2	If undiagnosed, such people are likely to experience bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatty stool, loss of body weight, and iron deficiency.
7.50.2.7.35.3	Why do these symptoms occur?
7.50.2.7.36.1	Once ingested by an animal, food may be fragmented and moved into the gut for digestion by hydrolytic enzymes.
7.50.2.7.36.2	The processes of digestion release nutrients that are absorbed into the animal&#0039;s body.
7.50.2.7.36.3	Next we will focus on how those processes occur in vertebrates.
7.50.2.7.37.1	Chapter 50 continues with
7.50.2.7.38.1	50.3 The Vertebrate Gastrointestinal System Is a Disassembly Line
7.50.3.1.1	The vertebrate gut consists of concentric tissue layers
7.50.3.2.1	Gut motility moves food through the gut and aids digestion
7.50.3.3.1	Chemical digestion begins in the mouth and the stomach
7.50.3.4.1	The stomach gradually releases its contents to the small intestine
7.50.3.5.1	Most chemical digestion occurs in the small intestine
7.50.3.6.1	Nutrients are absorbed in the small intestine
7.50.3.7.1	Absorbed nutrients go to the liver
7.50.3.8.1	Water and ions are absorbed in the large intestine
7.50.3.9.1	Herbivores rely on their microbiota to digest cellulose
7.50.3.10.1	Digestion in vertebrates occurs in the gastrointestinal system, which includes a tubular gut running from mouth to anus and several accessory structures that produce secretions that play important roles in digestion (Figure 50.9).
7.50.3.10.2	In this section we consider three important processes of this system: the movement of food through it, the sequential steps of digestion, and the absorption of nutrients.
7.50.3.10.3	We use as our primary example a typical vertebrate, the human.
7.50.3.10.4	Figure 50.9 The Human Digestive System
7.50.3.11.1	focus your learning
7.50.3.12.1	The structure of the vertebrate gut supports its digestive function.
7.50.3.13.1	A variety of chemical and physical processes take place in different parts of the digestive system to efficiently break down food into forms that the body can use.
7.50.3.14.1	Herbivores do not produce the cellulases needed to digest cellulose in their plant diet, and thus require microbiota to carry out this task.
7.50.3.1.1.1	Tissues of the vertebrate gut are arranged in concentric layers that have a similar organization throughout its length (Figure 50.10).
7.50.3.1.1.2	The mucosa lines the internal cavity, or lumen, of the gut.
7.50.3.1.1.3	The  mucosa consists of delicate epithelial cells with underlying connective tissue.
7.50.3.1.1.4	Some cells of this mucosal epithelium secrete mucus to lubricate and protect the walls of the gut; some secrete digestive enzymes; and some secrete hormones.
7.50.3.1.1.5	Mucosal epithelial cells in the stomach secrete hydrochloric acid, and as we noted in Key Concept 50.1, some secrete intrinsic factor to aid the absorption of vitamin B12.
7.50.3.1.1.6	In some regions of the gut, nutrients are absorbed by mucosal epithelial cells.
7.50.3.1.1.7	The apical cell membranes of these absorptive cells have microvilli that increase the surface area over which absorption can take place (see Figure 50.8C).
7.50.3.1.1.8	Figure 50.10 Tissue Layers of the Vertebrate Gut
7.50.3.1.2.1	At the base of the mucosa there is a thin layer of smooth muscle cells with random orientations.
7.50.3.1.2.2	The function of this cell layer is to move the mucosal epithelium to maximize its contact with the gut contents.
7.50.3.1.2.3	Just under the mucosa is the submucosal tissue layer where blood and lymph vessels pick up nutrients to transport to the rest of the body.
7.50.3.1.2.4	The submucosa also contains a network of nerves; the neurons in this network have sensory functions (responsible for stomach aches) and also control various secretory functions of the gut.
7.50.3.1.3.1	External to the submucosa are two layers of smooth muscle responsible for large movements of the gut.
7.50.3.1.3.2	Innermost is the circular muscle layer, with its cells oriented around the gut.
7.50.3.1.3.3	Outermost is the longitudinal muscle layer, with its cells oriented along the length of the gut (see Figure 50.10).
7.50.3.1.3.4	The circular muscles constrict the gut, and the longitudinal muscles shorten it.
7.50.3.1.3.5	Between the two layers of smooth muscle is another nerve network that controls and coordinates the movements of the gut.
7.50.3.1.3.6	The coordinated activity of the two smooth muscle layers mixes contents of the gut and moves it continuously toward the anus.
7.50.3.1.4.1	Nerve nets in the submucosa and between the smooth muscle layers are called the enteric nervous system, and they are unusual.
7.50.3.1.4.2	The cell bodies of most peripheral nerves are in the central nervous system (CNS)&#8212;in the brain or spinal cord.
7.50.3.1.4.3	The only exceptions are the postganglionic cells of the autonomic nervous system and the cells of the enteric nervous system.
7.50.3.1.4.4	In addition, most neurons of the peripheral nervous system either receive synapses from neurons in the CNS or contribute synapses to neurons in the CNS.
7.50.3.1.4.5	In contrast, most of the neurons in the enteric nervous system form synapses only with other neurons in their network.
7.50.3.1.4.6	Thus they are responsible for communication within the gut.
7.50.3.1.4.7	The CNS can influence activity in the enteric nervous system and receive information from it, but the gut truly has &#8220;a mind of its own. &#8221;
7.50.3.1.5.1	A tissue membrane called the peritoneum surrounds the gut and most of the organs of the abdominal cavity as well as lining the wall of the cavity.
7.50.3.1.5.2	The peritoneum includes connective and epithelial tissues that secrete a lubricating fluid that enables the organs to easily slide against each other in the body cavity.
7.50.3.2.1.1	In humans and most other mammals, food is chewed in the mouth and mixed with saliva.
7.50.3.2.1.2	Periodically the tongue pushes a bolus (mass) of the chewed food toward the throat.
7.50.3.2.1.3	By making contact with the soft palate at the back of the mouth cavity, the food bolus initiates swallowing, which is a complex series of reflexes.
7.50.3.2.1.4	Swallowing propels the food through the pharynx (where the mouth cavity and nasal passages join) and into the esophagus (food tube).
7.50.3.2.1.5	To prevent food from entering the trachea (windpipe), the larynx (voice box) closes, and a flap of tissue called the epiglottis covers the entrance to the larynx (Figure 50.11A).
7.50.3.2.1.6	Figure 50.11 Swallowing and Peristalsis
7.50.3.2.2.1	Once a bolus of food enters the esophagus, it is moved toward the stomach both by gravity and by waves of muscle contraction called peristalsis (Figure 50.11B).
7.50.3.2.2.2	The muscle of the upper region of the esophagus is striated (i. e. , skeletal muscle) and is controlled by the CNS reflexes of swallowing.
7.50.3.2.2.3	The muscles of the rest of the esophagus are smooth muscles controlled by the autonomic and enteric nervous systems.
7.50.3.2.3.1	Smooth muscles of the gut contract in response to being stretched (see Figure 47.8).
7.50.3.2.3.2	When a bolus of food reaches the smooth muscle region of the esophagus and stretches it, the muscle responds by contracting, thus pushing food toward the stomach.
7.50.3.2.3.3	Why doesn&#0039;t the contraction of the esophageal smooth muscle push food back toward the mouth?
7.50.3.2.3.4	The nerve net between the two smooth muscle layers coordinates the muscles so that when a region of the gut smooth muscle contracts, the circular smooth muscle just beyond it relaxes.
7.50.3.2.3.5	This action, controlled by the enteric nervous system, is called an anticipatory wave of relaxation.
7.50.3.2.3.6	The contractions of smooth muscles behind the relaxing area push food into it&#8212;in the direction of the anus.
7.50.3.2.3.7	The resulting stretch of that region stimulates its circular smooth muscle to contract as the anticipatory wave of relaxation causes the smooth muscle of the next region to relax.
7.50.3.2.3.8	The peristaltic waves of contraction and relaxation of the gut smooth muscle move food along the gut from the mouth to the anus.
7.50.3.2.4.1	At the junction of the esophagus and stomach is an esophageal sphincter, a ring of circular smooth muscle that is normally constricted.
7.50.3.2.4.2	Waves of peristalsis cause the sphincter to relax enough to let food pass from the esophagus into the stomach.
7.50.3.2.4.3	Sphincter muscles are found throughout the digestive tract: the pyloric sphincter governs the passage of stomach contents into the small intestine; the ileocaecal sphincter controls the flow of food between the small and large intestines; and the anal sphincter relaxes to allow defecation.
7.50.3.2.5.1	Some movements of the stomach are not as coordinated as the peristaltic movements of the esophagus and serve to move the contents of the stomach around and mix them with the digestive juices.
7.50.3.2.5.2	However, peristaltic waves of contraction reorganize in the lower region of the stomach and push the semidigested material up against the pyloric sphincter which controls the opening to the small intestine.
7.50.3.2.5.3	In the small intestine, peristalitic activity continues to move the gut contents toward the large intestine.
7.50.3.3.1.1	Salivary glands secrete the enzyme amylase into the mouth where it is mixed with the food being chewed.
7.50.3.3.1.2	Amylase hydrolyzes bonds between glucose monomers that make up carbohydrate molecules.
7.50.3.3.1.3	The action of amylase is what makes a chewed piece of bread or cracker taste slightly sweet if you hold it in your mouth long enough.
7.50.3.3.2.1	The main role of the stomach is to store food and deliver it gradually to the small intestine so that digestion can occur more slowly than ingestion.
7.50.3.3.2.2	The stomach produces secretions that facilitate digestion and also kill potential pathogens that are ingestsed with food.
7.50.3.3.2.3	Gastric pits in the stomach walls (Figure 50.12A and B) have three types of secretory cells: (1) mucus secreting cells, (2) parietal cells that secrete hydrocholoric acid (HCl), and (3) chief cells that secrete the inactive proteolytic enzyme pepsinogen (Figure 50.12C).
7.50.3.3.2.4	The low pH of the stomach juices has multiple functions.
7.50.3.3.2.5	It kills most microorganisms that are ingested with food; it denatures proteins, making them more accessible to the hydrolytic actions of pepsin; and it converts pepsinogen to pepsin by cleaving away a sequence of amino acids that masks the active site of the enzyme.
7.50.3.3.2.6	Newly activated pepsin activates other pepsinogen molecules, creating a positive feedback process called autocatalysis.
7.50.3.3.2.7	Acid and the proteolytic enzyme pepsin could damage the stomach walls, but the mucus-secreting cells provide a protective coating for the walls of the gastric pits and stomach.
7.50.3.3.2.8	Figure 50.12 Action in the Stomach
7.50.3.3.3.1	The production of hydrochloric acid (HCl) by the parietal cells of the gastric pits is quite impressive.
7.50.3.3.3.2	It amounts to about 2 liters per day&#8212;enough to bring the pH of the stomach contents below 1, which is the same as battery acid and ten times more acidic than pure lemon juice.
7.50.3.3.3.3	This means that across their cell membranes, parietal cells create a H+ ion concentration difference of 3 million-fold.
7.50.3.3.3.4	Such a feat of transport is not seen anywhere else in the body.
7.50.3.3.3.5	How do the gastric pits do it?
7.50.3.3.3.6	Enzymes and transporters are involved.
7.50.3.3.4.1	The enzyme carbonic anhydrase in parietal cells catalyzes the hydration of CO2 to H2CO3, which dissociates into H+ and bicarbonate ion (HCO3&#8722;).
7.50.3.3.4.2	An antiporter transport protein (see Figure 6.13) exchanges HCO3&#8722; for Cl&#8722; on the blood side of the gastric pits, and an antiporter on the gastric pit side exchanges H+ for K+ (Figure 50.12D).
7.50.3.3.4.3	However, K+ leaks out of the parietal cell down its concentration gradient.
7.50.3.3.4.4	Thus the inward transport of K+ acts like an endless conveyer belt moving H+ out into the stomach lumen.
7.50.3.3.4.5	Cl&#8722; also passively leaks out of the gastric lumen side of the parietal cells to maintain electrical neutrality.
7.50.3.4.1.1	The acidic, fluid mixture of gastric juice and partly digested food in the stomach is called chyme.
7.50.3.4.1.2	A few substances can be absorbed across the stomach wall, including alcohol (hence its rapid effects), aspirin, and caffeine, but even these substances are absorbed in rather small quantities from the stomach; most absorption takes place in the small intestine.
7.50.3.4.1.3	At the bottom of the stomach, peristaltic contractions push the chyme up against the pyloric sphincter.
7.50.3.4.1.4	Associated waves of anticipatory relaxation cause the pyloric sphincter to relax briefly so that little squirts of chyme enter the small intestine.
7.50.3.4.1.5	The human stomach empties gradually over a period of approximately 4 hours.
7.50.3.4.1.6	This slow introduction of food into the small intestine enables it to work on a little material at a time.
7.50.3.5.1.1	In the small intestine, digestion of carbohydrates and proteins continues, and digestion of fats and absorption of nutrients begin.
7.50.3.5.1.2	The small intestine takes its name from its diameter; it is in fact a very large organ, about 6 meters long in an adult human.
7.50.3.5.1.3	Given its length and the folds, villi, and microvilli of its epithelial cells, its inner surface area is roughly the size of a tennis court.
7.50.3.5.1.4	Across this surface the small intestine absorbs the nutrient molecules derived from food.
7.50.3.5.2.1	The small intestine of humans has three sections.
7.50.3.5.2.2	The initial section (about 25 cm long) is called the duodenum and is the site of most digestion; the jejunum and the ileum (together about 600 cm) carry out 90 percent of the absorption of nutrients (see Figure 50.9).
7.50.3.5.3.1	Digestion in the small intestine involves many specialized enzymes, as well as several other secretions.
7.50.3.5.3.2	Two accessory organs that are not part of the digestive tract&#8212;the liver and the pancreas&#8212;produce most of these secretions and deliver them to the lumen of the intestine through ducts.
7.50.3.5.1.1.1	The liver synthesizes bile from cholesterol.
7.50.3.5.1.1.2	Bile also includes other substances, such as phospholipids and bilirubin (the breakdown product of hemoglobin).
7.50.3.5.1.1.3	Bile flows from the liver through the hepatic duct.
7.50.3.5.1.1.4	A side branch off the hepatic duct called the cystic duct goes to the gallbladder, where bile is stored.
7.50.3.5.1.1.5	Below this junction, the hepatic duct is called the common bile duct.
7.50.3.5.1.1.6	Before it reaches the duodenum, the common bile duct is joined by the pancreatic duct (Figure 50.13).
7.50.3.5.1.1.7	Figure 50.13 Ducts of the Gallbladder and Pancreas
7.50.3.5.1.2.1	Fat entering the duodenum stimulates cells of the duodenal epithelium to release the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK), which stimulates the walls of the gallbladder to contract rhythmically.
7.50.3.5.1.2.2	As a result, bile is squeezed out of the gallbladder and through the cystic duct to the common bile duct.
7.50.3.5.1.2.3	Peristalsis moves the bile down the bile duct, and a small sphincter at the junction of the common bile duct with the duodenum relaxes in response to waves of peristalsis and allows squirts of bile to enter the duodenal lumen.
7.50.3.5.1.3.1	To understand the role of bile in fat digestion, think of an oil-and-vinegar salad dressing.
7.50.3.5.1.3.2	Oil is hydrophobic and tends to aggregate in large globules.
7.50.3.5.1.3.3	For that reason, many salad dressings include an emulsifier&#8212;something that prevents oil droplets from aggregating.
7.50.3.5.1.3.4	Mayonnaise, for example, is oil and vinegar with egg yolk added as an emulsifier.
7.50.3.5.1.3.5	Bile emulsifies fats in the chyme.
7.50.3.5.1.3.6	One end of each bile molecule is lipophilic (soluble in fat), and the other end is hydrophilic (soluble in water).
7.50.3.5.1.3.7	The lipophilic ends of bile molecules merge with the fat droplets, leaving their hydrophilic ends sticking out.
7.50.3.5.1.3.8	As a result, bile prevents small fat droplets from congealing together into large fat droplets, and thereby the surface area of the fats exposed to the fat-digesting enzymes (lipases) is greatly enlarged.
7.50.3.5.1.3.9	The very small fat particles that result from emulsification by bile are called micelles (Figure 50.14A).
7.50.3.5.1.3.10	Figure 50.14 Digesting Fats
7.50.3.5.1.4.1	Q: A small percentage of people who have had their gallbladders removed must thereafter eat a low-fat diet, or they will experience diarrhea.
7.50.3.5.1.4.2	Why?
7.50.3.5.2.1.1	The pancreas is a large gland that lies just behind and below the stomach (see Figures 50.9 and 50.13).
7.50.3.5.2.1.2	It is both an endocrine gland (secreting hormones into the circulation; see Key Concept 40.1) and an exocrine gland (secreting digestive juices through the pancreatic duct to the gut lumen).
7.50.3.5.2.1.3	The exocrine tissues of the pancreas produce a host of digestive enzymes, including lipases, amylases, proteases, and nucleases (Table 50.3).
7.50.3.5.2.1.4	As in the stomach, the protease enzymes are released in inactive forms called zymogens; if proteases were not in this inactive state, they would digest the pancreas and its ducts before ever reaching the duodenum.
7.50.3.5.2.1.5	Once in the duodenum, the zymogen trypsinogen is activated by the enzyme enterokinase (secreted by cells lining the duodenum) to produce the active protease trypsin.
7.50.3.5.2.1.6	Trypsin cleaves other zymogens, releasing other proteases as well as more active trypsin.

7.50.3.5.2.3.1	The mixture of zymogens produced by the pancreas can be dangerous if the pancreatic duct is blocked or if the pancreas is injured by infection or physical trauma such as a blow to the abdomen.
7.50.3.5.2.3.2	A few activated trypsin molecules can initiate a chain reaction of enzyme activity that digests the tissues of the pancreas (a condition called pancreatitis), destroying both its endocrine and exocrine functions.
7.50.3.5.2.4.1	The ducts of the pancreas produce a secretion rich in bicarbonate ions (HCO3&#8722;).
7.50.3.5.2.4.2	Bicarbonate ions are alkaline (basic) and neutralize the acidic pH of the chyme that enters the duodenum from the stomach.
7.50.3.5.2.4.3	Intestinal enzymes function best at a neutral or slightly alkaline pH.
7.50.3.5.2.4.4	The production of bicarbonate and its secretion into the pancreatic ducts is similar to the production of H+ ions and their secretion into the gastric pits&#8212;but with opposite spatial orientations.
7.50.3.5.2.4.5	In both types of secretory cells, carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the hydration of CO2 to produce H2CO3 that dissociates into H+ and HCO3&#8722; ions.
7.50.3.5.2.4.6	Whereas in the gastric pit the H+ is secreted into the lumen of the pit, in the pancreatic duct it is the HCO3&#8722; that is secreted into the lumen, and the H+ is transported into the circulation.
7.50.3.6.1.1	The final step in digesting proteins and carbohydrates and absorbing their components occurs among the intestinal microvilli.
7.50.3.6.1.2	Mucosal epithelial cells produce peptidases that cleave small peptides into absorbable amino acids.
7.50.3.6.1.3	These epithelial cells also produce the enzymes maltase, lactase, and sucrase that cleave the common disaccharides into absorbable monosaccharides&#8212;glucose, galactose, and fructose.
7.50.3.6.1.4	There is also some lipase activity for fat digestion.
7.50.3.6.2.1	Many humans stop producing the enzyme lactase in childhood and thereafter have difficulty digesting lactose (the sugar in milk).
7.50.3.6.2.2	Lactose is a disaccharide and cannot be absorbed without being cleaved into its constituents, glucose and galactose.
7.50.3.6.2.3	Unabsorbed lactose is metabolized by bacteria in the large intestine, causing gas, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps.
7.50.3.6.3.1	The mechanisms by which cells of the intestinal epithelium absorb nutrients and inorganic ions are diverse and include diffusion, facilitated diffusion, active transport, and secondary active transport.
7.50.3.6.3.2	Many inorganic ions such as sodium, calcium, and iron are actively transported by these cells.
7.50.3.6.3.3	For example, active Na+ transporters exist on the basal and lateral sides of the epithelial cells.
7.50.3.6.3.4	They maintain a low concentration of Na+ in those cells so that Na+ can diffuse in from the chyme in the intestinal lumen.
7.50.3.6.3.5	About 30 grams of Na+ are transported this way every day, and Cl&#8722; follows.
7.50.3.6.4.1	The transport of Na+ and other ions is important for water absorption because it creates an osmotic concentration gradient.
7.50.3.6.4.2	At least 7&#8211;8 liters of water per day move through the spaces between the epithelial cells in response to this osmotic gradient.
7.50.3.6.4.3	Because the water moves through spaces between the cells and not through the cells themselves, it can carry with it nutrients that are in solution&#8212;a transport mechanism called solvent drag or bulk transport.
7.50.3.6.5.1	Many different kinds of transport proteins function in epithelial cell membranes.
7.50.3.6.5.2	Some, such as the transport protein for fructose, only facilitate diffusion, and that requires a concentration gradient.
7.50.3.6.5.3	Once fructose enters the cell it is converted to glucose, so the concentration of fructose in the cell is always low and the concentration gradient is maintained.
7.50.3.6.5.4	Transport proteins known as symporters (see Figure 6.13) exploit the concentration gradient of Na+ between the inside and outside of the cell that is maintained by the Na+&#8211;K+ pump common to all cells (see Figure 6.14).
7.50.3.6.5.5	Symporters combine the transport of Na+ and another molecule, such as glucose, galactose, or an amino acid.
7.50.3.6.5.6	As Na+ moves down its concentration gradient into the cell, the &#8220;hitchhiking&#8221; molecules are carried along with it.
7.50.3.6.6.1	The absorption of the products of fat digestion is relatively simple.
7.50.3.6.6.2	Triglycerides are hydrolyzed to diglycerides, monoglycerides, and fatty acids, all of which are lipid-soluble and thus able to pass through the cell membranes of the microvilli.
7.50.3.6.6.3	In the intestinal epithelial cells, these molecules are resynthesized into triglycerides, combined with cholesterol and phospholipids, and coated with protein to form water-soluble chylomicrons (Figure 50.14B).
7.50.3.6.6.4	Rather than enter the blood directly, chylomicrons pass into blind-ended lymph vessels called lacteals that are inside each villus (see Figure 50.8C).
7.50.3.6.6.5	They then flow through the lymphatic system, entering the bloodstream through the thoracic ducts at the base of the neck.
7.50.3.6.6.6	After a meal rich in fats, chylomicrons can be so abundant in the blood that they give the blood plasma a milky appearance.
7.50.3.6.6.7	Chylomicrons deliver their triglyceride and cholesterol cargo as they circulate through tissues.
7.50.3.6.7.1	The bile molecules that emulsify fats are not absorbed along with the monoglycerides, diglycerides, and the fatty acids, but are shuttled back and forth between the gut contents and the microvilli.
7.50.3.6.7.2	In the ileum, bile is actively reabsorbed and returned to the liver via the bloodstream.
7.50.3.7.1.1	Blood leaving the digestive tract flows to the liver in the hepatic portal vein.
7.50.3.7.1.2	This large vein delivers the blood to small spaces called sinusoids between groups of liver cells.
7.50.3.7.1.3	These cells absorb the nutrients coming from the digestive tract and either store them or convert them to molecules the body needs.
7.50.3.7.1.4	Glucose, galactose, and fructose are used to synthesize glycogen.
7.50.3.7.1.5	Amino acids are used to build proteins.
7.50.3.7.1.6	Lipids from the chylomicrons are either stored as triglycerides or used to make lipoproteins, which are released by the liver and carry the triglycerides and cholesterol to other tissues (as we will discuss in Key Concept 50.4).
7.50.3.8.1.1	The motility of the small intestine gradually pushes its contents through another sphincter&#8212;the ileocaecal sphincter&#8212;and into the large intestine, or colon.
7.50.3.8.1.2	Most of the available nutrients have been removed from the chyme that enters the colon, but it contains a lot of water and inorganic ions.
7.50.3.8.1.3	A major type of motility in the colon is called segmentation movements.
7.50.3.8.1.4	These movements are mostly due to contractions of circular muscles that repeatedly divide the colon into separate segments.
7.50.3.8.1.5	Functionally, segmentation movements cause the chyme to slosh around in the colon and promote absorption of ions and water by increasing contact between the chyme and the epithelium of the colon.
7.50.3.8.1.6	As ions and water are absorbed, the chyme becomes a semisolid mass that forms feces.
7.50.3.8.1.7	Absorption of too much water from the colon can cause hard feces and constipation.
7.50.3.8.1.8	The opposite condition, diarrhea, results if too little water is absorbed.
7.50.3.8.1.9	Excessive diarrhea caused by diseases such as cholera can produce such rapid loss of water and electrolytes that death can occur in hours.
7.50.3.8.1.10	Simple rehydration therapy with electrolytes can save lives.
7.50.3.8.2.1	Fecal matter is stored in the descending colon and in the rectum until defecation occurs.
7.50.3.8.2.2	This is usually once a day and is preceded by strong peristaltic activity.
7.50.3.8.2.3	The distension of the walls of the rectum by fecal matter initiates a parasympathetic reflex, causing the rectal muscle to contract and the internal anal sphincter to relax.
7.50.3.8.2.4	In addition, there is an external anal sphincter that is under conscious control so that defecation is not entirely an involuntary act.
7.50.3.9.1.1	Cellulose is the primary component of plant cell walls, and is therefore the principal component of the food of herbivores.
7.50.3.9.1.2	Most herbivores, however, cannot produce cellulases, the enzymes that break down cellulose.
7.50.3.9.1.3	(Exceptions include earthworms, shipworms, and the silverfish that eat books and stored papers. )
7.50.3.9.1.4	From termites to cattle, herbivores rely on the microbiota of their digestive tracts to digest cellulose.
7.50.3.9.2.1	Ruminants (cud chewers) such as cattle ferment their plant-based food in special stomachs before digestion.
7.50.3.9.2.2	Their stomachs are large, four-chambered organs (Figure 50.15).
7.50.3.9.2.3	The first two chambers, the rumen and the reticulum, are packed with endosymbiotic microorganisms that break down cellulose by fermentation.
7.50.3.9.2.4	The ruminant periodically regurgitates the contents of the rumen (the cud) into the mouth for more chewing.
7.50.3.9.2.5	When swallowed again, the vegetal fibers present more surface area to the microorganisms.
7.50.3.9.2.6	The microorganisms metabolize cellulose and other nutrients to simple fatty acids, which are nutrients for their host.
7.50.3.9.2.7	Figure 50.15 A Ruminant&#0039;s Stomach
7.50.3.9.3.1	Enormous numbers of microorganisms leave the rumen along with the partially digested food.
7.50.3.9.3.2	This mass is concentrated by water absorption in the omasum before it enters the true stomach, the abomasum, where the microorganisms are killed by secreted hydrochloric acid, partially digested by proteases, and passed on to the small intestine for further digestion and absorption.
7.50.3.9.3.3	A cow derives more than 100 grams of protein per day from digestion of its microbiota.
7.50.3.9.3.4	The rate of multiplication of microorganisms in the rumen offsets their loss, so a well-balanced, mutually beneficial relationship is maintained.
7.50.3.9.4.1	Some mammalian herbivores have a microbial fermentation chamber called a cecum extending from the large intestine.
7.50.3.9.4.2	An example is the rabbit (see Figure 50.7).
7.50.3.9.4.3	Since the cecum empties into the large intestine, absorption of nutrients produced by the microorganisms in the cecum is inefficient because of the limited surface area of the large intestine.
7.50.3.9.4.4	Such species frequently produce two kinds of feces&#8212;ones that are pure waste and ones that contain cecal material.
7.50.3.9.4.5	In a behavior known as coprophagy, these species reingest the cecal feces directly from the anus so they can digest and absorb the nutrients that would otherwise be lost.
7.50.3.9.4.6	In humans the cecum is small and ends in the vestigial appendix which serves no digestive function.
7.50.3.9.5.1	50.3 recap
7.50.3.9.6.1	The vertebrate gastrointestinal system is a tubular gut that is adapted to ingest food, fragment it, digest it, and absorb nutrients.
7.50.3.9.6.2	Peristalsis moves food through the gut.
7.50.3.9.6.3	Segmentation movements mix the gut contents.
7.50.3.9.6.4	Enzymatic digestion followed by absorption of nutrients occur mostly in the small intestine; water and ions are absorbed in the large intestine.
7.50.3.9.7.1	learning outcomes
7.50.3.9.8.1	You should be able to:
7.50.3.9.9.1	Explain the mechanisms that move food through the vertebrate digestive system.
7.50.3.9.10.1	Describe the role of acid and how it is produced in the stomach.
7.50.3.9.11.1	Discuss autocatalysis and its role in digestion.
7.50.3.9.12.1	Explain how bile assists in digestion.
7.50.3.9.13.1	Explain observations about the presence of microorganisms found in the digestive tracts of herbivores.
7.50.3.9.14.1	Compare the roles of microbiota in the digestive systems of different vertebrates.
7.50.3.9.15.1	Explain why in the weightlessness of space, food still travels from the mouth to the stomach.
7.50.3.9.16.1	When some biochemists ground up a piece of stomach wall and stimulated it with the hormone that causes the stomach to secrete HCl, no change in the pH of the solution occurred.
7.50.3.9.16.2	Why not?
7.50.3.9.17.1	How does bile assist in the digestion of fats, and why aren&#0039;t equivalent molecules necessary to facilitate transport of lipids in the lymph and blood?
7.50.3.9.18.1	Explain why the gut microbiota is a significant source of nutrition for ruminants but not for humans.
7.50.3.9.19.1	Explain why in the ruminant digestive systyem HC1 is secreted in the abomasum but not in the rumen, the reticulum, or the omasum.
7.50.3.9.20.1	Why would the autocatalytic property of pepsin foster a positive feedback mechanism of protein hydrolysis in the stomach?
7.50.3.9.21.1	The steps included in the ingestion and digestion of food&#8212;from fragmentation in the mouth to the digestive processes in the stomach and intestines&#8212;make the nutrients in food available for absorption and ultimately for metabolism.
7.50.3.9.21.2	We will look next at how the processes of digestion are controlled and how nutrients are handled by the body once food has been digested.
7.50.3.9.22.1	Chapter 50 continues with
7.50.3.9.23.1	50.4 Nutrient Availability Is Controlled and Regulated
7.50.4.1.1	Hormones control many digestive functions
7.50.4.2.1	The liver stores and releases the molecules that fuel metabolism
7.50.4.3.1	The liver produces lipoproteins: the good, the bad, and the ugly
7.50.4.4.1	Insulin and glucagon control fuel metabolism
7.50.4.5.1	The brain plays a major role in regulating food intake
7.50.4.6.1	As we indicated earlier, the vertebrate gut is a disassembly line, and as with a standard assembly line, the control and coordination of the sequential processes of digestion are critical.
7.50.4.6.2	Both neuronal and hormonal controls govern these processes.
7.50.4.6.3	Once the products of digestion are absorbed, their availability to the cells of the body must also be controlled and regulated.
7.50.4.7.1	focus your learning
7.50.4.8.1	Hormones control actions of the digestive tract and its accessory organs.
7.50.4.9.1	The liver interconverts and stores fuel molecules.
7.50.4.10.1	The liver controls fat metabolism through its production of lipoproteins, which move fats between storage and production sites.
7.50.4.11.1	The pancreas secretes hormones that help control glucose levels in the blood.
7.50.4.12.1	Body mass and food intake behavior are influenced by stimulatory and inhibitory hormones that activate neurons in the arcuate nucleus region of the hypothalamus in the brain.
7.50.4.13.1	Your salivation at the sight or smell of food is an autonomic reflex, as is swallowing.
7.50.4.13.2	Other autonomic reflexes include the release of digestive juices and increased stomach motility stimulated by good food smells, as well as gagging at the smell of rotting meat.
7.50.4.13.3	These reflexes are called the &#8220;cephalic phase&#8221; of control of digestive processes because they involve the CNS.
7.50.4.13.4	Most of the control of digestive processes, however, involves neural and hormonal mechanisms that are intrinsic to the gut.
7.50.4.14.1	Neuronal messages travel from one region of the digestive tract to another in the enteric nervous system.
7.50.4.14.2	One function of the gut&#0039;s nervous system is coordinating the movement of food through the gut.
7.50.4.14.3	Of course, this intrinsic nervous system communicates information to the CNS and receives input from the CNS, but its most important role is to coordinate actions throughout the digestive tract.
7.50.4.14.4	In spite of this marvelous intrinsic nervous system, however, much of the control and regulation of the digestive system and nutrient management involves hormonal mechanisms.
7.50.4.1.1.1	Several hormones control the activities of the digestive tract and its accessory organs (Figure 50.16).
7.50.4.1.1.2	The first hormone ever discovered came from the duodenum; it was called secretin because it causes the pancreas to secrete digestive juices.
7.50.4.1.1.3	We now know that secretin is only one of several hormones that control pancreatic secretion; specifically, secretin stimulates the cells of the pancreatic ducts to secrete a solution rich in bicarbonate ions.
7.50.4.1.1.4	Figure 50.16 Hormones Control Digestion
7.50.4.1.2.1	The stimulus that causes the duodenum to release secretin is low pH caused by the arrival of acidic chyme from the stomach.
7.50.4.1.2.2	Similarly, the presence of fats and proteins in the chyme stimulates the release of cholecystokinin (CCK), the hormone that stimulates the gallbladder to release bile.
7.50.4.1.2.3	CCK also stimulates the pancreas to release digestive enzymes.
7.50.4.1.2.4	Both CCK and secretin also have negative feedback effects on the stomach.
7.50.4.1.2.5	They slow the movements of the stomach, thus slowing the delivery of chyme into the small intestine and allowing more complete digestion in the duodenum.
7.50.4.1.3.1	The presence of food in the stomach stimulates cells in the lower region of the stomach to secrete a hormone called gastrin.
7.50.4.1.3.2	Gastrin returns to the stomach in the blood and stimulates the secretion of digestive juices and also increases the motility of the stomach.
7.50.4.1.3.3	Gastrin release begins to be inhibited when the pH of the stomach contents falls below 3&#8212;another example of negative feedback.
7.50.4.2.1.1	Most animals do not eat continuously, so they can be either in an absorptive state (food in the gut) or in a postabsorptive state (no food in the gut).
7.50.4.2.1.2	Nutrient requirements for energy metabolism and biosynthesis are continuous, however.
7.50.4.2.1.3	Thus nutrient traffic must be controlled so that reserves accumulate in the liver, muscle, and adipose (fat) tissue while the animal is in the absorptive state and are then used efficiently during the postabsorptive state.
7.50.4.2.1.4	When fuel molecules are abundant in the blood, the liver stores them in the form of glycogen and fats.
7.50.4.2.1.5	The liver also synthesizes blood plasma proteins from circulating amino acids.
7.50.4.2.1.6	When levels of fuel molecules in the blood decline, the liver taps its reserves and delivers nutrients into the blood.
7.50.4.2.2.1	The liver has an enormous capacity to interconvert fuel molecules.
7.50.4.2.2.2	Liver cells convert monosaccharides into either glycogen or fats during the absorptive state and then can reverse the process, returning glucose to the blood during the postabsorptive state.
7.50.4.2.2.3	The liver can also convert certain amino acids and some other molecules, such as pyruvate and lactate, into glucose&#8212;the process of gluconeogenesis (see Figure 9.14).
7.50.4.2.2.4	Gluconeogenesis provides an indirect pathway for exercising muscle to contribute to blood glucose levels.
7.50.4.2.2.5	At high levels of aerobic activity, muscle cells break down their stores of glycogen to provide glucose for metabolic fuel.
7.50.4.2.2.6	The glucose released from muscle glycogen, however, has to be used in the cells that produce it.
7.50.4.2.2.7	Glucose cannot leave muscle cells as it can leave liver cells.
7.50.4.2.2.8	However, when the activity of the muscle becomes anaerobic, pyruvate and lactate build up, leave muscle cells, and enter the circulation.
7.50.4.2.2.9	Circulating pyruvate and lactate are taken up by the liver and converted to glucose that can then move out of the liver cells, circulate in the blood, and be taken up by muscle cells.
7.50.4.3.1.1	The liver is the major controller of fat metabolism through its production of lipoproteins.
7.50.4.3.1.2	A lipoprotein is a particle made up of a core of hydrophobic fat and cholesterol with a covering of hydrophilic protein that allows it to be suspended in water.
7.50.4.3.1.3	Lipoproteins are the most abundant fuel reserve in the body, and they move fats from sites of absorption or synthesis to sites of storage, and from sites of storage to sites of use.
7.50.4.3.1.4	You saw in Key Concept 50.3 how bile in the intestine solves the problem of processing hydrophobic fats in an aqueous medium.
7.50.4.3.1.5	Transport of fats in the circulatory system presents the same problem, and lipoproteins provide the solution.
7.50.4.3.2.1	The chylomicrons produced by the mucosal cells of the intestine are the largest lipoprotein particles in the blood.
7.50.4.3.2.2	As the circulation carries chylomicrons through muscle, adipose tissue, and liver, lipoprotein lipases attached to the endothelial cells of capillaries break down the chylomicrons&#0039; triglycerides so that the component fatty acids, monoglycerides, and glycerol can be taken up by the cells.
7.50.4.3.2.3	The chylomicron remnants have lipid cores with a lot of cholesterol, and they are taken up by liver cells.
7.50.4.3.3.1	Lipoproteins different from chylomicrons are synthesized in the liver.
7.50.4.3.3.2	These lipoproteins can be classified according to their density.
7.50.4.3.3.3	Fat has a low density (it floats on water) and protein has a high density, so the greater the fat-to-protein ratio in the lipoprotein, the lower its density.
7.50.4.3.4.1	High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) transport lipids and cholesterol from tissues to the liver where the cholesterol can be used to synthesize bile.
7.50.4.3.4.2	HDL consists of about 50 percent protein, 35 percent lipids, and 15 percent cholesterol.
7.50.4.3.4.3	These are the &#8220;good&#8221; lipoproteins, and their levels are higher in people who exercise and are fit.
7.50.4.3.5.1	Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) transport cholesterol around the body for use in biosynthesis and for storage.
7.50.4.3.5.2	LDL consists of about 25 percent protein, 25 percent lipids, and 50 percent cholesterol.
7.50.4.3.5.3	These are the &#8220;bad&#8221; lipoproteins associated with a high risk for cardiovascular disease.
7.50.4.3.6.1	Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) contain mostly triglycerides, which are taken up by fat cells in adipose tissues around the body.
7.50.4.3.6.2	VLDL consists of about 2 percent protein, 94 percent lipids, and 3 percent cholesterol.
7.50.4.3.6.3	These are the &#8220;ugly&#8221; lipoproteins, as they are associated with obesity and diabetes as well as a high risk for cardiovascular disease.
7.50.4.4.1.1	During the absorptive state, blood glucose levels rise as carbohydrates are digested and absorbed (Focus: Key Figure 50.17).
7.50.4.4.1.2	During this time, the pancreas releases the hormone insulin which plays a major role in directing glucose to where it will be used or stored.
7.50.4.4.1.3	In Key Concept 50.3 we mentioned that the pancreas has both an exocrine function (secretions involved in digestion) and endocrine functions.
7.50.4.4.1.4	The endocrine functions are located in clusters of cells in the pancreas called the islets of Langerhans.
7.50.4.4.1.5	One class of islet cells, the beta cells, produces and releases insulin.
7.50.4.4.1.6	Another class, the alpha cells, produces and releases the hormone glucagon (discussed below).
7.50.4.4.1.7	The actions of insulin vary in different tissues, but they are all aimed at promoting the use of glucose for metabolic fuel and directing the excess glucose into storage as either glycogen or fat.
7.50.4.4.2.1	focus: key figure
7.50.4.4.3.1	Figure 50.17 Regulating Glucose Levels in the Blood
7.50.4.4.4.1	Q: The nervous system depends on a constant supply of glucose, yet none of the actions of insulin or glucagon in this figure refer to supplying glucose to the nervous system.
7.50.4.4.4.2	Why?
7.50.4.4.5.1	Glucose enters cells by diffusion.
7.50.4.4.5.2	This diffusion is facilitated by transporters, but they are not active transporters&#8212;they require a concentration gradient, which is why it is important to regulate blood glucose levels so there is always an adequate glucose concentration gradient across the cell membranes.
7.50.4.4.5.3	There are several kinds of glucose transporters, and those in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues are normally sequestered in cytoplasmic vesicles until insulin binds its receptors on the cell surface and triggers the insertion of transporters into the cell membrane.
7.50.4.4.6.1	Insulin plays many roles in controlling how cells use the glucose they take up from the circulation.
7.50.4.4.6.2	In adipose cells, insulin inhibits lipase and promotes fat synthesis from glucose.
7.50.4.4.6.3	In the liver, insulin activates an enzyme, glucokinase, that phosphorylates glucose as it enters the liver cell so it cannot diffuse back out again, thereby enhancing the overall diffusion of glucose into the cells.
7.50.4.4.6.4	At the same time, insulin inhibits the enzyme glucose phosphatase that enables glucose to leave the cell.
7.50.4.4.6.5	Insulin also activates glycogen synthase, an enzyme in liver cells that catalyzes the incorporation of glucose into glycogen, and activates enzymes that increase the flow of glucose into glycolysis (Figure 50.18).
7.50.4.4.6.6	Figure 50.18 Insulin Controls Glucose Traffic in the Liver
7.50.4.4.7.1	To maintain blood glucose levels during the postabsorptive state, liver cells break down their stored glycogen, releasing glucose into the blood.
7.50.4.4.7.2	The multiple processes that make it possible for the liver to release glucose depend on a fall in blood insulin levels (see Figure 50.18).
7.50.4.4.7.3	Falling insulin inhibits the enzyme responsible for glycogen synthesis and activates the enzyme that breaks down glycogen.
7.50.4.4.7.4	Also, with less insulin, the enzyme that phosphorylates glucose is inhibited and activity of glucose phosphatase is increased.
7.50.4.4.7.5	The result is a breakdown of glycogen and the return of glucose to the blood.
7.50.4.4.7.6	Another consequence of the fall in insulin levels is the increased activity of lipases in the liver and adipose tissue, releasing fatty acids to the blood.
7.50.4.4.7.7	Most cells preferentially use fatty acids as their metabolic fuel during the postabsorptive state.
7.50.4.4.7.8	Overall, the most important control of fuel metabolism in the postabsorptive state is the lack of insulin.
7.50.4.4.8.1	One tissue that does not switch fuel sources when an animal is postabsorptive is the nervous system.
7.50.4.4.8.2	The cells of the nervous system require a constant supply of glucose and can use other fuels only to a very limited extent.
7.50.4.4.8.3	Most neurons do not require insulin to absorb glucose from the blood, but they do need an adequate glucose concentration gradient to drive the facilitated diffusion of glucose across their cell membranes.
7.50.4.4.8.4	Therefore it is critical that blood glucose levels are maintained when an animal is postabsorptive.
7.50.4.4.8.5	The overall dependence of neural tissues on glucose, and their requirement for constant blood glucose levels, are the reasons it is so important for other cells of the body to shift to fat metabolism during the postabsorptive state.
7.50.4.4.9.1	The metabolism of fuel molecules during the postabsorptive state is mostly controlled by the lack of insulin, but if blood glucose falls below a certain level, glucagon is released.
7.50.4.4.9.2	Glucagon&#0039;s effect is opposite that of insulin: it stimulates liver cells to break down glycogen and to carry out gluconeogenesis.
7.50.4.4.9.3	Thus, under the influence of glucagon, the liver produces glucose and releases it into the blood.
7.50.4.4.9.4	Note that under conditions that stimulate glucagon release, the effects of low insulin are already in play&#8212;low glycogen synthase activity, low glucokinase activity, and high glucose phosphatase activity.
7.50.4.5.1.1	Multiple brain areas and signals are involved in the regulation of food intake.
7.50.4.5.1.2	Long ago it was discovered that damaging a region in the center of the rat hypothalamus resulted in the rats increasing their food intake and becoming obese.
7.50.4.5.1.3	Damage to the lateral hypothalamus, however, led to decreased food intake and the rats became thin.
7.50.4.5.1.4	In both cases the rats eventually reached a new equilibrium body weight; thus it appeared that a capacity for regulation remained, but the set point was altered.
7.50.4.5.2.1	We now know that another region of the hypothalamus, the arcuate nucleus, plays an important role in integrating a variety of feedback signals that influence food intake and body mass.
7.50.4.5.2.2	Cells within the arcuate nucleus send axons to the ventromedial and dorsal hypothalamus, as well as to other brain areas that influence food intake and metabolism.
7.50.4.5.2.3	One group of arcuate neurons projects to brain areas that inhibit food intake, while the other projects to brain areas that stimulate food intake.
7.50.4.5.2.4	But what stimulates or inhibits the activity of the arcuate neurons?
7.50.4.5.3.1	Several factors have been identified that reflect the body&#0039;s energy balance.
7.50.4.5.3.2	Three of these are the proteins insulin, leptin, and ghrelin.
7.50.4.5.3.3	Insulin, as detailed earlier, is released when blood glucose levels are high, and it induces a decline in food intake.
7.50.4.5.3.4	Leptin (Greek leptos, &#8220;thin&#8221;) is released by fat cells in proportion to how much lipid they contain.
7.50.4.5.3.5	Evidence that leptin is a satiety signal is described in Figure 50.19.
7.50.4.5.3.6	Ghrelin is released by the stomach when it is empty; its levels rise before meals and fall after meals.
7.50.4.5.3.7	In the arcuate nucleus, insulin and leptin activate the neurons that inhibit feeding and inhibit the neurons that stimulate feeding.

7.50.4.5.8.1	In mice the Ob gene codes for the protein leptin, a satiety factor that signals the brain when enough food has been consumed.
7.50.4.5.8.2	The recessive ob allele is a loss-of-function allele, so ob/ob mice do not produce leptin; they do not experience satiety and become obese.
7.50.4.5.8.3	The Db gene encodes the leptin receptor, so mice homozygous for the recessive loss-of-function allele db, even if they produce leptin, cannot use it and so become obese.
7.50.4.5.9.1	HYPOTHESIS Mice that cannot produce the satiety signal protein leptin will not become obese if they are able to obtain leptin from an outside source.
7.50.4.5.10.1	METHOD
7.50.4.5.11.1	Create two strains of genetically obese laboratory mice, one that lacks functional leptin (genotype ob/ob) and one that lacks the receptor for leptin (genotype db/db).
7.50.4.5.12.1	Create parabiotic pairs by surgically joining the circulatory systems of a non-obese (wild-type) mouse with a partner from one of the obese strains.
7.50.4.5.13.1	Allow mice to feed at will.
7.50.4.5.14.1	RESULTS
7.50.4.5.15.1	Parabiotic ob/ob mice obtain leptin from the wild-type (WT) partner and lose fat.
7.50.4.5.15.2	Parabiotic db/db mice remain obese because they lack the leptin receptor and thus the leptin they obtain from their partner has no effect.
7.50.4.5.16.1	CONCLUSION The protein leptin is a satiety signal that acts to prevent overeating and resultant obesity.
7.50.4.5.17.1	An integrative signal that could be playing a central role in regulation of feeding is the enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).
7.50.4.5.17.2	When most cells are nutrient deprived, they produce AMPK, which stimulates the oxidation of substrates to replenish ATP.
7.50.4.5.17.3	Fasting increases AMPK levels in the hypothalamus, and feeding reduces them.
7.50.4.5.17.4	Insulin and leptin decrease AMPK activity in the hypothalamus, and ghrelin increases it.
7.50.4.5.17.5	Thus AMPK could be a common pathway for various signals controlling food intake.
7.50.4.5.18.1	50.4 recap
7.50.4.5.19.1	The major factors controlling gut function are autonomic reflexes, the enteric nervous system, and the hormones gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin.
7.50.4.5.19.2	Insulin is the major hormonal controller of fuel metabolism through its effects on liver, muscle, and adipose tissues.
7.50.4.5.19.3	The hypothalamus controls food intake by generating sensations of hunger and satiety influenced by feedback from blood glucose and hormones, including insulin, leptin, and ghrelin.

7.50.4.5.28.1	For various reasons patients may be fed through a tube going into their stomachs or tubes going all the way to their jejunum, the middle region of their small intestines.
7.50.4.5.28.2	How would the feeding formulas used in the jejunal tube have to differ from the one applied through the gastric tube?
7.50.4.5.29.1	How do the three classes of lipoproteins differ in structure and function?
7.50.4.5.30.1	How are the effects of high and low insulin levels the same and different in liver and muscle?
7.50.4.5.31.1	In the experiments in which the lateral or the ventromedial hypothalamus was lesioned, what result enabled the conclusion that the regulation of body mass was altered rather than just the ability to produce satiety or hunger by the nutritional state of the body?
7.50.4.5.32.1	When exercising muscles do not have an adequate supply of oxygen, they continue to produce small amounts of ATP through glycolysis, but they also produce pyruvate and lactate.
7.50.4.5.32.2	Explain how this pyruvate and lactate can help support continuing glycolysis.
7.50.4.5.33.1	What evidence supports the hypothesis that leptin influences satiety?

7.50.4.5.35.1	If the nutritional values were the same, could different foods have different impacts on health?
7.50.4.5.36.1	The Pima of Arizona were among the first communities to be examined with a genome-wide survey.
7.50.4.5.36.2	Many candidate genes were shown to be associated with obesity, but weakly so.
7.50.4.5.36.3	The conclusion was that there are genetic contributions to the propensity to develop obesity, but except for a few rare cases, obesity is a multigenic trait that is highly influenced by environment.
7.50.4.5.36.4	One aspect of the environment is physical activity, but another one is diet.
7.50.4.5.36.5	The caloric content of the diet is obviously an important factor, but what about the composition of the diet?
7.50.4.5.36.6	The experiments described in Investigating Life: How Does the Gut Microbiome Contribute to Obesity and Metabolic Disease? show that the composition of the diet can influence the composition of the gut microbiome, and the gut microbiome can influence the nutritional and other health effects of the diet.
7.50.4.5.36.7	Thus, apart from differences in caloric intake, the consequences of the Pima switching from a traditional diet to a high-fat Western diet could have resulted in changes in their microbiomes that have contributed to obesity and diabetes.
7.50.4.5.37.1	Future directions
7.50.4.5.38.1	It would be of interest to compare the microbiomes of the Arizona and the Mexican Pima peoples, and to compare those with the microbiomes of other populations on similar and different diets.
7.50.4.5.38.2	If a particular microbiome profile is associated with the obesity&#8211;diabetes phenotype, it might be possible to change that microbiome through dietary change to promote better health.
7.50.4.5.38.3	Just as we now do genomic screening to identify health risks, we might consider microbiome screening.
7.50.4.5.38.4	Whereas we cannot change our genetic makeup, we could change our microbiome either through diet, or even therapeutically by uses of antibiotics and microbiome transplants.
7.50.4.5.38.5	A new branch of medicine could develop around the testing, diagnosis, and therapy of the gut microbiome.

7.50.1.1	In Pima populations, historic occurrences of food deprivation may have imposed selection for genes that improve the efficiency of managing the energy obtained from food.
7.50.1.2	With modern diets and lifestyles, these &#8220;thrifty genes&#8221; can contribute to obesity and diabetes.

7.50.8.1	Thrifty Phenotypes
7.50.9.1	For thousands of years the Pima of southwestern North America were hunters and gatherers, supplementing their diet with subsistence agriculture.
7.50.9.2	Their environment was arid, so they developed sophisticated irrigation systems; even so, they frequently encountered drought and subsequent starvation.
7.50.9.3	Today most individuals of the ethnic Pima population in North America are clinically obese.
7.50.9.4	As a population they are one of the heaviest in the world.
7.50.10.1	Obesity contributes to health problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.
7.50.10.2	Diabetes incidence in the Pima is seven times the national average.
7.50.10.3	Two-thirds of Pima adults over the age of 40 are diabetic, and diabetes is occurring in younger individuals than previously seen.
7.50.10.4	What has caused such a radical health change in the population?
7.50.10.5	Two interacting factors are involved: genetics and lifestyle.
7.50.11.1	Geneticists hypothesize that recurring episodes of starvation produce strong selective pressure for &#8220;thrifty genes&#8221;&#8212;particular alleles of the genes involved in digestion, absorption, and energy storage that result in greater-than-average efficiency in converting food into fat.
7.50.11.2	Thrifty genes would carry a strong selective advantage when food is scarce.
7.50.11.3	The Pima display a &#8220;thrifty&#8221; phenotype.
7.50.11.4	They have low resting metabolic rates and convert food into fat readily.
7.50.11.5	Insulin facilitates conversion of dietary sugar into fat.
7.50.11.6	For many Pima, consuming a standard amount of glucose causes their insulin levels to rise three times higher than it does in people of European ancestry.
7.50.12.1	Modern lifestyle also plays a role in the Pima obesity epidemic.
7.50.12.2	Instead of eating their traditional diet, the Pima now eat a high-calorie, high-fat Western diet, and they engage in less physical activity than their ancestors did.
7.50.12.3	A population of Pima living in the Sierra Madre of northern Mexico are genetically the same as the Arizona population.
7.50.12.4	However, they eat traditional foods and live a traditional lifestyle that involves much physical activity.
7.50.12.5	Obesity and diabetes are not prevalent among the Mexico Pima.
7.50.13.1	A high-calorie diet and sedentary lifestyle affect not just the Pima but contribute to the overall increase in obesity throughout the U.S. population.
7.50.13.2	Recently an additional factor that might contribute to obesity and diabetes has been discovered&#8212;the type of food that is eaten.
7.50.13.3	The composition of the diet influences the populations of gut microbes, and those microbes influence outcomes of digestion.
7.50.13.4	Apparently calories are not all equal; their impact depends on their origin.
7.50.14.1	If the nutritional values were the same, could different foods have different impacts on health?
7.50.15.1	Chapter 50 continues with
7.50.16.1	50.1 Food Provides Energy As Well As Materials for Biosynthesis
7.51.1.1.1	Osmosis causes water to enter or to leave cells
7.51.1.2.1	Excretory systems control extracellular fluid osmolarity and composition
7.51.1.3.1	Aquatic invertebrates are either ionic conformers or regulators
7.51.1.4.1	Vertebrates are osmoregulators and ionic regulators
7.51.1.5.1	Homeostasis of the extracellular fluid (the blood plasma and interstitial fluid; see Key Concept 39.2) is critical for several reasons:
7.51.1.6.1	The solute concentration of the extracellular fluid determines the water balance of the cells of the body.
7.51.1.7.1	The specific ionic composition of the extracellular fluid influences many cell functions.
7.51.1.8.1	The health of cells requires the elimination of nitrogenous wastes.
7.51.1.9.1	The problems that have to be solved to maintain homeostasis of the extracellular fluid depend on the environment in which a species lives (salt water, fresh water, or terrestrial) and its lifestyle, as you saw in the case of the vampire bat in the opening story.
7.51.1.9.2	Animals depend on excretory systems to maintain the volume, concentration, and composition of their extracellular fluids, and to excrete wastes.
7.51.1.10.1	focus your learning
7.51.1.11.1	Animal excretory systems use filtration, secretion, and reabsorption to regulate osmolarity and ionic composition of the extracellular fluid.
7.51.1.12.1	Aquatic animals either conform to the osmolarity of the environment or expend energy to maintain a constant internal osmolarity.
7.51.1.1.1.1	The volume of a cell depends on whether it takes up water from or loses water to the extracellular fluid.
7.51.1.1.1.2	The movement of water across cell membranes via osmosis depends on differences in solute concentration on the two sides of the membrane and on the permeability of the membrane (see Key Concept 6.3).
7.51.1.1.1.3	If the solute concentration of the extracellular fluid is less than that of the cytoplasm, water moves into the cells, causing them to swell and possibly burst (see Figure 6.10).
7.51.1.1.1.4	If the solute concentration of the extracellular fluid is greater than that of the cytoplasm, the cells lose water and shrink.
7.51.1.1.1.5	Thus the solute concentration of the extracellular fluid affects both the volume and the solute concentration of the cells.
7.51.1.1.2.1	Animal physiologists use the term osmolarity in discussing osmosis.
7.51.1.1.2.2	The osmolarity of a solution is the number of *moles of osmotically active solutes per liter of solvent.
7.51.1.1.2.3	Thus a 1-molar solution of glucose is also a 1-osmolar (1 osmole per liter) solution, but a 1-molar solution of sodium chloride (NaCl) is a 2-osmolar solution, because each NaCl molecule dissociates into two osmotically active ions.
7.51.1.1.3.1	*connect the concepts As described in Key Concept 2.4, a mole is the amount of a substance in grams that is numerically equal to its molecular weight.
7.51.1.2.1.1	Excretory systems control the osmolarity and composition of the extracellular fluids by excreting solutes that are present in excess (such as NaCl when we eat lots of salty food) and conserving solutes that are valuable or in short supply (such as glucose and amino acids).
7.51.1.2.1.2	Excretory systems also eliminate the toxic waste products of protein metabolism.
7.51.1.2.1.3	The output of the excretory system is urine.
7.51.1.2.2.1	Three basic processes are common to a wide variety of animal excretory systems: filtration, secretion, and reabsorption.
7.51.1.2.2.2	Filtered extracellular fluid contains no cells or large molecules, such as proteins.
7.51.1.2.2.3	In animals with a closed circulatory system, the blood plasma is filtered from capillaries into associated tubules.
7.51.1.2.2.4	The walls of the capillaries and of the tubules are the filter, and the filtration is driven by blood pressure.
7.51.1.2.2.5	As the filtrate flows through the tubules, its composition and concentration are modified through processes of secretion and reabsorption to form the urine that leaves the body.
7.51.1.2.3.1	In all of the discussions that follow about the movement of water across membranes, it is important to remember that there are no mechanisms for the active transport of water.
7.51.1.2.3.2	The movement of water is due either to a pressure difference (filtration) or to a difference in solute concentration (osmosis).
7.51.1.2.3.3	Water molecules move down a pressure gradient or up a solute concentration gradient.
7.51.1.3.1.1	Most invertebrates that live in seawater conform to the osmotic concentration of their environment over a fairly wide range of salinities and are therefore called osmoconformers (Figure 51.1).
7.51.1.3.1.2	The osmolarity of seawater in the open ocean is about 1,000 milliosmoles/liter (mosm/L), but it can vary quite a bit in estuaries where it is diluted by an influx of fresh water or in evaporating tide pools as the salt gets concentrated.
7.51.1.3.1.3	Osmoconformity can result in considerable energetic savings, as it costs metabolic energy to move ions across membranes to achieve osmotic regulation.
7.51.1.3.1.4	Figure 51.1 Some Marine Invertebrates Osmoregulate
7.51.1.3.2.1	Osmoconformity is not an option for freshwater animals.
7.51.1.3.2.2	No cell can do without ions or nutrients, so freshwater animals always have to expend energy to conserve salts and excrete water.
7.51.1.3.3.1	Some marine invertebrates maintain a rather constant osmolarity of their extracellular fluids as the osmolarity of the environment changes, and these animals are therefore called osmoregulators (see Figure 51.1).
7.51.1.3.3.2	Osmoregulators in the marine environment mostly maintain their osmotic concentration considerably below that of the environment and are therefore engaged in hypotonic regulation.
7.51.1.3.3.3	Occasionally, however, seawater is diluted by an influx of fresh water, as in estuaries, and animals must maintain their osmotic concentrations above that of the environment   a process called hypertonic regulation.
7.51.1.3.4.1	The brine shrimp Artemia illustrated in Figure 51.1 is an osmoregulator with an enormous range of tolerances.
7.51.1.3.4.2	Artemia are found in huge numbers in extremely salty environments, such as Utah&#8217;s Great Salt Lake and in coastal evaporation ponds where salt is concentrated for commercial purposes (see Figure 25.17) and can reach an osmolarity of 2,500 mosm/L. No animal could survive with internal osmolarities that high; such a solute concentration would cause proteins to denature.
7.51.1.3.4.3	Artemia are able to exploit these environments because of their ability to regulate hypotonically by actively transporting NaCl from their extracellular fluid out across their gill membranes to the environment.
7.51.1.3.4.4	Artemia cannot survive in fresh water, but they can live in dilute seawater by reversing the direction of transport of NaCl across their gill membranes to maintain the osmolarity of their extracellular fluids above that of the environment, thus becoming hypertonic regulators.
7.51.1.3.5.1	Invertebrates that are osmoconformers still have to be ionic regulators with respect to certain ions.
7.51.1.3.5.2	Although the concentrations of Na&#43; and Cl    in their extracellular fluids may be the same as in seawater, many other ions are regulated at different levels.
7.51.1.3.5.3	For example, the concentration of K&#43; is usually higher, and the concentrations of Mg2+ and of SO42+ are usually lower, in the extracellular fluids than in the seawater.
7.51.1.3.5.4	Active transporters maintain the regulated ions in the extracellular fluid at optimal concentrations.
7.51.1.4.1.1	All aquatic vertebrates, with two exceptions, regulate the osmolarity of their extracellular fluids at around 300 mosm/L. In doing so, they are selective in which ions they conserve and which ions they excrete; thus they are ionic regulators and osmoregulators.
7.51.1.4.1.2	One exception is the hagfish, a primitive jawless fish and a very ancient vertebrate group (see Figure 32.11).
7.51.1.4.1.3	Hagfishes are osmoconformers as well as ionic conformers for most of the ions found in seawater.
7.51.1.4.1.4	The other exception is members of the class Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes, the sharks and rays).
7.51.1.4.1.5	The cartilaginous fishes retain in their extracellular fluid two organic solutes, urea and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), that are products of protein metabolism.
7.51.1.4.1.6	As a result, their extracellular fluid is slightly hypertonic to the seawater and they gain water by osmosis.
7.51.1.4.2.1	Terrestrial vertebrates obtain their salts mostly from food, and they regulate the ionic composition of their extracellular fluids by conserving some ions and excreting others.
7.51.1.4.2.2	For example, herbivores have to conserve Na&#43; because most plants have low concentrations of Na&#43;.
7.51.1.4.2.3	In contrast, birds that feed on marine animals must excrete the excess sodium they ingest with their food.
7.51.1.4.2.4	Such birds, which include penguins and gulls, excrete excess salt through nasal salt glands.
7.51.1.4.2.5	These glands use secondary active transport of Cl    ions (with Na&#43; and some water following passively) into a series of canals and ducts to produce a concentrated solution of NaCl that empties into the nasal cavity (Figure 51.2).
7.51.1.4.2.6	These birds can be seen frequently sneezing or shaking their heads to get rid of the salty droplets excreted from their nasal salt glands.
7.51.1.4.3.1	Figure 51.2 Nasal Salt Glands Excrete Excess Salt
7.51.1.4.4.1	51.1 recap
7.51.1.4.5.1	Excretory systems control water and salt balance and the excretion of nitrogenous waste products through three mechanisms: filtration of body fluids to form urine, active secretion of substances into the urine, and active reabsorption of substances from the urine.
7.51.1.4.6.1	learning outcomes
7.51.1.4.7.1	You should be able to:
7.51.1.4.8.1	Describe the roles of filtration, secretion, and reabsorption in the excretory systems of animals with closed circulatory systems.
7.51.1.4.9.1	Given data about the extracellular composition and environment of a particular species, determine its osmoregulatory characteristics.
7.51.1.4.10.1	What is the significance of a closed circulatory system for osmoregulation in a freshwater vertebrate?
7.51.1.4.11.1	Why is it important for an animal like Artemia that lives in the intertidal zone to be able to osmoregulate, and how does Artemia do that at the extremes of salinities in its environment?
7.51.1.4.12.1	How does water get into the nasal salt gland ducts of marine birds?
7.51.1.4.13.1	In addition to maintaining salt and water balance, animals must eliminate the waste products of metabolism from their extracellular fluids.
7.51.1.4.13.2	The major problem is nitrogen.
7.51.1.4.13.3	When nitrogen-containing molecules are broken down by metabolism, the end product can be toxic.
7.51.1.4.14.1	Chapter 51 continues with
7.51.1.4.15.1	51.2 Animals Excrete Nitrogen as Ammonia, Urea, or Uric Acid
7.51.2.1.1	Ammonia is toxic
7.51.2.2.1	Urea is highly soluble in water
7.51.2.3.1	Uric acid is not very soluble in water
7.51.2.4.1	Most species produce more than one nitrogenous waste
7.51.2.5.1	The end products of the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats are water and carbon dioxide, which are not difficult to eliminate.
7.51.2.5.2	Proteins and nucleic acids, however, contain nitrogen, so their metabolism produces nitrogenous wastes in addition to water and carbon dioxide.
7.51.2.6.1	focus your learning
7.51.2.7.1	Nitrogenous waste products have different advantages in different environments.
7.51.2.8.1	Excreting uric acid conserves water.
7.51.2.1.1.1	The most common nitrogenous waste is ammonia (NH3).
7.51.2.1.1.2	Because it is highly toxic, ammonia is either excreted continuously to prevent its accumulation or is detoxified by conversion into urea or uric acid (Figure 51.3).
7.51.2.1.1.3	Ammonia is highly soluble in water and diffuses rapidly, so its continuous excretion is relatively simple for many aquatic animals that continuously lose ammonia from their blood to the environment by diffusion across their gill membranes.
7.51.2.1.1.4	Animals that excrete ammonia, such as aquatic invertebrates and bony fishes, are called ammonotelic.
7.51.2.1.1.5	Figure 51.3 Nitrogenous Waste Products of Metabolism
7.51.2.1.2.1	Ammonia can also be lost by diffusion across the alveolar membranes of air-breathing animals, but with tidal ventilation, the buildup of ammonia in the extracellular fluids would be greater and therefore toxic.
7.51.2.1.2.2	Therefore these animals detoxify ammonia by converting it into urea or uric acid.
7.51.2.2.1.1	Mammals, amphibians, cartilaginous fishes (sharks and rays), and hagfishes excrete urea as their principal nitrogenous waste product and are therefore called ureotelic.
7.51.2.2.1.2	Urea is quite soluble in water, but its excretion can result in a large loss of water that many animals can ill afford.
7.51.2.2.1.3	Mammals have somewhat solved this problem through the evolution of excretory systems that can produce urine with a high concentration of urea, thereby decreasing the water loss associated with excretion of urea.
7.51.2.2.1.4	Also, recall from Key Concept 51.1 that sharks and rays solve the water loss problem of living in sea water by retaining high concentrations of urea and TMAO in their extracellular fluid, so that it is hyperosmotic to seawater.
7.51.2.3.1.1	A single molecule of uric acid eliminates twice the amount of nitrogen as does a molecule of urea (see Figure 51.3), but uric acid is not very soluble in water.
7.51.2.3.1.2	Therefore it tends to precipitate out of solution and form a colloidal suspension in the urine and is excreted as a semisolid (for example, the whitish material in bird droppings).
7.51.2.3.1.3	Because of the precipitation of the uric acid out of solution in the excretory system, water can be reabsorbed from the urine and thereby reduce the water loss necessary to excrete the nitrogenious waste.
7.51.2.3.1.4	Animals that excrete uric acid are uricotelic, and they include insects, reptiles (including birds), and some amphibians.
7.51.2.3.1.5	Many uricotelic species live in very arid environments.
7.51.2.4.1.1	Humans are ureotelic, but we also excrete uric acid.
7.51.2.4.1.2	The uric acid in human urine comes largely from the metabolism of nucleic acids.
7.51.2.4.1.3	If uric acid levels in the extracellular fluid rise too high, uric acid can precipitate in joints, causing the age-old malady gout.
7.51.2.4.1.4	Because solubility goes down with temperature, uric acid usually precipitates first in the extremities, especially the big toe.
7.51.2.4.1.5	Pain in the big toe is a telltale symptom of gout.
7.51.2.4.1.6	The risk for developing gout goes up with excessive consumption of protein, beer, and spirits (less so with wine) and in general with obesity and insulin resistance.
7.51.2.4.1.7	Therefore in the past it was called &#8220;the disease of rich men. &#8221; Gout has been around for a very long time; the first documented case was in Egypt around 2500 B.C.E.
7.51.2.4.2.1	Humans can also excrete ammonia, which is an important mechanism for regulating the pH of the extracellular fluids.
7.51.2.4.2.2	As you will see later in this chapter, excreted ammonia buffers the urine and enables the excretion of excess hydrogen ions.
7.51.2.4.3.1	Species that live in different habitats at different developmental stages may use more than one mechanism of nitrogen excretion.
7.51.2.4.3.2	The tadpoles of frogs and toads, for example, excrete ammonia across their gill membranes, but adult frogs and toads generally excrete urea.
7.51.2.4.3.3	Some adult amphibians that live in arid habitats excrete uric acid.
7.51.2.4.4.1	51.2 recap
7.51.2.4.5.1	Ammonia is a common metabolic waste product of nitrogen-containing molecules.
7.51.2.4.5.2	Most aquatic animals excrete ammonia by diffusion into the water.
7.51.2.4.5.3	Terrestrial animals and some aquatic animals detoxify ammonia by converting it to urea or uric acid.
7.51.2.4.6.1	learning outcomes
7.51.2.4.7.1	You should be able to:
7.51.2.4.8.1	Compare the properties of ammonia, urea, and uric acid as nitrogenous waste products.
7.51.2.4.9.1	Describe the relative advantages and disadvantages of excreting nitrogenous waste as urea or as uric acid.
7.51.2.4.10.1	When amino acids are broken down, a first step is removal of the amine group, forming ammonia.
7.51.2.4.10.2	What happens to that ammonia in a fish and in a mammal?
7.51.2.4.10.3	Explain why this happens.
7.51.2.4.11.1	Why do sharks and rays produce urea rather than uric acid to raise the osmotic concentration of their extracellular fluids?
7.51.2.4.12.1	For terrestrial animals, what is the advantage of excreting uric acid as the nitrogenous waste product?
7.51.2.4.13.1	Animals exhibit a variety of adaptations for dealing with the challenges of salt and water balance in different environments.
7.51.2.4.13.2	All of these adaptations, however, are based on two basic mechanisms   namely, filtration and tubular processing of the filtrate to conserve some solutes and excrete others.
7.51.2.4.14.1	Chapter 51 continues with
7.51.2.4.15.1	51.3 Invertebrate Excretory Systems Use Filtration, Secretion, and Reabsorption
7.51.3.1.1	Protonephridia of flatworms excrete water and conserve salts
7.51.3.2.1	Metanephridia of annelids process coelomic fluid
7.51.3.3.1	Malpighian tubules of insects use active transport to excrete wastes
7.51.3.4.1	Freshwater and terrestrial invertebrates have a wide variety of adaptations for maintaining salt and water balance and excreting nitrogen.
7.51.3.4.2	Here we explore three examples of invertebrate excretory systems: protonephridia, metanephridia, and Malpighian tubules.
7.51.3.4.3	Each of these systems produces an extract of interstitial fluid lacking large molecules.
7.51.3.4.4	They then change the solute composition (ions and small molecules) of that fluid to form an excretory product.
7.51.3.5.1	focus your learning
7.51.3.6.1	Protonephridia of flatworms process filtered extracellular fluid by secretion and reabsorption of solutes.
7.51.3.7.1	Metanephridia of annelids filter blood from their closed circulatory systems and process the resulting filtrate by secretion and reabsorption in a system of tubules.
7.51.3.8.1	Malpighian tubules use active transport of solutes, including uric acid, to pull extracellular fluid into the tubules osmotically; precipitation of the uric acid enables reabsorption of water.
7.51.3.1.1.1	Many free-living flatworms, such as Planaria, live in fresh water.
7.51.3.1.1.2	These animals excrete water through an elaborate network of tubules running throughout their bodies.
7.51.3.1.1.3	The tubules end in flame cells, so called because each cell has a tuft of cilia projecting into the tubule (Figure 51.4).
7.51.3.1.1.4	The beating of the cilia gives the appearance of a flickering flame.
7.51.3.1.1.5	A flame cell and a tubule together form a protonephridium (plural protonephridia; Greek proto, &#8220;before,&#8221; + nephros, &#8220;kidney&#8221;).
7.51.3.1.1.6	Figure 51.4 Protonephridia in Flatworms
7.51.3.1.2.1	Extracellular fluid enters the tubules by filtration.
7.51.3.1.2.2	The beating of the cilia causes a slight negative pressure in the tubule, and movements of the animal create positive pressure in the extracellular fluid.
7.51.3.1.2.3	This pressure difference causes extracellular fluid to be filtered through tiny spaces between tubule cells.
7.51.3.1.2.4	The filtrate flows toward the animal&#8217;s excretory pore, and along the way the cells of the tubules modify the composition of the fluid by reabsorption and secretion of specific ions and molecules.
7.51.3.1.2.5	Because more ions are reabsorbed than are secreted, the urine that leaves the flatworm&#8217;s body is less concentrated than the extracellular fluid.
7.51.3.1.2.6	Thus the protonephridium conserves ions and excretes water and wastes.
7.51.3.2.1.1	Filtration of body fluids and modification of urine by tubules are highly developed processes in annelids such as the earthworm.
7.51.3.2.1.2	Annelids are segmented, and in each segment they have a fluid-filled body cavity called a coelom (see Figure 31.11).
7.51.3.2.1.3	Annelids have a closed circulatory system through which blood is pumped under pressure.
7.51.3.2.1.4	The pressure causes the blood to be filtered across the thin, permeable capillary walls into the coelom.
7.51.3.2.1.5	Some waste products, such as ammonia, diffuse directly from the tissues into the coelom.
7.51.3.2.1.6	Where does this coelomic fluid go?
7.51.3.2.2.1	Each segment of the earthworm contains a pair of metanephridia (singular metanephridium; Greek meta, &#8220;akin to&#8221;).
7.51.3.2.2.2	Each metanephridium begins as a ciliated, funnel-like opening called a nephrostome.
7.51.3.2.2.3	The nephrostome resides in one segment and continues as a tubule in the next segment.
7.51.3.2.2.4	The tubule ends in a pore, called a nephridiopore, that opens to the outside of the animal (Figure 51.5).
7.51.3.2.2.5	Coelomic fluid is swept into the metanephridia through the ciliated nephrostomes.
7.51.3.2.2.6	As the fluid passes through the tubules, their cells actively reabsorb certain molecules from it and actively secrete other molecules into it.
7.51.3.2.2.7	What leaves the animal through the nephridiopores is a dilute urine containing nitrogenous wastes and other solutes.
7.51.3.2.3.1	Figure 51.5 Metanephridia in Earthworms
7.51.3.3.1.1	Insects can excrete nitrogenous wastes with very little loss of water and can therefore live in the driest habitats on Earth.
7.51.3.3.1.2	The insect excretory system consists of Malpighian tubules.
7.51.3.3.1.3	An individual insect has from 2 to more than 100 of these blind-ended tubules that open into the gut between the midgut and hindgut (Figure 51.6).
7.51.3.3.2.1	Figure 51.6 Malpighian Tubules in Insects
7.51.3.3.3.1	Insects have an open circulatory system and therefore cannot use a pressure difference to filter extracellular fluids into the Malpighian tubules.
7.51.3.3.3.2	Instead, the cells of the tubules actively transport uric acid, potassium ions, and sodium ions from the extracellular fluid into the tubules.
7.51.3.3.3.3	The high concentration of solutes in the tubules causes water to follow osmotically, which flushes the tubule contents toward the gut.
7.51.3.3.4.1	The epithelial cells of the hindgut and rectum actively transport sodium and potassium ions from the gut contents back into the extracellular fluid.
7.51.3.3.4.2	This local transport of salts creates an osmotic gradient that pulls water out of the rectal contents.
7.51.3.3.4.3	As its concentration increases, the uric acid forms a colloidal suspension, freeing even more water to be reabsorbed.
7.51.3.3.4.4	Remaining in the rectum is the uric acid mixed with other wastes; this semisolid matter is what the insect excretes.
7.51.3.3.4.5	If you ever park your car under a tree being visited by bees, you will find the little excretory droplets from the bees all over the car.
7.51.3.3.4.6	The Malpighian tubule system is a highly effective mechanism for excreting nitrogenous wastes and some salts without giving up much water.
7.51.3.3.5.1	51.3 recap
7.51.3.3.6.1	Protonephridia and metanephridia work by creating a filtrate of the body fluids that is modified by the secretion and reabsorption of specific substances before being excreted.
7.51.3.3.6.2	Insect Malpighian tubules actively secrete uric acid and other solutes into closed tubules.
7.51.3.3.7.1	learning outcomes
7.51.3.3.8.1	You should be able to:
7.51.3.3.9.1	Describe the structure and function of a protonephridium.

7.51.3.3.11.1	Explain how Malpighian tubules enable insects to live in very arid habitats.

7.51.3.3.13.1	What are the relationships among blood plasma, coelomic fluid, and urine in an annelid worm?
7.51.3.3.14.1	How does the insect excretory system conserve water?
7.51.3.3.15.1	Having described how several invertebrate groups handle nitrogen excretion, we will next consider the nephron   the basic unit of the vertebrate excretory system   and how it evolved to be able to respond to a variety of salt- and water-balance challenges and maintain a relatively constant internal environment.
7.51.3.3.16.1	Chapter 51 continues with
7.51.3.3.17.1	51.4 The Nephron Is the Basic Functional Unit of Vertebrate Excretory Systems
7.51.4.1.1	Marine fishes must conserve water

7.51.4.3.1	Mammals can produce highly concentrated urine
7.51.4.4.1	The nephron is the function unit of the vertebrate kidney
7.51.4.5.1	Blood is filtered into Bowman   s capsule
7.51.4.6.1	The renal tubules convert glomerular filtrate to urine
7.51.4.7.1	The main excretory organ of vertebrates is the kidney, and the functional unit of the kidney is the nephron, which has a blood vessel component and a tubule component.
7.51.4.7.2	The vascular component begins with a knot of capillaries that are highly permeable and filter the blood into the tubule component.
7.51.4.7.3	Processes of secretion and reabsorption in the tubules produce urine, which differs in composition from the extracellular fluids of the body.
7.51.4.8.1	focus your learning
7.51.4.9.1	Reptiles can be more independent of water sources than amphibians can.
7.51.4.10.1	The nephron produces urine through filtration of blood plasma in the glomerulus and tubular processing of the filtrate by reabsorption and secretion of solutes.
7.51.4.11.1	Glomerular filtration involves anatomical features of glomerular capillaries and cells of Bowman&#8217;s capsule.
7.51.4.12.1	The liquid that enters Bowman&#8217;s capsule is called the renal filtrate and is further processed into urine as it moves through the renal tubules of the nephron.
7.51.4.13.1	The evolution of vertebrates is thought to have begun with a marine ancestor that moved into a freshwater habitat.
7.51.4.13.2	The excretory system of this vertebrate ancestor would have evolved to excrete large quantities of water while conserving salts.
7.51.4.13.3	But if the early vertebrate excretory system evolved in response to the need to excrete water, how did subsequent vertebrate lineages adapt to environments where water must be conserved and salts excreted?
7.51.4.13.4	The answer to this question differs among vertebrate groups.
7.51.4.13.5	Even among marine fishes, the excretory adaptations of the bony fishes differ from those of the cartilaginous fishes.
7.51.4.13.6	Reptiles, including birds, and mammals have excretory systems that conserve water.
7.51.4.13.7	The reptiles achieve this mainly by being uricotelic and producing a semisolid excretory product that contains little water.
7.51.4.13.8	Mammals, in contrast, are ureotelic; they excrete a liquid waste product but have evolved the ability to produce highly concentrated urine.
7.51.4.1.1.1	Marine bony fishes osmoregulate their extracellular fluids to maintain them at one-third to one-half the osmolarity of seawater.
7.51.4.1.1.2	Thus marine bony fishes must conserve water, which they are constantly losing through osmosis, and must excrete excess solutes.
7.51.4.1.1.3	Marine bony fishes cannot produce urine that is more concentrated than their extracellular fluids, so they minimize water loss by producing very little urine.
7.51.4.1.1.4	In contrast, freshwater fishes produce lots of dilute urine.
7.51.4.1.2.1	How do marine bony fishes deal with the large salt loads they ingest with food?
7.51.4.1.2.2	Marine bony fishes do not absorb from their gut some of the ions they take in, especially divalent ions such as Mg2+ and SO42   .
7.51.4.1.2.3	NaCl, the major salt ingested, is actively excreted across the gill membranes.
7.51.4.1.2.4	As mentioned earlier, bony fishes can lose their nitrogenous waste, ammonia, by diffusion across their gill membranes.
7.51.4.1.3.1	Sharks and rays are osmoconformers but not ionic conformers.
7.51.4.1.3.2	As mentioned earlier, they raise the osmolarity of their body fluids by retaining urea and TMAO making their extracellular fluids hyperosmotic to seawater.
7.51.4.1.3.3	These species have adapted to a concentration of urea in the body fluids that would be toxic to other vertebrates.
7.51.4.1.3.4	Sharks and rays still have the problem of excreting the large amount of salts they take in with their food.
7.51.4.1.3.5	They solve this problem by having a gland in the rectum that actively secretes NaCl by a mechanism similar to that of the nasal salt glands of seabirds.
7.51.4.2.1.1	Most amphibians live in or near fresh water, and they usually stay in humid habitats when they do venture from the water.
7.51.4.2.1.2	Like freshwater fishes, most amphibians produce large amounts of dilute urine and conserve salts.
7.51.4.2.1.3	Some amphibians, however, have adapted to habitats that require water conservation.
7.51.4.2.2.1	Amphibians living in dry terrestrial environments have skin with a reduced permeability to water.
7.51.4.2.2.2	Some secrete a waxy substance over the skin for waterproofing.
7.51.4.2.2.3	Several species of frogs that live in arid regions of Australia burrow into the ground and remain there during long dry periods.
7.51.4.2.2.4	They enter estivation, a state of very low metabolic activity and therefore low water turnover.
7.51.4.2.2.5	When it rains, the frogs come out of estivation, feed, and reproduce.
7.51.4.2.2.6	Their most interesting adaptation is an enormous urinary bladder.
7.51.4.2.2.7	Before entering estivation, they fill the bladder with dilute urine, which can amount to one-third of their body weight.
7.51.4.2.2.8	This dilute urine serves as a water reservoir that is gradually reabsorbed into the blood during the long period of estivation.
7.51.4.2.2.9	Aboriginal peoples have learned to locate these buried frogs and use them as an emergency source of water.
7.51.4.2.3.1	Reptiles occupy habitats ranging from aquatic to extremely hot and dry.
7.51.4.2.3.2	In fact, snakes, lizards, and birds are among the most prominent members of many desert faunas.
7.51.4.2.3.3	Three major adaptations have freed reptiles from the close association with water that is necessary for most amphibians (see Key Concept 33.4):
7.51.4.2.4.1	Reptiles are amniotes that do not need fresh water to reproduce because they employ internal fertilization and lay eggs with shells that retard evaporative water loss.
7.51.4.2.5.1	Reptiles have a dry epidermis (skin) that retards evaporative water loss.
7.51.4.2.6.1	Reptiles excrete nitrogenous wastes as uric acid semisolids, losing little water in the process.
7.51.4.3.1.1	Mammals occupy diverse habitats, many of which present special excretory system challenges.
7.51.4.3.1.2	The most challenging environments are those in which water is severely limited.
7.51.4.3.1.3	Mammals have a variety of adaptations to conserve water, but chief among them is the ability to produce urine that is more concentrated than their extracellular fluids.
7.51.4.3.1.4	They are able to concentrate their urine because of adaptations of their kidneys that we will explore in detail in Key Concept 51.5.
7.51.4.3.1.5	To understand how these adaptations work, you must first know the structure and function of the vertebrate nephron.
7.51.4.4.1.1	Urine formation in vertebrate nephrons involves three main processes (Figure 51.7): Figure 51.7 The Vertebrate Nephron
7.51.4.4.2.1	Filtration.
7.51.4.4.2.2	Each nephron has a dense bed of capillaries called a glomerulus (plural glomeruli).
7.51.4.4.2.3	The glomerulus is highly permeable to water, ions, and small molecules but impermeable to large molecules.
7.51.4.4.2.4	Blood pressure drives the movement of water and small-molecular-weight solutes out of the glomerular capillaries.
7.51.4.4.3.1	Tubular reabsorption.
7.51.4.4.3.2	The filtrate from the glomerulus flows into the renal tubule.
7.51.4.4.3.3	Cells in the renal tubule modify the filtrate by reabsorbing specific ions, nutrients, and water, returning these to the blood, and leaving behind and concentrating excess ions and waste products such as urea.
7.51.4.4.4.1	Tubular secretion.
7.51.4.4.4.2	The filtrate in the renal tubule is further modified by tubule cells transporting substances into the tubule.
7.51.4.4.4.3	These are substances that the body needs to excrete.
7.51.4.4.5.1	Blood enters the glomerular capillaries via an afferent arteriole and leaves the glomerulus in an efferent arteriole.
7.51.4.4.5.2	This short vessel is called an arteriole because it feeds another capillary bed, called the peritubular capillaries.
7.51.4.4.5.3	These capillaries intimately surround the renal tubules and deliver substances to the renal tubules that the cells of the tubules secrete into the urine.
7.51.4.4.5.4	The peritubular capillaries also carry away substances that the tubule cells reabsorb from the urine.
7.51.4.5.1.1	The renal tubule begins with Bowman&#8217;s capsule (see Figure 51.7), which encloses the glomerulus (Figure 51.8A and B).
7.51.4.5.1.2	The glomerulus appears to be pushed into Bowman&#8217;s capsule much like a fist pushed into an inflated balloon.
7.51.4.5.1.3	The cells of the capsule that are in direct contact with the glomerular capillaries are called podocytes (Figure 51.8C).
7.51.4.5.1.4	These highly specialized cells have numerous extensions, each with hundreds of fine processes.
7.51.4.5.1.5	The podocytes wrap around the capillaries so that their processes interdigitate and intimately cover the capillaries.
7.51.4.5.2.1	Figure 51.8 A Tour of the Nephron
7.51.4.5.3.1	The glomerulus filters the blood, producing a fluid (the renal filtrate) that lacks cells and large molecules.
7.51.4.5.3.2	The walls of the capillaries, the basal lamina of the capillary endothelium, and the podocytes of Bowman&#8217;s capsule all participate in filtration.
7.51.4.5.3.3	Fenestrations in the walls of the capillaries (see Key Concept 49.4) allow water and many solute molecules, but not red blood cells, to pass through.
7.51.4.5.3.4	The meshwork of the basal lamina and the spaces between the processes of the podocytes are even finer and prevent large molecules from leaving the capillaries (Figure 51.8D).
7.51.4.5.3.5	The arterial pressure of the blood entering the permeable capillaries causes the filtration of water and small molecules out of the glomerular capillaries and into the Bowman&#8217;s capsule.
7.51.4.5.3.6	The glomerular filtration rate is high because blood pressure in the glomerular capillaries is high, and because the capillaries of the glomerulus, along with their covering of podocytes, are more permeable to water than are other capillary beds in the body.
7.51.4.5.4.1	You will recall that marine bony fishes produce very little urine.
7.51.4.5.4.2	The explanation for this is that their kidneys have evolved to have few if any glomeruli, whereas the kidneys of freshwater fishes have many glomeruli.
7.51.4.6.1.1	The composition of the filtrate that enters the renal tubule is similar to that of the blood plasma, except the filtrate lacks high-molecular-weight solutes such as proteins.
7.51.4.6.1.2	Reabsorption and secretion cause the composition of this fluid to change as it passes down the renal tubule.
7.51.4.6.1.3	Cells of the tubule actively reabsorb certain molecules from the tubule fluid (which are returned to the blood flowing through the peritubular capillaries).
7.51.4.6.1.4	For example, glucose and amino acids are reabsorbed.
7.51.4.6.1.5	Most NaCl is reabsorbed.
7.51.4.6.1.6	Other substances in the blood of the peritubular capillaries are actively secreted into the tubule fluid.
7.51.4.6.1.7	An example is para-aminohippuric acid (PAH), which is produced in the liver from benzoic acid, a common food preservative.
7.51.4.6.1.8	Because of the actions of the renal tubules, the excreted urine is very different from the original glomerular filtrate.
7.51.4.6.2.1	51.4 recap
7.51.4.6.3.1	The kidney is the major excretory organ of vertebrates.
7.51.4.6.3.2	Its functional unit is the nephron, which includes a glomerulus that filters blood and a renal tubule that secretes and reabsorbs solutes, modifying the filtrate to produce urine.
7.51.4.6.3.3	As seen in freshwater fishes, the nephron evolved as a mechanism for excreting excess water while conserving valuable solutes.
7.51.4.6.3.4	Vertebrates have various adaptations for conserving water.
7.51.4.6.3.5	Marine bony fishes produce very little urine but lose nitrogenous waste as ammonia across their gills and also excrete salts across their gills.
7.51.4.6.3.6	Marine cartilaginous fishes produce urea and retain it, so their extracellular fluids are hyperosmotic to the environment and therefore take up water by osmosis.
7.51.4.6.3.7	Many terrestrial vertebrates conserve water by excreting nitrogenous waste as uric acid, by minimizing evaporative water loss, and by active secretion of salts.
7.51.4.6.3.8	Mammals have the ability to conserve water by producing urine that is more concentrated than their extracellular fluid.
7.51.4.6.4.1	learning outcomes
7.51.4.6.5.1	You should be able to:
7.51.4.6.6.1	Relate structural and behavioral features of amphibians and reptiles to their abilities to minimize water loss.

7.51.4.6.8.1	Explain the mechanism of filtration of blood plasma from the glomerular capillaries into Bowman&#8217;s capsule.
7.51.4.6.9.1	Explain why the renal filtrate changes in composition as it passes through the nephron.

7.51.4.6.12.1	What are the anatomical components of the filtration mechanism in the glomerulus?
7.51.4.6.13.1	How does the composition of the urine become different from the composition of the blood?
7.51.4.6.14.1	The adaptations that enable the mammalian kidney to produce urine more concentrated than extracellular fluids were important steps in vertebrate evolution, and they were largely achieved through changes in the structure and regional functions of the renal tubules.
7.51.4.6.14.2	These changes converted a kidney that evolved to excrete water into an organ that conserves water.
7.51.4.6.15.1	Chapter 51 continues with
7.51.4.6.16.1	51.5 The Mammalian Kidney Can Produce Concentrated Urine
7.51.5.1.1	Kidneys produce urine and the bladder stores it
7.51.5.2.1	Nephrons have a regular arrangement in the kidney
7.51.5.3.1	Most of the glomerular filtrate is reabsorbed by the proximal convoluted tubule
7.51.5.4.1	The loop of Henle creates a concentration gradient in the renal medulla
7.51.5.5.1	Water permeability of kidney tubules depends on water channels
7.51.5.6.1	The distal convoluted tubule fine-tunes the composition of the urine
7.51.5.7.1	Urine is concentrated in the collecting duct
7.51.5.8.1	The kidneys help regulate acid   base balance
7.51.5.9.1	Kidney failure is treated with dialysis
7.51.5.10.1	Mammals have high body temperatures and high metabolic rates, and therefore have the potential for a high rate of water loss and a high level of nitrogenous waste production.
7.51.5.10.2	Having an excretory system that minimizes water loss made it possible for these highly active species to occupy arid habitats.
7.51.5.11.1	focus your learning
7.51.5.12.1	Nephrons are organized in the kidney so that the glomeruli and major portions of the renal tubules (called convoluted tubules) are in the outer region, or cortex, and straight sections of tubules (called loops of Henle) and collecting ducts are in the inner region, or medulla.
7.51.5.13.1	Most of the filtrate is reabsorbed isosmotically in the proximal convoluted tubule.
7.51.5.14.1	Loops of Henle are countercurrent multipliers that create a concentration gradient in the extracellular fluid.
7.51.5.15.1	As the tubular fluid passes down the collecting duct, water can be reabsorbed into the extracellular fluid to produce a more concentrated urine in the tubule.
7.51.5.16.1	The mammalian kidney functions in conjunction with the lungs to regulate the pH of the extracellular fluid.
7.51.5.1.1.1	Mammalian excretory systems are similar, so we will use that of humans as our example.
7.51.5.1.1.2	Humans have two kidneys at the back of the upper region of the abdominal cavity (Figure 51.9A).
7.51.5.1.1.3	Each kidney filters blood, processes the filtrate into urine, and releases that urine into a duct called the ureter.
7.51.5.1.1.4	The ureter of each kidney leads to the urinary bladder, where the urine is stored until it is excreted through the urethra, a short tube that opens to the outside of the body.
7.51.5.1.1.5	Figure 51.9 The Human Excretory System
7.51.5.1.2.1	Two sphincter muscles surrounding the base of the urethra control urination.
7.51.5.1.2.2	One of these sphincters is a smooth muscle and is controlled by the autonomic nervous system.
7.51.5.1.2.3	As the bladder fills, stretch receptors in the walls of the bladder trigger a spinal reflex that relaxes this sphincter.
7.51.5.1.2.4	This reflex is the only control of urination in infants, hence their frequent &#8220;accidents. &#8221; The other sphincter is a skeletal muscle and is controlled by the voluntary nervous system.
7.51.5.1.2.5	When the bladder is very full, only deliberate conscious effort prevents urination.
7.51.5.1.2.6	Toilet training of children teaches them to control this sphincter.
7.51.5.2.1.1	The kidney is shaped like a kidney bean.
7.51.5.2.1.2	When sliced along its long axis on the midline, its key anatomical features are revealed (Figure 51.9B).
7.51.5.2.1.3	The ureter and the renal artery and renal vein enter the kidney on its concave (punched-in) side.
7.51.5.2.1.4	Inside the kidney, the ureter is continuous with structures that envelop kidney tissues called renal pyramids.
7.51.5.2.1.5	The renal pyramids make up the internal core, or medulla, of the kidney.
7.51.5.2.1.6	The medulla is covered by an outer layer, or cortex, that has a granular appearance.
7.51.5.2.1.7	Between the cortex and the medulla, the renal artery divides into the many arterioles that serve the nephrons.
7.51.5.2.1.8	In this same region, the renal vein collects blood from the many venules that drain the peritubular capillaries.
7.51.5.2.2.1	The organization of nephrons within the kidney is very regular.
7.51.5.2.2.2	All of the glomeruli with their Bowman&#8217;s capsules are located in the cortex.
7.51.5.2.2.3	The initial segments of the renal tubules that come from the Bowman&#8217;s capsules are called the proximal convoluted tubules   &#8220;proximal&#8221; because they are closest to the glomerulus, and &#8220;convoluted&#8221; because they are twisted (Figure 51.9C).
7.51.5.2.2.4	All of the proximal convoluted tubules are located in the cortex.
7.51.5.2.3.1	At the point at which the proximal convoluted tubule enters the medulla, it becomes thin, straight, and descends directly down toward the tip of a renal pyramid.
7.51.5.2.3.2	In the medulla the tubule makes a hairpin turn and ascends back to the cortex, forming what is called a loop of Henle.
7.51.5.2.3.3	Some nephrons have longer loops of Henle than others.
7.51.5.2.3.4	Some 20   30 percent of human nephrons that have glomeruli deep in the cortex (i. e. , near the border with the medulla) have long loops of Henle that go deep into the medulla.
7.51.5.2.3.5	Nephrons that have glomeruli farther up in the cortex generally have short loops of Henle that descend only a short distance into the medulla.
7.51.5.2.3.6	As you will see, the long loops are the critical adaptation of the mammalian nephron that enables the kidney to concentrate the urine.
7.51.5.2.4.1	The ascending limb of the loop of Henle becomes the distal convoluted tubule when it reaches the cortex   &#8220;distal&#8221; because it is farther from the glomerulus.
7.51.5.2.4.2	The distal convoluted tubules of many nephrons join a common collecting duct in the cortex.
7.51.5.2.4.3	The collecting ducts descend back down through the renal pyramid, parallel to and past the tips of the loops of Henle, and empty into a funnel-shaped structure called the pelvis.
7.51.5.2.4.4	Divisions of the pelvis that surround each renal pyramid join together to leave the kidney as the ureter (see Figure 51.9B).
7.51.5.2.5.1	The organization of the blood vessels of the kidney closely parallels the organization of the nephrons (see Figure 51.9C).
7.51.5.2.5.2	Smaller arteries branch from the renal artery and radiate into the cortex, forming the afferent arterioles that carry blood to each glomerulus.
7.51.5.2.5.3	Each glomerulus is drained by an efferent arteriole that gives rise to the peritubular capillaries, most of which surround the proximal and distal convoluted tubules.
7.51.5.2.5.4	The intimate associations of the glomerular and peritubular capillaries with the renal tubules enable exchanges between the blood and the specialized regions of the tubules.
7.51.5.2.6.1	Some of the peritubular capillaries run into the medulla in parallel with the loops of Henle and the collecting ducts, forming a vascular network called the vasa recta.
7.51.5.2.6.2	All of the peritubular capillaries from a nephron join back together into a venule that joins with venules from other nephrons and eventually leads to the renal vein.
7.51.5.2.6.3	As you will see, the concentrating ability of the mammalian kidney depends on water reabsorption in the renal medulla, and the vasa recta are the avenue by which that water gets out of the renal medulla and back into the circulation.
7.51.5.3.1.1	Most of the water and solutes filtered by the glomerulus are reabsorbed and do not appear in the urine.
7.51.5.3.1.2	We can reach this conclusion by comparing the rate of filtration by the glomeruli with the rate of urine production.
7.51.5.3.1.3	The kidneys receive about 1 liter of blood per minute, or about 1,500 liters of blood per day.
7.51.5.3.1.4	How much of this huge volume is filtered out of the glomeruli?
7.51.5.3.1.5	The answer is about 12 percent.
7.51.5.3.1.6	This is still a large volume   180 liters per day!
7.51.5.3.1.7	We normally urinate less than 2 liters per day, so about 99 percent of the fluid volume that is filtered out of the glomerulus is returned to the blood.
7.51.5.3.1.8	Where and how is this enormous amount of fluid reabsorbed?
7.51.5.3.2.1	The proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) is responsible for most of the reabsorption of water and solutes from the glomerular filtrate.
7.51.5.3.2.2	The cells of this section of the renal tubule have many microvilli that increase their apical (facing into the tubule) surface area for reabsorption, and they have many mitochondria   an indication that they are metabolically active.
7.51.5.3.2.3	PCT cells actively transport Na&#43; (with Cl    following) and other solutes, such as glucose and amino acids, out of the tubule fluid.
7.51.5.3.3.1	Almost all glucose and amino acid molecules that are filtered from the blood are actively reabsorbed by PCT cells and transported into the extracellular fluid.
7.51.5.3.3.2	The active transport of solutes from the proximal tubule into the interstitial fluid causes water to follow osmotically.
7.51.5.3.3.3	The water and solutes moved into the interstitial fluid are taken up by the peritubular capillaries and returned to the venous blood.
7.51.5.3.3.4	These processes accomplish the reabsorption of more than 75 percent of the fluid that initially enters the nephron.
7.51.5.3.4.1	Despite the bulk reabsorption of water and solutes by the PCT, the overall osmolarity of the fluid flowing through the PCT does not change.
7.51.5.3.4.2	Thus the process that is occurring in the PCT is called isosmotic reabsorption.
7.51.5.3.4.3	The fluid that enters the loop of Henle has the same osmolarity as the blood plasma, although its composition is different.
7.51.5.3.4.4	How then does the kidney produce urine that is more concentrated than the blood plasma?
7.51.5.4.1.1	Humans can produce urine that is four times more concentrated than their blood plasma.
7.51.5.4.1.2	The vampire bat you encountered at the beginning of this chapter can produce urine that is 15 times more concentrated than its blood plasma (Investigating Life: How Can Vampire Bats Use Blood as Fast Food?).
7.51.5.4.1.3	The concentrating ability of the mammalian kidney arises from a countercurrent multiplier mechanism made possible by the anatomical arrangement of the loops of Henle.
7.51.5.4.1.4	The term &#8220;countercurrent&#8221; refers to the opposing directions of fluid flow in the descending and ascending limbs.
7.51.5.4.1.5	The term &#8220;multiplier&#8221; refers to the ability of this system to create a solute concentration gradient in the renal medulla.

7.51.5.4.5.3	Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Physiology 90: 141   146.
7.51.5.4.6.1	You learned at the beginning of the chapter that vampire bats feed once a day.
7.51.5.4.6.2	After sunset they fly out, search for a victim, and then return to their roost.
7.51.5.4.6.3	This nightly excursion generally takes less than 2 hours.
7.51.5.4.6.4	Therefore in a very short time these small animals must take in a large enough volume of their liquid blood diet to supply their energy and water needs for a 24-hour period.
7.51.5.4.6.5	How do they do it?
7.51.5.4.7.1	HYPOTHESIS Vampire bats maximize their food intake by rapidly excreting water, but they then conserve water by producing a highly concentrated urine while digesting their protein meal.
7.51.5.4.8.1	METHOD
7.51.5.4.9.1	Offer a colony of captive vampire bats a beef blood meal once a day for 2 hours, to mimic the natural once-a-day feeding behavior of the bats.
7.51.5.4.10.1	Do not allow bats access to free water.
7.51.5.4.11.1	Measure the daily amount of blood consumed and the time course of subsequent urine volume and concentration.
7.51.5.4.12.1	RESULTS
7.51.5.4.13.1	The table shows the average body mass and average amount of blood consumed by nine vampire bats over a period of 5   8 days.

7.51.5.4.14.1	CONCLUSION In a short daily feeding period, vampire bats consume on average 60% of their body mass.
7.51.5.4.15.1	work with the data
7.51.5.4.16.1	To consume 60% of body mass and still be able to fly, the bats must rapidly excrete a large percentage of the water content of their food.
7.51.5.4.16.2	The time course of urine flow and its concentration was measured during and after daily feeding for three vampire bats for 1 week and averaged.
7.51.5.4.16.3	Create a double plot of the flow and concentration data as a function of time.

7.51.5.4.17.1	QUESTIONS
7.51.5.4.18.1	If you averaged the urine flow rates over the first hour following the beginning of the meal, and you assumed that the total blood intake was 60% of body mass and body mass was 30 g, what percentage of the ingested volume would be excreted in that first hour?
7.51.5.4.19.1	Considering that the normal osmolarity of interstitial fluid in a mammal is 300 mosm, what is the maximum concentrating factor in these vampire bats?
7.51.5.4.20.1	Three data points are missing in the urine osmolarity curve.
7.51.5.4.20.2	Would it be reasonable to plot these data by connecting the 90-min sample and the 330-min sample with a straight line?
7.51.5.4.20.3	Why or why not?
7.51.5.4.21.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.51.5.4.22.1	The loops of Henle do not themselves produce concentrated urine; rather, they increase the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid in the medulla in a graduated way.
7.51.5.4.22.2	In humans, for example, the extracellular fluid at the top of the medulla bordering the cortex will be about 300 mosm/L (the concentration of blood plasma).
7.51.5.4.22.3	But at the bottom of the medulla, where the loops of Henle make their hairpin turns, the extracellular fluid can be 1,200 mosm/L (Focus: Key Figure 51.10).
7.51.5.4.22.4	How do the loops produce this effect?
7.51.5.4.23.1	focus: key figure Figure 51.10 Concentrating the Urine
7.51.5.4.24.1	A countercurrent multiplier mechanism enables the mammalian kidney to produce urine that is far more concentrated than the blood plasma.
7.51.5.4.24.2	The composition   but not the concentration   of the filtrate is changed by the proximal convoluted tubule, which reabsorbs valuable molecules (including NaCl).
7.51.5.4.24.3	Bulk reabsorption of water follows osmotically.
7.51.5.4.24.4	The urine concentration process begins in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, which reabsorbs NaCl but is impermeable to H2O.
7.51.5.4.24.5	This reabsorbed NaCl creates an osmotic differential that pulls water out of the thin descending limb; NaCl also can diffuse into the thin descending limb, making the fluid in that limb more concentrated.
7.51.5.4.24.6	Through this continuous process, a concentration gradient in the interstitial fluid of the renal medulla is created as indicated by the gradient of color in the medulla.
7.51.5.4.24.7	As urine in the collecting duct passes through this concentration gradient, it can lose water osmotically, becomes more concentrated as indicated by the shading of color, and can become almost as concentrated as the interstitial fluid at the bottom of the renal medulla.
7.51.5.4.25.1	Q: What would be the effect of a drug called a &#8220;loop diuretic&#8221; that blocks the Na&#43; transport in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle?
7.51.5.4.26.1	The cells that make up the different segments of the loop of Henle differ anatomically and functionally.
7.51.5.4.26.2	Cells of the descending limb and the initial cells of the ascending limb are thin, with no microvilli and few mitochondria.
7.51.5.4.26.3	They are not specialized for transport.
7.51.5.4.26.4	Partway up the ascending limb, the cells become specialized for active transport.
7.51.5.4.26.5	These cells are thick and have many mitochondria.
7.51.5.4.26.6	Accordingly, the segments of the loop of Henle are named the thin descending limb, the thin ascending limb, and the thick ascending limb (see Figure 51.9C).
7.51.5.4.27.1	The countercurrent multiplier mechanism is best understood by first considering events occurring in the thick ascending limb (see Figure 51.10, note 1).
7.51.5.4.27.2	The cells of the thick ascending limb reabsorb Na&#43; and Cl    from the tubule fluid and move it into the interstitial fluid.
7.51.5.4.27.3	(In the following discussion, we will distinguish between the two components of extracellular fluid   the blood plasma and the interstitial fluid. )
7.51.5.4.27.4	The thick ascending limb is not permeable to water, so the reabsorption of Na&#43; and Cl    from the tubular fluid raises the concentration of those solutes in the surrounding interstitial fluid and decreases the concentration of the tubular fluid entering the distal convoluted tubule.
7.51.5.4.28.1	The thin descending limb, in contrast, is highly permeable to water but not very permeable to Na&#43; and Cl   .
7.51.5.4.28.2	Since the local interstitial fluid has been made more concentrated by the Na&#43; and Cl    reabsorbed from the neighboring thick ascending limb, water is withdrawn osmotically from the fluid in the descending limb.
7.51.5.4.28.3	Therefore the fluid in the descending limb becomes more concentrated as it flows toward the hairpin turn at the bottom of the renal medulla (see Figure 51.10, note 2).
7.51.5.4.29.1	The thin ascending limb, like the thick ascending limb, is not permeable to water.
7.51.5.4.29.2	It is, however, permeable to Na&#43; and Cl   .
7.51.5.4.29.3	As the concentrated tubule fluid flows up the thin ascending limb, it is more concentrated than the surrounding interstitial fluid, so Na&#43; and Cl    diffuse out.
7.51.5.4.29.4	When the tubule fluid reaches the thick ascending limb, active transport continues to move Na&#43; and Cl    from the tubule fluid to the interstitial fluid.
7.51.5.4.30.1	Because of this countercurrent multiplier mechanism, the tubule fluid reaching the distal convoluted tubule is less concentrated than the blood plasma (see Figure 51.10, note 3), and the solutes that have been left behind in the renal medulla have created a concentration gradient in the interstitial fluid of the medulla (indicated by the background color gradient in Figure 51.10).
7.51.5.4.31.1	You may wonder why the blood flow through the medulla does not wash out the concentration gradient established by the loops of Henle.
7.51.5.4.31.2	The parallel arrangement of the descending and ascending peritubular capillaries in the medulla    the vasa recta   helps preserve the concentration gradient in the medulla.
7.51.5.4.31.3	These capillaries are permeable to both salts and water.
7.51.5.4.31.4	Therefore as blood flows down the descending limb of the vasa recta into the increasingly concentrated interstitial fluid of the medulla, it loses water and gains solutes.
7.51.5.4.31.5	As blood flows up from the bottom of the medulla in the ascending limb of the vasa recta, the opposite happens (water is gained and solutes are lost) because now the blood is more concentrated than the surrounding interstitial fluid (see Figure 51.10, notes 4   6).
7.51.5.4.31.6	The dynamics of this countercurrent exchange of salts and water between the blood in the vasa recta and the interstitial fluids result in little net change in the composition of the interstitial fluid in the medulla.
7.51.5.5.1.1	We have noted that some tubule regions, such as the PCT, are highly permeable to water whereas others, such as the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, are impermeable to water.
7.51.5.5.1.2	What causes these differences in water permeability in different regions of the nephron? *Aquaporins are a class of membrane proteins that form water channels.
7.51.5.5.1.3	Regions of the nephron that are highly permeable to water have greater numbers of aquaporins.
7.51.5.5.1.4	Thus aquaporins are abundant in kidney PCT cells and in descending limbs of the loops of Henle, but not in the ascending limbs of the loop of Henle.
7.51.5.5.2.1	*connect the concepts As explained in Key Concept 6.3, water does not cross cell membranes easily, but aquaporins are protein channels that make cells permeable to water.
7.51.5.5.3.1	As an interesting evolutionary note, aquaporins are also important in maintaining water balance in amphibians.
7.51.5.5.3.2	Many amphibians can gain water from a moist substrate because they have aquaporins in the epithelial cells of their belly skin.
7.51.5.5.3.3	Thus water can cross their skin into the interstitial fluid by osmosis.
7.51.5.6.1.1	The first portion of the distal convoluted tubule is similar to the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.
7.51.5.6.1.2	Na&#43; and Cl    are transported out of the tubule fluid, and water cannot follow.
7.51.5.6.1.3	As a result, the tubule fluid becomes even more dilute.
7.51.5.6.1.4	The later sections of the distal convoluted tubule, however, can be permeable to water, and therefore water can be osmotically drawn from the hypotonic tubule fluid into the interstitial fluid.
7.51.5.6.1.5	As the tubule fluid flows through the distal tubule to the collecting duct, it equilibrates with the osmolarity of the blood plasma.
7.51.5.6.2.1	An important function of the distal tubule is the fine-tuning of the ionic composition of the urine.
7.51.5.6.2.2	Even though bulk reabsorption of substances such as calcium, phosphate, bicarbonate, and potassium occurs in the proximal convoluted tubule, changes in the concentrations of these substances occur in the distal convoluted tubule.
7.51.5.6.2.3	In the case of potassium, for example, if a person is potassium depleted, this ion is reabsorbed in the distal convoluted tubule, but if a person has an abundance of potassium, this ion is secreted in the distal convoluted tubule.
7.51.5.6.2.4	As you will see in Key Concept 51.6, this exchange of K&#43; is controlled by the hormone aldosterone.
7.51.5.6.2.5	Another example is reabsorption of Ca2+ in the distal convoluted tubule, which is controlled by the actions of vitamin D. The fine-tuning of urine composition continues in the collecting duct.
7.51.5.6.2.6	As you can imagine, the list of ion transporters in the distal convoluted tubule is large.
7.51.5.7.1.1	The tubule fluid entering the collecting duct is at about the same solute concentration as the blood plasma, but its solute composition is considerably different from that of the plasma.
7.51.5.7.1.2	The major solute in the tubule fluid is now urea, since salts were reabsorbed earlier in the nephron.
7.51.5.7.1.3	As the tubule fluid flows down the collecting duct, it loses water osmotically to the interstitial fluid, and that water returns to the circulatory system via the vasa recta (see Figure 51.10, note 4).
7.51.5.7.2.1	The concentration gradient established in the renal medulla by the countercurrent multiplier actions of the loops of Henle creates the osmotic potential that withdraws water from the collecting ducts.
7.51.5.7.2.2	The collecting ducts begin in the renal cortex and run through the renal medulla before emptying into the ureter at the tips of the renal pyramids.
7.51.5.7.2.3	During this journey, the solute concentration of the surrounding interstitial fluid increases, and more and more water can be absorbed from the urine in the collecting duct.
7.51.5.7.2.4	By the time the urine reaches the ureter, it can become greatly concentrated, with urea as the major solute.
7.51.5.7.3.1	As water is withdrawn from the collecting duct, some urea also leaks out into the medullary interstitial fluid, adding to its osmotic potential.
7.51.5.7.3.2	This urea diffuses back into the loop of Henle and is returned to the collecting duct.
7.51.5.7.3.3	The recycling of urea in the renal medulla contributes significantly to the concentration gradient and therefore the ability of the kidney to concentrate the urine in the collecting duct.
7.51.5.7.3.4	The ability of a mammal to concentrate its urine is determined by the maximum concentration gradient it can establish in its renal medulla.
7.51.5.8.1.1	Besides regulating salt and water balance and excreting nitrogenous wastes, the kidneys have another important role: they regulate the hydrogen ion concentration (the pH) of the extracellular fluids. pH is a critical variable because it influences the structure and function of proteins.
7.51.5.8.2.1	One way to minimize pH changes in a chemical solution is to add a buffer   a substance that can either absorb or release hydrogen ions (see Key Concept 2.4).
7.51.5.8.2.2	The major buffer in the blood is bicarbonate ions (HCO3   ; see Figure 48.14) that are formed from the dissociation of carbonic acid, which in turn is formed by the hydration of CO2 according to the following equilibrium reaction:
7.51.5.8.3.1	CO2 + H2O &#8764; H2CO3 &#8764; H&#43; + HCO3
7.51.5.8.4.1	From this equation, you can see that if excess hydrogen ions are added to this reaction mixture, the reaction will move to the left and absorb the excess H&#43;.
7.51.5.8.4.2	If hydrogen ions are removed from the reaction mixture, however, the reaction will move to the right and supply more H&#43;.
7.51.5.8.5.1	The HCO3    buffer system is important for controlling the pH of the blood, and therefore of the interstitial fluids as well, because the reaction can be pushed to the right and pulled to the left physiologically.
7.51.5.8.5.2	The lungs control the levels of CO2 in the blood, thus altering the acid portion of the reaction.
7.51.5.8.5.3	CO2 is considered the acid portion of the reaction because if you add additional CO2, the reaction shifts to the right, producing more H&#43; ions.
7.51.5.8.5.4	The kidneys control the base portion of the reaction by removing H&#43; from the blood and returning HCO3    to the blood.
7.51.5.8.5.5	How does this occur?
7.51.5.8.6.1	HCO3    is filtered in the glomerulus and is therefore present in the tubule fluid.
7.51.5.8.6.2	As illustrated in Figure 51.11A, tubule cells transport H&#43; into the tubule fluid in exchange for Na&#43;.
7.51.5.8.6.3	In the tubule, the excreted H&#43; combines with the filtered HCO3    to produce H2CO3 that then disassociates into H2O and CO2.
7.51.5.8.6.4	The CO2 diffuses into the tubule cells, where in the presence of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase it produces HCO3    that is transported out of the basal end of the cell into the interstitial fluid and thence to the blood.
7.51.5.8.6.5	Thus for each H&#43; secreted into the tubule fluid, a HCO3    ion is released into the blood.
7.51.5.8.7.1	Figure 51.11 The Kidney Excretes Acids and Conserves Bases
7.51.5.8.8.1	Another mechanism for H&#43; secretion and HCO3    reabsorption involves ammonium ions (NH4&#43;).
7.51.5.8.8.2	The metabolism of glutamine in tubule cells produces NH4&#43; and HCO3    (Figure 51.11B).
7.51.5.8.8.3	The HCO3    is reabsorbed into the interstitial fluid.
7.51.5.8.8.4	The NH4&#43; is transported into the tubule fluid and combines with Cl   , which is excreted in the urine.
7.51.5.8.8.5	This process results in the addition of a new HCO3    ion to the blood.
7.51.5.8.8.6	The NH4&#43; is transported into the tubules by means of an NH4&#43; transporter.
7.51.5.9.1.1	Loss of kidney function (renal failure) results in the retention of salts and water (hence high blood pressure), retention of urea (uremic poisoning), and a decreasing pH (acidosis).
7.51.5.9.1.2	A person who suffers complete renal failure will die within 2 weeks if not treated.
7.51.5.9.1.3	A drastic but highly successful treatment is kidney transplant, but it is usually necessary to sustain a patient for considerable time while waiting for a kidney to become available.
7.51.5.9.1.4	Therefore artificial kidneys, or renal dialysis machines, are essential modes of treatment.
7.51.5.9.2.1	In a dialysis machine, the patient&#8217;s blood flows through many small channels made of semipermeable membranes (Figure 51.12).
7.51.5.9.2.2	A dialysis solution flows on the other side of these membranes, through which small molecules can diffuse.
7.51.5.9.2.3	Molecules and ions diffuse from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration, so the composition of the dialysis fluid is crucial.
7.51.5.9.2.4	The concentrations of the molecules or ions that need to be conserved must be at the same concentration in the dialysis fluid as they are in the blood.
7.51.5.9.2.5	The concentrations of molecules and ions that need to be removed from the blood are zero in the dialysis fluid.
7.51.5.9.2.6	The total osmotic potential of the dialysis fluid must equal that of the blood plasma.
7.51.5.9.3.1	Figure 51.12 Renal Dialysis
7.51.5.9.4.1	About 500 mL of the patient&#8217;s blood is in the dialysis machine at any one time, and the unit processes several hundred milliliters of blood per minute.
7.51.5.9.4.2	A patient with no kidney function must be on the dialysis machine for 4   6 hours three times a week.
7.51.5.9.5.1	51.5 recap
7.51.5.9.6.1	The anatomical organization of nephrons makes it possible for the mammalian kidney to produce a urine more concentrated than the blood, thereby conserving water to maintain extracellular fluid volume.
7.51.5.9.6.2	Bulk reabsorption of salts, other valuable solutes, and water takes place in the proximal convoluted tubule.
7.51.5.9.6.3	The loops of Henle act as a countercurrent multiplier, creating a concentration gradient of the interstitial fluids in the renal medulla.
7.51.5.9.6.4	Collecting ducts run through the renal medulla and lose water osmotically to the surrounding interstitial fluids, concentrating the urine.
7.51.5.9.6.5	The renal tubules contribute to acid   base balance by excreting H&#43; ions.

7.51.5.9.16.1	How does the active secretion of H&#43; ions by the renal tubule cells result in an increase in the bicarbonate concentration in the blood?
7.51.5.9.17.1	The kidneys contribute to homeostasis in several ways, including regulating extracellular fluid volume, maintaining the osmotic concentration and ionic composition of the extracellular fluid, and regulating pH.
7.51.5.9.17.2	As you will see next, the kidneys also play a major role in regulating blood pressure.
7.51.5.9.18.1	Chapter 51 continues with
7.51.5.9.19.1	51.6 Kidney Function Is Regulated
7.51.6.1.1	Glomerular filtration rate is regulated
7.51.6.2.1	Regulation of GFR uses feedback information from the distal tubule
7.51.6.3.1	Blood osmolarity and blood pressure are regulated by ADH
7.51.6.4.1	The heart produces a hormone that helps lower blood pressure
7.51.6.5.1	Several regulatory mechanisms act on the kidneys to maintain blood pressure, blood osmolarity, and blood composition.
7.51.6.5.2	We will discuss these mechanisms separately, but keep in mind that they are always working together.
7.51.6.6.1	focus your learning
7.51.6.7.1	Circulating renin initiates activation of angiotensin, which acts in several ways to increase blood pressure.
7.51.6.8.1	The kidney autoregulates its vascular resistance to maintain constancy of glomerular filtration rate.
7.51.6.9.1	Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) controls urine concentration in response to blood pressure and blood osmolarity.
7.51.6.1.1.1	If the kidneys stop filtering blood, they cannot accomplish any of their functions.
7.51.6.1.1.2	The maintenance of a constant glomerular filtration rate (GFR) depends on an adequate blood supply to the kidneys at an adequate blood pressure.
7.51.6.1.1.3	Renal arteries usually deliver blood to the kidneys at high pressure because they are early branches off the aorta.
7.51.6.1.1.4	In addition, autoregulatory mechanisms ensure adequate blood supply and blood pressure for kidney function regardless of what is happening elsewhere in the body.
7.51.6.1.1.5	The kidney&#8217;s autoregulatory adjustments compensate for decreases in cardiac output or decreases in blood pressure so that the GFR remains constant.
7.51.6.1.1.6	Figure 51.13 The Renin   Angiotensin   Aldosterone System Helps Regulate GFR
7.51.6.1.2.1	One autoregulatory mechanism is the dilation (expansion) of the afferent renal arterioles when blood pressure falls.
7.51.6.1.2.2	This dilation decreases the resistance in the arterioles and helps maintain blood pressure in the glomerulus.
7.51.6.1.2.3	If arteriole dilation does not keep the GFR from falling, the kidney releases an enzyme, renin, into the blood.
7.51.6.1.2.4	Renin converts a circulating protein, angiotensinogen, into angiotensin I, which is then acted on by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the lungs and other tissues to form the active hormone angiotensin II, or simply angiotensin (Figure 51.13).
7.51.6.1.2.5	Angiotensin has several effects that help restore the GFR to normal:
7.51.6.1.3.1	It constricts the efferent renal arterioles, raising the resistance for blood leaving the glomerulus.
7.51.6.1.3.2	Like putting a finger over the end of a garden hose, this restriction of drainage elevates blood pressure in the glomerular capillaries.
7.51.6.1.4.1	It constricts peripheral blood vessels all over the body, an action that elevates blood pressure.
7.51.6.1.5.1	It stimulates the adrenal cortex to release the hormone aldosterone.
7.51.6.1.5.2	Aldosterone stimulates sodium reabsorption by the kidney, making its reabsorption of water more effective.
7.51.6.1.5.3	Enhanced water reabsorption helps maintain blood volume and therefore blood pressure.
7.51.6.1.6.1	It acts on the brain to stimulate thirst.
7.51.6.1.6.2	Increased water intake in response to thirst increases blood volume and blood pressure.
7.51.6.1.7.1	Thus the renin   angiotensin   aldosterone system, or RAAS, coordinates many responses to maintain blood pressure and kidney function.
7.51.6.2.1.1	A remarkable anatomical feature of the nephron is that where its renal tubule returns to the cortex and becomes the distal convoluted tubule, it makes contact with the afferent and efferent arterioles of its glomerulus.
7.51.6.2.1.2	At this location the cells of the tubule are modified to form a structure called the macula densa (see Figure 51.13), and the arteriole cells are also modified and are called juxtaglomerular cells.
7.51.6.2.1.3	The macula densa cells sense the concentration of NaCl in the fluid entering the distal convoluted tubule.
7.51.6.2.1.4	If GFR is high, flow through the loop of Henle is high and the cells of the thick ascending limb cannot reabsorb all of the NaCl passing through it.
7.51.6.2.1.5	If GFR is low, flow through the loop of Henle is slower and the cells of the thick ascending limb can reabsorb more of the NaCl.
7.51.6.2.1.6	If the NaCl level in the distal convoluted tubule drops too low, the macula densa cells signal the juxtaglomerular cells to release renin and trigger the RAAS response.
7.51.6.2.1.7	Thus the concentration of NaCl in the fluid passing over the macula densa is a function of GFR and is information that enables fine control of the RAAS system.
7.51.6.3.1.1	Cells in the hypothalamus can stimulate the release of a hormone called antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also called vasopressin) from the posterior pituitary.
7.51.6.3.1.2	ADH stimulates cells of the collecting duct to insert aquaporins (water channels) into their cell membranes.
7.51.6.3.1.3	The aquaporins increase the permeability of these membranes to water, and therefore more water is reabsorbed from the collecting duct fluid into the interstitial fluid of the renal medulla.
7.51.6.3.1.4	The higher the circulating levels of ADH, the greater the number of aquaporins.
7.51.6.3.1.5	Various factors can stimulate or inhibit the release of ADH.
7.51.6.3.1.6	Of key importance to kidney function are (1) osmoreceptors that monitor blood osmolarity and (2) stretch receptors that monitor blood pressure (Figure 51.14).
7.51.6.3.1.7	Figure 51.14 Antidiuretic Hormone Increases Blood Pressure and Promotes Water Reabsorption
7.51.6.3.2.1	Osmoreceptor neurons in the hypothalamus are activated by a rise in blood osmolarity, and they increase the release of ADH.
7.51.6.3.2.2	ADH helps regulate blood osmolarity by controlling water reabsorption.
7.51.6.3.2.3	The osmoreceptors also stimulate thirst.
7.51.6.3.2.4	The resulting water retention and water intake dilute the blood as they expand blood volume.
7.51.6.3.3.1	Stretch receptors in the walls of the aorta and the carotid arteries (see Figure 49.19) that detect an increase in blood pressure will inhibit the release of ADH.
7.51.6.3.3.2	With less circulating ADH, less water is reabsorbed, which increases urine volume and decreases blood volume, hence lowering blood pressure.
7.51.6.3.4.1	If blood pressure falls, as when you lose blood volume through hemorrhage or excessive evaporative water loss, activity of the stretch receptors in the aorta and carotid arteries decreases.
7.51.6.3.4.2	Input via cranial nerves to the hypothalamus from these receptors inhibits the release of ADH, so when the firing rates of these stretch receptors fall, ADH release increases.
7.51.6.3.4.3	More ADH results in more efficient water reabsorption and therefore a protection of blood volume and blood pressure.
7.51.6.3.5.1	Alcohol inhibits ADH release, explaining why excessive beer drinking leads to excessive urination and dehydration, which contributes to the symptoms of a hangover.
7.51.6.3.6.1	As already mentioned, the presence of aquaporins in cell membranes determines their water permeability.
7.51.6.3.6.2	Aquaporins play an important and unique role in the collecting duct.
7.51.6.3.6.3	Several members of the aquaporin family of water channels are found in the cell membranes of the collecting duct cells.
7.51.6.3.6.4	At least two aquaporins (AQP-3 and AQP-4) are localized in the basolateral membranes (facing the blood vessels).
7.51.6.3.6.5	A different aquaporin, AQP-2, is found in the apical cell membranes (facing into the tubule).
7.51.6.3.6.6	The presence of AQP-2 in these membranes is controlled by ADH (Figure 51.15).

7.51.6.3.13.1	Isolate collecting ducts from rat kidney.
7.51.6.3.14.1	Use immunochemical staining to localize the AQP-2 aquaporins in collecting duct cells both with and without the presence of ADH.
7.51.6.3.14.2	Also localize the aquaporins after ADH is applied and then washed away.
7.51.6.3.15.1	Measure the water permeability of the collecting duct cells under the same three conditions.
7.51.6.3.16.1	RESULTS
7.51.6.3.17.1	CONCLUSION In the absence of ADH, AQP-2 is sequestered intracellularly.
7.51.6.3.17.2	When ADH is present, AQP-2 channels are inserted into cell membranes, making the cells more permeable to water.
7.51.6.3.18.1	When ADH levels are low, such as when a person is well hydrated, most of the AQP-2 protein is sequestered in the membranes of intracellular vesicles, and the collecting duct permeability is low.
7.51.6.3.18.2	A rise in ADH levels stimulates the insertion of these vesicles along with their AQP-2 channels into the apical cell membranes.
7.51.6.3.18.3	As a result, the membranes become more permeable to water.
7.51.6.3.18.4	Water that enters the collecting duct cells passes into the interstitial fluid through the aquaporins in the basolateral membranes.
7.51.6.3.18.5	ADH also stimulates the synthesis of new AQP-2 proteins.
7.51.6.3.18.6	Thus circulating ADH controls the number of AQP-2 water channels in the cell membranes of the collecting duct cells, and therefore the permeability of the collecting duct to water.
7.51.6.4.1.1	You may not think of the heart as an endocrine organ, but it is.
7.51.6.4.1.2	When blood volume is high, blood pressure is high, putting strain on the heart.
7.51.6.4.1.3	Under these conditions, the increased venous return stretches the atria of the heart.
7.51.6.4.1.4	When the atrial muscle fibers are over-stretched, they release a peptide hormone called atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP).
7.51.6.4.1.5	This peptide hormone enters the circulation, and in the kidney it decreases the reabsorption of sodium.
7.51.6.4.1.6	If less sodium is reabsorbed, less water is reabsorbed, and more passes into the urine.
7.51.6.4.1.7	Thus ANP has the effect of lowering blood volume and therefore blood pressure.
7.51.6.4.2.1	51.6 recap
7.51.6.4.3.1	Glomerular filtration is essential for kidney function and is sustained by autoregulatory mechanisms.
7.51.6.4.3.2	These autoregulatory mechanisms include changes in dilation and constriction of the glomerular afferent arterioles and hormonal control over constriction of the efferent glomerular arteriole mediated by the renin   angiotensin   aldosterone system (RAAS).
7.51.6.4.3.3	Angiotensin controls the release of aldosterone, which controls sodium reabsorption.
7.51.6.4.3.4	Sensors that monitor blood pressure and blood osmolarity stimulate or inhibit the release of ADH, which controls the water permeability of the collecting duct.

7.51.6.4.5.1	You should be able to:
7.51.6.4.6.1	Describe how renin, angiotensin, and aldosterone affect glomerular filtration rate and blood pressure.
7.51.6.4.7.1	Given an event that lowers blood pressure, predict the response of the renin   angiotensin   aldosterone system.
7.51.6.4.8.1	Describe ADH&#8217;s role in regulating kidney function in response to changes in blood osmolarity or blood pressure.
7.51.6.4.9.1	What are the mechanisms whereby the afferent and efferent arterioles regulate the GFR, and how are those responses controlled?
7.51.6.4.10.1	Aldosterone stimulates activity of the Na&#43;/K&#43; exchangers in the distal convoluted tubule and the initial segments of the collecting ducts.
7.51.6.4.10.2	Aldosterone release is triggered by angiotensin.
7.51.6.4.10.3	Given this information, what is the significance of the fact that the Na+/K+ exchanger in the tubule cells secretes two K&#43; ions for every three Na&#43; ions it reabsorbs?
7.51.6.4.11.1	If you drank a lot of salty chicken broth that had an osmotic concentration of 300 mosm/L, what two mechanisms would play roles in the response of your kidneys to excrete the excess fluid volume and excess Na&#43;?
7.51.6.4.11.2	Explain your answer.
7.51.6.4.12.1	investigatinglife
7.51.6.4.13.1	How does the excretory system of vampire bats process their high-protein liquid diet?
7.51.6.4.14.1	As we described in the opening story, vampire bats conserve water by producing urine that can be as much as 15 times more concentrated than their blood.
7.51.6.4.14.2	For comparison, the maximum urine concentration of humans is about four times that of the blood.
7.51.6.4.15.1	Recall from Key Concept 51.5 that the mammalian body&#8217;s ability to produce concentrated urine depends on the concentration gradient set up in the renal medulla by the loops of Henle.
7.51.6.4.15.2	An important adaptation for increasing the concentration gradient is to increase the lengths of the loops of Henle relative to overall kidney size.
7.51.6.4.15.3	Some tiny desert gerbils, for example, have such extremely long loops of Henle that the renal pyramid (each of the rodent kidneys has only one, in contrast to humans) extends far out of the concave surface of the kidney and into the ureter (Figure 51.16).
7.51.6.4.15.4	The large concentration gradient that results draws most of the water out of the urine as it passes down the collecting duct.
7.51.6.4.15.5	Desert gerbils are so effective in conserving water that they can survive on the water released by the metabolism of their food.
7.51.6.4.15.6	Figure 51.16 The Ability to Concentrate
7.51.6.4.16.1	The vampire bat kidney is also particularly good at concentrating urea.
7.51.6.4.16.2	Within minutes after feeding, the urea concentration in its urine can increase by more than 500-fold.
7.51.6.4.17.1	Future directions
7.51.6.4.18.1	Understanding the diverse mechanisms whereby physiological systems are controlled and regulated can contribute to the discovery and development of new pharmaceuticals.
7.51.6.4.18.2	The renal system is an example.
7.51.6.4.18.3	Many diseases involve problems with salt and water balance.
7.51.6.4.18.4	A common problem is water retention.
7.51.6.4.18.5	A large number of drugs have been developed that increase the excretion of water in urine, such as occurs naturally in vampire bats.
7.51.6.4.18.6	These drugs are called diuretics, and since they act through different mechanisms, they have different effects on Na&#43;, K&#43;, and Ca2+ levels in the blood, which can cause serious side effects.
7.51.6.4.18.7	Excessive loss of K&#43;, for example, can lead to heart arrhythmia, muscle weakness, and paralysis.
7.51.6.4.18.8	Excessive retention of K&#43; can also lead to heart arrhythmia, along with muscle cramps and paralysis.
7.51.6.4.18.9	Loss of too much Na&#43; can result in central nervous system deficits.
7.51.6.4.18.10	Too much Ca2+ has many negative side effects, ranging from depression and fatigue to vomiting and gout.
7.51.6.4.18.11	Thus it is important to understand how drugs work on physiological systems, to avoid negative side effects.

7.51.6.4.20.1	51 Chapter Summary
7.51.summary.1.1	51.1 Excretory Systems Regulate Osmotic and Ionic Concentrations
7.51.summary.2.1	Excretory systems maintain the osmolarity and volume of the extracellular fluids and eliminate the waste products of nitrogen metabolism through the processes of filtration, reabsorption, and secretion.
7.51.summary.2.2	Urine is the output of excretory systems.
7.51.summary.3.1	There is no active transport of water, so water must be moved across membranes by a difference in either osmolarity or pressure.
7.51.summary.4.1	Water enters and leaves cells by osmosis.
7.51.summary.4.2	To achieve cellular water balance, animals must maintain the osmolarity of their extracellular fluids within an acceptable range.
7.51.summary.5.1	Marine animals can be osmoconformers or osmoregulators.
7.51.summary.5.2	Freshwater animals must be osmoregulators and must continually excrete water and conserve salts.
7.51.summary.5.3	Terrestrial animals are osmoregulators, but the nature of their regulation depends on environment and lifestyle.
7.51.summary.5.4	Review Figure 51.1
7.51.summary.6.1	Apart from regulating osmolarity of cells and extracellular fluids, animals must also regulate their ionic composition by conserving some ions and secreting others.
7.51.summary.6.2	Salt glands are adaptations for secretion of NaCl.
7.51.summary.6.3	Review Figure 51.2
7.51.summary.7.1	51.2 Animals Excrete Nitrogen as Ammonia, Urea, or Uric Acid
7.51.summary.8.1	Aquatic animals that breathe water can eliminate nitrogenous wastes such as ammonia by diffusion across their gill membranes.
7.51.summary.8.2	Terrestrial animals and some aquatic animals must detoxify ammonia by converting it to urea or uric acid before excretion.
7.51.summary.8.3	Review Figure 51.3
7.51.summary.9.1	Depending on the form in which they excrete their nitrogenous wastes, animals are classified as ammonotelic, ureotelic, or uricotelic.
7.51.summary.10.1	51.3 Invertebrate Excretory Systems Use Filtration, Secretion, and Reabsorption
7.51.summary.11.1	The protonephridia of flatworms consist of flame cells and excretory tubules.
7.51.summary.11.2	Extracellular fluid is filtered into the tubules, which process the filtrate to produce dilute urine.
7.51.summary.11.3	Review Figure 51.4
7.51.summary.12.1	In annelid worms, blood pressure causes filtration of the blood across capillary walls.
7.51.summary.12.2	The filtrate enters the coelomic cavity, where it is taken up by metanephridia, which alter the composition of the filtrate by active transport mechanisms.
7.51.summary.12.3	Review Figure 51.5, Activity 51.1
7.51.summary.13.1	The Malpighian tubules of insects receive ions and nitrogenous wastes by active transport across the tubule cells.
7.51.summary.13.2	Water follows by osmosis.
7.51.summary.13.3	Ions and water are reabsorbed from the rectum, so the insect excretes semisolid wastes.
7.51.summary.13.4	Review Figure 51.6
7.51.summary.14.1	51.4 The Nephron Is the Basic Functional Unit of Vertebrate Excretory Systems
7.51.summary.15.1	Marine bony fishes produce little urine.
7.51.summary.15.2	Cartilaginous fishes retain urea and TMAO, so the osmolarity of their body fluids remains close to that of seawater.
7.51.summary.16.1	Reptiles, including birds, have skin with low water permeability and excrete nitrogenous wastes as uric acid in a semisolid form.
7.51.summary.17.1	Mammals produce urine that is more concentrated than their extracellular fluids.
7.51.summary.18.1	The nephron, the functional unit of the vertebrate kidney, consists of a glomerulus, in which blood is filtered, a renal tubule, which use processes of active secretion and reabsorption to convert the glomerular filtrate into urine to be excreted, and a system of peritubular capillaries, which surround the tubule and support its functions of secretion and reabsorption.
7.51.summary.18.2	Review Figures 51.7, Activity 51.2
7.51.summary.19.1	51.5 The Mammalian Kidney Can Produce Concentrated Urine
7.51.summary.20.1	The concentrating ability of the mammalian kidney is a function of its anatomy, which enables countercurrent exchange.
7.51.summary.21.1	The glomeruli and the proximal and distal convoluted tubules are located in the cortex of the kidney.
7.51.summary.21.2	Certain molecules are actively reabsorbed from the glomerular filtrate by the tubule cells, and other molecules are actively secreted.
7.51.summary.21.3	Straight sections of renal tubules called loops of Henle and collecting ducts are arranged in parallel in the medulla of the kidney.
7.51.summary.21.4	Review Figure 51.9, Activity 51.3
7.51.summary.22.1	Salts, water, and valuable molecules such as glucose and amino acids are reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule without the renal filtrate becoming more concentrated, although its composition changes.
7.51.summary.23.1	The loops of Henle create a concentration gradient in the interstitial fluid of the renal medulla by a countercurrent multiplier mechanism.
7.51.summary.23.2	Urine flowing down the collecting ducts to the ureter is concentrated by the osmotic reabsorption of water caused by the concentration gradient in the surrounding interstitial fluid.
7.51.summary.23.3	Review Focus: Key Figure 51.10, Animation 51.1
7.51.summary.24.1	Hydrogen ions secreted by the renal tubules are buffered in the urine by bicarbonate and other chemical buffering systems.
7.51.summary.24.2	Review Figure 51.11
7.51.summary.25.1	51.6 Kidney Function Is Regulated
7.51.summary.26.1	Kidney function in mammals is controlled by autoregulatory mechanisms that maintain a constant high glomerular filtration rate (GFR) even if blood pressure varies.
7.51.summary.27.1	The RAAS is an important autoregulatory mechanism.
7.51.summary.27.2	Renin is released by the kidney when blood pressure falls.
7.51.summary.27.3	Renin activates angiotensin, which causes the constriction of efferent glomerular arterioles and peripheral blood vessels, causes the release of aldosterone (which enhances water reabsorption), and stimulates thirst.
7.51.summary.27.4	Review Figure 51.13, Activity 51.4
7.51.summary.28.1	Changes in blood pressure and osmolarity influence the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which controls the permeability of the collecting duct to water and therefore the amount of water that is reabsorbed from the urine.
7.51.summary.28.2	ADH stimulates the expression of and controls the intracellular location of aquaporins, which serve as water channels in the membranes of collecting duct cells.
7.51.summary.28.3	Review Figures 51.14, 51.15
7.51.summary.29.1	When the volume of blood returning to the heart increases and stretches the atrial walls, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is released, which causes increased excretion of salt and water.

7.51.summary.33.1	Review
7.51.summary.34.1	51.5 As the tubular fluid passes down the collecting duct, water can be reabsorbed into the extracellular fluid to produce a more concentrated urine in the tubule.
7.51.summary.35.1	Original Paper: Schmidt-Nielsen, B. and R. O&#8217;Dell. 1961.
7.51.summary.35.2	Structure and concentrating mechanism in the mammalian kidney.
7.51.summary.35.3	American Journal of Physiology 200: 1119   1124.
7.51.summary.36.1	The ability of a mammalian kidney to produce concentrated urine is directly related to the countercurrent multiplier mechanism found in the loops of Henle.
7.51.summary.36.2	Because of the way this mechanism works, it could be hypothesized that the longer the loops of Henle, the more concentrated the urine can become.
7.51.summary.36.3	Since bigger kidneys should have the longest loops, a large mammal, such as an elephant, should be able to produce much more concentrated urine than a small mammal, like a shrew.
7.51.summary.36.4	However, some of the mammals that live in the driest conditions on Earth are very small.
7.51.summary.36.5	How can these small mammals conserve water by producing highly concentrated urine with such tiny kidneys?
7.51.summary.37.1	To account for body size, scientists refined their hypothesis by saying that it wasn&#8217;t just the total length of the loops of Henle, but the &#8220;relative&#8221; length compared with the rest of the kidney.
7.51.summary.37.2	The loops of Henle are found only in the medulla of the kidney, so the loops can be only as long as the medulla is thick.
7.51.summary.37.3	To normalize the data across different-sized mammals, a new measurement called the relative medullary thickness (RMT) was conceived.
7.51.summary.37.4	The RMT is equal to the thickness of the medulla divided by width &#215; length &#215; thickness of the whole kidney.
7.51.summary.38.1	On further study, it was also noticed that in many species not all of the loops of Henle extend the full length of the medulla.
7.51.summary.38.2	Some are shorter than others.
7.51.summary.38.3	This presented a second hypothesis, namely that the ability to concentrate urine could be related to the number of long loops of Henle compared with short loops of Henle.
7.51.summary.38.4	In other words, the higher the percent of long loops to short, the higher the possible concentration of urine.
7.51.summary.39.1	To gather evidence in support of one hypothesis over the other, scientists performed many measurements on various-sized mammals from different environments.
7.51.summary.39.2	The scientists deprived the mammals of water to find the limit of each mammal&#8217;s ability to concentrate urine.
7.51.summary.39.3	A test called the freezing point depression (FPD) was used to measure urine concentration.
7.51.summary.39.4	Fresh water freezes at 0&#0176;C, but the more solutes that are added to the water, the lower the temperature must be to get the solution to freeze.
7.51.summary.39.5	So the FPD of urine samples reveals their concentrations.
7.51.summary.39.6	The results of all of these tests are seen in the table.

7.52.10.1	An Instinct to Learn
7.52.11.1	A springtime joy is hearing birds sing.
7.52.11.2	Why do they do it?
7.52.11.3	Male songbirds use species-specific song to compete with other males for territory.
7.52.11.4	They also sing to attract mates.
7.52.11.5	Females may not sing, but they recognize the songs of their own species.
7.52.11.6	Males of most species, such as the white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys), must learn their song, but what they can learn is influenced by their genes, and when they can learn it is influenced by their physiology.
7.52.11.7	A hatchling in the nest hears his father and other white-crowned sparrows singing.
7.52.11.8	He also hears the songs of many other bird species.
7.52.11.9	He does not sing until he approaches sexual maturity almost a year later, and when he does, he sings his father&#8217;s type of song and not that of other species.
7.52.11.10	His first attempts at song are poor, but by trial and error he gradually matches his song to the one stored in his memory, even though other species are singing in his environment.
7.52.11.11	His singing talent depends on two critical conditions: he must hear his species-specific song in the first 2 months of life, and he must be able to hear himself as he develops his song.
7.52.11.12	These are both learning experiences, but the bird&#8217;s genes play an important role too.
7.52.12.1	Male white-crowned sparrows raised alone in the laboratory and exposed to recordings of unrelated species will not learn any of those song templates even if they are played over and over.
7.52.12.2	But if in that cacophony of songs, a bird&#8217;s species-specific song is played just a few times, he will sing that song the following spring.
7.52.12.3	Thus male white-crowned sparrows must learn their song, but a genetic predisposition ensures that they learn the song of their own species.
7.52.13.1	An important reason why males learn only their species-specific song is that the females also listen to their father&#8217;s songs when they are nestlings.
7.52.13.2	When they mature, they choose mates that sing like their fathers did.
7.52.13.3	But how does one female chose her specific mate?
7.52.13.4	There is variation in male songs, and some components of songs seem sexier than others.
7.52.13.5	Also, the way the songs are performed may differ among individuals and in different social contexts.
7.52.13.6	As in humans, variability surely plays a role in mate choice.
7.52.14.1	How does social context influence the learning and expression of birdsong?

7.52.16.1	52.1 Ethology Led to Modern Behavioral Biology
7.52.1.1.1	Conditioned reflexes are a simple behavioral mechanism
7.52.1.2.1	Ethologists focused on the behavior of animals in their natural environment
7.52.1.3.1	Ethologists probed the causes of behavior
7.52.1.4.1	Humans have studied animal behavior since prehistoric times.
7.52.1.4.2	Understanding the habits of potential prey, as well as those of their predators, was of great value to hunters.
7.52.1.4.3	Appreciation of behavioral traits led to the domestication of animal species.
7.52.1.4.4	Accounts of animal behaviors such as seasonal appearances and disappearances, mating displays, aggression, prey capture, parental care, and communication are found throughout recorded history.
7.52.1.4.5	Yet the scientific study of animal behavior did not truly get under way until the early 1900s.
7.52.1.5.1	focus your learning
7.52.1.6.1	Ethology is the study of natural behaviors in natural species.
7.52.1.7.1	Behaviors have proximate and ultimate causes.
7.52.1.1.1.1	In the late 1800s the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov used dogs to study the neural control of digestive juice secretion.
7.52.1.1.1.2	Of course his dogs salivated when they smelled food, but Pavlov observed that they also salivated whenever the technician who routinely fed the dogs entered the room   even when no food was present.
7.52.1.1.1.3	Following up this observation, Pavlov substituted a sound stimulus for the technician; a metronome ticked while the dogs were fed.
7.52.1.1.1.4	After several trials, the dogs salivated when they heard the metronome, even if no food was offered.
7.52.1.1.2.1	Salivation in response to the sight, smell, or taste of food is a natural reflex response to a stimulus, but salivation in response to a sound was a learned response.
7.52.1.1.2.2	The pairing of a sound with the experience of receiving food conditioned the dogs&#8217; nervous systems to generate a response, which Pavlov dubbed the conditioned reflex (Figure 52.1).
7.52.1.1.2.3	The natural stimulus   food in this case   became known as the unconditioned stimulus, and the unnatural stimulus was termed the conditioned stimulus.
7.52.1.1.2.4	Pavlov received a Nobel prize in 1904 for his work showing that a simple behavior controlled by the nervous system could be modified through experience.
7.52.1.1.2.5	This work stimulated much new research because Pavlov had developed an experimental model of learning.
7.52.1.1.2.6	Figure 52.1 The Conditioned Reflex
7.52.1.1.3.1	Going beyond the conditioning of autonomic reflexes, the psychologist B. F. Skinner showed that many behaviors could become a conditioned response to a stimulus if a reward was associated with the action and the stimulus.
7.52.1.1.3.2	A rat, for example, could be conditioned to press a lever in response to a stimulus if it got a reward when it pressed the lever.
7.52.1.1.3.3	Because the animal was conditioned to perform an operation on its environment, this experimental protocol was called operant conditioning and became another model of learning.
7.52.1.1.4.1	The experimental approaches to behavior initiated by Pavlov and Skinner stimulated a lot of research on animal behavior, but the focus of that research was mostly controlled laboratory experiments on learning and memory in only a few species   mostly the white rat.
7.52.1.1.4.2	This field of animal behavior became known as behaviorism.
7.52.1.2.1.1	An alternative approach to the study of animal behavior arose at the same time as behaviorism and focused on the various behaviors of animals in their natural environment.
7.52.1.2.1.2	This field of study became known as ethology (Greek ethos, &#8220;character,&#8221; + logos, &#8220;study&#8221;).
7.52.1.2.1.3	Ethologists were interested in a wide variety of species, their evolutionary relationships, and the ways in which their behaviors were adapted to their environments.
7.52.1.2.1.4	The leaders of the ethology movement were Karl von Frisch, who discovered the dance language of honey bees; Konrad Lorenz, who discovered that the strong bond between parent and offspring develops during a &#8220;critical period&#8221; following birth; and Niko Tinbergen, who studied inborn patterns of behavior commonly known as instincts.
7.52.1.2.1.5	These three scientists shared the Nobel Prize in 1973 for &#8220;their discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behavior patterns. &#8221; Their work laid the foundation for modern research on animal behavior.
7.52.1.2.2.1	Ethologists were mainly interested in species-specific or instinctive behaviors that therefore had to have genetic components.
7.52.1.2.2.2	Behaviors were thought to be genetically determined if they:
7.52.1.2.3.1	are performed without learning.
7.52.1.2.4.1	are stereotypic (that is, they are performed the same way each time).
7.52.1.2.5.1	cannot be modified by learning.
7.52.1.2.6.1	The ethologists called such behaviors fixed action patterns.
7.52.1.2.7.1	Ethologists performed deprivation experiments to demonstrate the genetic determination of a behavior.
7.52.1.2.7.2	They raised animals in an environment devoid of opportunities to learn their species-specific behavior, and then looked for the expression of that behavior.
7.52.1.2.7.3	The web spinning of a spider is an example of a natural deprivation experiment.
7.52.1.2.7.4	The parents of a young spider die before it hatches, and in a seasonal environment it has no model webs to copy when it spins its first web, which requires thousands of stereotyped sequential movements.
7.52.1.2.7.5	Yet a young spider creates a perfect, species-specific web the first and every time it spins a web.
7.52.1.2.7.6	Thus the information for the web spinning behavior has to be genetically programmed into its nervous system.
7.52.1.2.8.1	Fixed action patterns are usually responses to specific stimuli.
7.52.1.2.8.2	The ethologists carefully characterized such stimuli, which they called releasers.
7.52.1.2.8.3	In general, releasers are simple subsets of the information available in the environment.
7.52.1.2.8.4	For example, Tinbergen studied the begging behavior of gull chicks.
7.52.1.2.8.5	Adult gulls have a red dot on their lower bill.
7.52.1.2.8.6	When a parent returns to the nest to feed its chicks, the chicks peck on the red dot, which stimulates the parent to regurgitate food (Figure 52.2A).
7.52.1.2.8.7	Experimenters investigated what stimulated the chicks to peck their parents&#8217; bills.
7.52.1.2.8.8	Models of gull heads of different shapes and colors were tested (Figure 52.2B), as were models of a beak without a head.
7.52.1.2.8.9	The results showed that the red dot was necessary for the release of chick pecking behavior.
7.52.1.2.8.10	In fact, a pencil with a red eraser elicited a more robust pecking response than an accurate model of a gull head without a red dot.
7.52.1.2.8.11	Figure 52.2 Releasing a Fixed Action Pattern
7.52.1.3.1.1	The ethologists demonstrated the genetic basis for fixed action patterns by interbreeding closely related species.
7.52.1.3.1.2	Konrad Lorenz studied the courtship behaviors of different species of dabbling ducks.
7.52.1.3.1.3	Some of these species, such as mallards, teals, pintails, and gadwalls, are closely related and can interbreed, but they rarely do so in nature.
7.52.1.3.1.4	Each male duck performs a courtship display consisting of a precise series of movements that is typical of his species.
7.52.1.3.1.5	A female is not likely to accept him unless the entire display is successfully and correctly completed.
7.52.1.3.2.1	Lorenz crossbred these duck species and found that the hybrid offspring expressed some elements of each parent&#8217;s courtship display, but in novel combinations.
7.52.1.3.2.2	Furthermore, Lorenz observed that hybrids sometimes exhibited display elements that were not in the repertoire of either parent species but were seen in other dabbling duck species.
7.52.1.3.2.3	Lorenz&#8217;s interbreeding studies demonstrated that the stereotypic motor patterns of the courtship displays are inherited.
7.52.1.3.2.4	The observation that females were not interested in males performing hybrid displays was evidence that sexual selection had shaped these genetically determined behaviors to be *reproductive isolating mechanisms.
7.52.1.3.3.1	*connect the concepts The evolution of populations into different species occurs when hybrids of the two populations have lower fitness.
7.52.1.3.3.2	In those cases, selection favors mechanisms that prevent hybridization, and behavioral reproductive isolating mechanisms are the most common, as described in Key Concept 23.4.
7.52.1.3.4.1	The ethologists laid the foundation for the application of modern biological methods to the study of animal behavior.
7.52.1.3.4.2	Tinbergen outlined the challenges for investigators as four questions:
7.52.1.3.5.1	Causation: What is the mechanism underlying the behavior, and how can the relationship between mechanisms and behavior be modified by learning?
7.52.1.3.6.1	Development: What experiences are necessary for a behavior to be displayed, and how does the behavior change with age?
7.52.1.3.7.1	Function: How does the behavior affect the animal&#8217;s chances for survival and reproduction?
7.52.1.3.8.1	Evolution: How does the behavior compare with similar behaviors in related species, and how might it have evolved?
7.52.1.3.9.1	The first two questions refer to the proximate causes of behavior: the immediate genetic, physiological, neurological, and developmental mechanisms that determine how an individual is behaving at a particular time.
7.52.1.3.9.2	The third and fourth questions refer to the ultimate causes of behavior: the evolutionary processes that produced the animal&#8217;s capacity and tendency to behave in particular ways.
7.52.1.3.9.3	In the sections that follow, we will describe many experiments on animal behavior.
7.52.1.3.9.4	For each one, ask yourself which of Tinbergen&#8217;s four questions it addresses and whether it focuses on proximate or ultimate causes of behavior.
7.52.1.3.10.1	52.1 recap
7.52.1.3.11.1	Early scientific studies of animal behavior took two approaches.
7.52.1.3.11.2	Behaviorists focused on the study of conditioned behavior in a few species of laboratory animals and asked questions about learning.
7.52.1.3.11.3	Ethologists studied genetically determined behavior in many species in their natural environments and asked evolutionary questions.
7.52.1.3.12.1	learning outcomes
7.52.1.3.13.1	You should be able to:
7.52.1.3.14.1	Differentiate between behaviorism and ethology.
7.52.1.3.15.1	Explain the significance of deprivation experiments.
7.52.1.3.16.1	Explain what proximate and ultimate causes of behavior are, using examples.
7.52.1.3.17.1	What distinguishes fixed action patterns from behaviors resulting from Pavlovian or operant conditioning?
7.52.1.3.18.1	What variables might account for a genetically determined behavior not being expressed in a deprivation experiment?
7.52.1.3.19.1	What are proximate and ultimate causes of mating-display behavior?
7.52.1.3.20.1	The work of the ethologists left no doubt that behavior can be genetically determined, but how?
7.52.1.3.20.2	Genes code for proteins, whereas behaviors are highly complex traits involving sensory input and intricate patterns of control over responses to that input.
7.52.1.3.20.3	Is it reasonable to think that a single gene can have a specific effect on a behavior?
7.52.1.3.21.1	Chapter 52 continues with
7.52.1.3.22.1	52.2 Behavior Can Be Genetically Determined
7.52.2.1.1	Single gene mutations can alter behavioral phenotypes
7.52.2.2.1	Knockout experiments reveal the roles of specific genes
7.52.2.3.1	Gene cascades can control complex behavioral phenotypes
7.52.2.4.1	The work of the ethologists showed the strong genetic basis for most animal behaviors.
7.52.2.4.2	Of course, most animals are insects and other invertebrates, and even among the vertebrates most are not mammals, let alone primates.
7.52.2.4.3	So even though the controversy over the relative influences of nature versus nurture in human behavior has raged for many years, the dominant role played by genes in shaping behavior is amply documented by research on other species.
7.52.2.4.4	Genetically determined complex behaviors such as the web spinning of spiders or the mating behaviors of dabbling ducks mentioned above must surely depend on many genes.
7.52.2.4.5	Yet with the rapid development of genomic analytical technologies, comparisons of genomes of animals with different behavioral phenotypes are producing many examples of single gene alterations that produce behavioral differences.
7.52.2.5.1	focus your learning
7.52.2.6.1	Even single genes can influence complex behaviors.
7.52.2.7.1	Breeding and gene knockout experiments reveal genetic determinants of behavior.
7.52.2.1.1.1	Are you a morning person or a night person?
7.52.2.1.1.2	Some people are early risers and function best in the morning, and others have their best work hours late at night.
7.52.2.1.1.3	It is possible that this big difference in the behavior of individuals could be due to differences in a single gene.
7.52.2.1.1.4	This story begins with fruit flies, Drosophila.
7.52.2.1.1.5	Fruit flies, like virtually all organisms, have daily rhythms that continue even if all external time cues are taken away.
7.52.2.1.1.6	But without external time cues, these rhythms do not span exactly 24 hours, which is why they are called circadian (circa, &#8220;about,&#8221; + dies, &#8220; a day&#8221;).
7.52.2.1.1.7	Investigators using chemicals to randomly mutate genes in Drosophila found one gene that controlled the duration, or period, of the circadian rhythms of the flies.
7.52.2.1.1.8	This gene was named per for period, and variants of this gene caused short or long circadian periods.
7.52.2.1.1.9	We now know that there are many more genes involved in circadian rhythms, and that these genes are highly conserved in organisms ranging from Drosophila to humans.
7.52.2.1.1.10	One variant of the per gene in humans results in familial advanced phase sleep syndrome.
7.52.2.1.1.11	The affected individuals have short circadian rhythms and tend to go to sleep and wake up earlier than others.
7.52.2.1.2.1	That single genes can influence even complex behaviors should not be surprising.
7.52.2.1.2.2	Many behaviors depend on a particular signaling molecule or a particular receptor molecule, and a change in the gene for that signal or receptor could therefore dramatically change the behavior.
7.52.2.1.2.3	For example, mutation in a gene for an olfactory receptor could result in the ability to sense a different odorant.
7.52.2.1.2.4	Even changes in the expression pattern of a gene can alter a complex behavior.
7.52.2.1.2.5	As we discussed at the beginning of Chapter 7, prairie voles are highly monogamous, and both sexes give much parental care to their young.
7.52.2.1.2.6	Montane voles do not form pair bonds, are promiscuous, and provide a shorter period of maternal care than prairie voles.
7.52.2.1.2.7	The difference between these two species lies in the expression of the receptors for the neuropeptides vasopressin (males) and oxytocin (females): there are far fewer receptors for these neuropeptides in the brains of montane voles.
7.52.2.1.2.8	We&#8217;ll return to the social systems of voles in Key Concept 52.6.
7.52.2.2.1.1	As you may recall from Chapter 18, a knockout experiment is a&#160;genetic&#160;technique in which one of an&#160;organism&#8217;s&#160;genes&#160;is made inoperable (&#8220;knocked out&#8221;) to see what effect its elimination has on the organism&#8217;s phenotype.
7.52.2.2.1.2	Knocking out genes involved in sensory pathways can have pronounced effects on behavior.
7.52.2.2.1.3	One example is a gene for a specific olfactory receptor in mice.
7.52.2.2.2.1	As was discussed in Key Concept 45.2, mice have two olfactory organs: the nasal olfactory epithelium common to all mammals, and a small organ in the nasal passages called the vomeronasal organ, or VNO (Figure 52.3).
7.52.2.2.2.2	Catherine Dulac at Harvard University discovered that pheromone receptors were expressed in that organ.
7.52.2.2.2.3	(Pheromones are signaling molecules that are released into the environment and are used for communication between individuals of the same species. )
7.52.2.2.2.4	Dulac hypothesized that when sex pheromones produced by female mice bind to the receptors in the male&#8217;s VNO, they stimulate mating behavior.
7.52.2.2.2.5	To test this hypothesis, Dulac created a genetically engineered male mouse in which a gene for VNO receptor signaling was knocked out.
7.52.2.2.2.6	Contrary to the hypothesis, the knockout males in fact did pursue and mate with females placed in their cages.
7.52.2.2.2.7	However, they also pursued and tried to mate with males placed in their cages.
7.52.2.2.2.8	Normally a male mouse reacts aggressively to a strange male, but the knockout male could not discriminate between males and females placed in his cage.
7.52.2.2.2.9	Thus properly functioning VNO receptors appear to be essential not for sexual attraction, but for sex identification.
7.52.2.2.2.10	You can imagine how selection working on this one gene could modify the intensity of male   male aggression and lead to changes in social behavior.
7.52.2.2.3.1	Figure 52.3 The Mouse Vomeronasal Organ Identifies Sex
7.52.2.3.1.1	Male courtship behavior in the fruit fly (Drosophila) is stereotypic, species-specific, and requires no learning   a classic fixed action pattern.
7.52.2.3.1.2	When a male encounters a potential mate, he follows her, taps her body with his foreleg, extends and vibrates one wing, and licks her genitals (Figure 52.4A).
7.52.2.3.1.3	The development of this complex male behavior is under the control of a single gene, called fruitless (fru), and the development of male anatomy is under the control of another gene, called doublesex (dsx).
7.52.2.3.1.4	In both males and females, these two genes are part of gene expression cascades that differ in the splicing of the mRNA in the two sexes.
7.52.2.3.1.5	Those splicing differences result in different dsx and fru gene products in males and females (Figure 52.4B).
7.52.2.3.1.6	The female version of the Dsx protein controls the development of female anatomy, and the expression of fru in the male nervous system results in the organization of the neural circuitry controlling male sexual behavior.
7.52.2.3.2.1	Figure 52.4 The fruitless Gene
7.52.2.3.3.1	There are two take-home lessons from this example.
7.52.2.3.3.2	First, genes that control aspects of behavior, like other genes, are generally embedded in gene cascades that offer opportunities for simple genetic changes to alter the phenotype of even complex behaviors.
7.52.2.3.3.3	Second, certain genes, such as dsx and fru, influence a range of other genes that contribute to complex behaviors.
7.52.2.3.3.4	Modifications in any one of those genes or its expression can alter behavior.
7.52.2.3.3.5	Thus even though no behavior is coded for by a single gene, alterations in single genes can influence behavior in ways that affect an animal&#8217;s fitness.
7.52.2.3.4.1	52.2 recap
7.52.2.3.5.1	There are strong genetic determinants of behavior in most species.
7.52.2.3.5.2	Gene manipulations such as mutations and knockouts show that a single gene can play a large role in the development and expression of a behavior.
7.52.2.3.5.3	Although most behaviors are controlled by multiple genes, those genes frequently function in signaling cascades, so a single gene modification can influence even a complex behavior controlled by many genes.
7.52.2.3.6.1	learning outcomes
7.52.2.3.7.1	You should be able to:
7.52.2.3.8.1	Give examples of a single gene influencing a behavior.
7.52.2.3.9.1	Describe different kinds of evidence supporting the claim that single genes can influence behavior.
7.52.2.3.10.1	Explain the evolutionary benefit of a gene expression cascade that influences behavior.
7.52.2.3.11.1	A method has recently been developed to increase the expression of oxytocin and vasopressin genes in montane voles.
7.52.2.3.11.2	What difference might that treatment make in the behavior of these animals?
7.52.2.3.11.3	If the expected result is not seen, what could be the reason?
7.52.2.3.12.1	If you interbred two individuals from separate populations that bred true for a trait that differed between the two, and all of the offspring resembled one of the parents, what would you conclude about the genetic basis for that behavior?
7.52.2.3.13.1	What could be an evolutionary reason for a species-specific mating behavior being controlled by a gene expression cascade, such as in Drosophila?
7.52.2.3.14.1	How can the genetic cascades that underlie complex behaviors be programmed to respond selectively to specific sets of stimuli?
7.52.2.3.14.2	How can their expression be limited to appropriate times in an animal&#8217;s life?
7.52.2.3.14.3	The answers to these questions can be found by studying how behaviors develop over the life span.
7.52.2.3.15.1	Chapter 52 continues with
7.52.2.3.16.1	52.3 Behavior Can Be Studied Developmentally
7.52.3.1.1	Hormones can determine behavioral potential and timing
7.52.3.2.1	Some behaviors can be acquired only at certain times
7.52.3.3.1	Birdsong learning involves genetics, imprinting, development, and social interactions
7.52.3.4.1	The timing and expression of birdsong are under hormonal control
7.52.3.5.1	The emergence of behavior as an animal develops and matures depends on the development of the nervous system as well as on the growth and maturation of other body systems.
7.52.3.5.2	But even with anatomical and physiological competence, specific behaviors may not be expressed.
7.52.3.5.3	Behaviors that are adaptive at one stage in an animal&#8217;s life may not be adaptive at other stages.
7.52.3.5.4	Behaviors typical of juvenile animals, such as begging for food, may disappear and new behavior patterns of a mature individual, such as courtship displays, appear.
7.52.3.6.1	focus your learning
7.52.3.7.1	Hormones influence the development of certain behaviors and their expression at a later time.
7.52.3.8.1	Complex behaviors can involve both genetic determinants and learning.
7.52.3.1.1.1	Hormones can determine the development of a behavioral potential at an early age and the expression of that behavior at a later age.
7.52.3.1.1.2	An excellent example of this is sexual behavior in rats (Figure 52.5).
7.52.3.1.1.3	Normally, adult male and female rats exhibit different patterns of sexual behavior: females adopt a sexually receptive posture, called lordosis, in the presence of males, and males copulate with receptive females.
7.52.3.1.1.4	Neither sex, however, expresses these behaviors until the animals have reached adulthood.
7.52.3.1.1.5	Experiments in which newborn and adult rats were neutered (to remove the influence of sex steroids naturally produced by their gonads) and artificially treated with hormones led to the following conclusions:
7.52.3.1.2.1	Figure 52.5 Hormonal Control of Sexual Behavior
7.52.3.1.3.1	Development of male sexual behavior requires the brain of the newborn rat be exposed to testosterone.
7.52.3.1.3.2	Female sexual behavior development does not require exposure to estrogen.
7.52.3.1.4.1	Testosterone masculinizes the nervous systems of both genetic males and genetic females.
7.52.3.1.5.1	Exposure to sex steroids in adulthood is necessary for the expression of sexual behavior, but testosterone produces male sexual behavior only in adult rats whose brains were masculinized when they were newborns, and estrogen produces female sexual behavior only in adult rats whose brains were not masculinized when they were newborns.
7.52.3.1.6.1	Thus the sex steroids that are present at birth determine which pattern of behavior develops, and the sex steroids that are present in adulthood determine when that pattern is expressed.
7.52.3.2.1.1	Responsiveness to simple releasers is sufficient for certain behaviors such as begging behavior in gull chicks, but more complex information that cannot be genetically programmed is required for other behaviors.
7.52.3.2.1.2	An example is parent   offspring recognition.
7.52.3.2.1.3	When animals live in close proximity to other individuals, as in a herd or a nesting colony, it is important for parent and offspring to learn each other&#8217;s identity soon after birth so they will be able to find each other in a crowded situation.
7.52.3.2.1.4	In many such cases, a parent   offspring bond is formed by imprinting.
7.52.3.2.1.5	What characterizes imprinting is that an animal learns a specific set of stimuli during a limited time called a critical period, also known as a sensitive period.
7.52.3.2.2.1	Konrad Lorenz demonstrated that young greylag geese (Anser anser) imprint on their parents between 12 and 16 hours after hatching.
7.52.3.2.2.2	By positioning himself to be present during this critical period, Lorenz succeeded in imprinting goslings on himself.
7.52.3.2.2.3	The imprinted goslings followed him around as if he were their parent (Figure 52.6A).
7.52.3.2.2.4	In a subsequent experiment his assistants wore boots with different patterns on them.
7.52.3.2.2.5	The goslings imprinted on the boots, and even in a situation that mixed different groups of goslings, they always sorted themselves out by following their &#8220;parental&#8221; boots.
7.52.3.2.2.6	Figure 52.6 Imprinting Helps Parents and Offspring Recognize Each Other
7.52.3.2.3.1	Imprinting requires only a brief exposure, but its effects are strong and long-lasting.
7.52.3.2.3.2	Emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri) reproduce during the coldest, darkest time of year in Antarctica.
7.52.3.2.3.3	The parents walk up to 150 kilometers inland to form a dense colony, where the female lays her egg.
7.52.3.2.3.4	She then walks back to the ocean to feed while her mate incubates the egg.
7.52.3.2.3.5	By the time she returns, the chick has hatched.
7.52.3.2.3.6	She then takes over its care and feeding, and the father walks back to the ocean to feed.
7.52.3.2.3.7	Generally he is away so long that the mother must leave to find food to avoid starvation.
7.52.3.2.3.8	Thus after being away for weeks, the father must find his chick in a crowded, milling colony of chicks, all calling for their parents (Figure 52.6B).
7.52.3.2.3.9	Yet he can unerringly locate his own offspring by recognizing its call, which he imprinted on before he left to feed.
7.52.3.2.4.1	The critical or sensitive period for imprinting may be determined by a brief hormonal state.
7.52.3.2.4.2	For example, if a mother goat does not nuzzle and lick her newborn within 10 minutes after its birth, she will not recognize it as her own offspring later.
7.52.3.2.4.3	For goats, the sensitive period is associated with peaking levels of the hormone oxytocin in the mother&#8217;s circulatory system at the time she gives birth and at the same time she is sensing the olfactory cues emanating from her newborn kid.
7.52.3.2.4.4	A female goat rendered incapable of smelling before giving birth is unable to differentiate between her own kid and other kids after giving birth.
7.52.3.3.1.1	The study of white-crowned sparrow singing at the beginning of this chapter is a classic case of how genetics, physiology, and experience come together in the development and expression of behavior.
7.52.3.3.1.2	Genetics endows the birds with a neural template that must be matched by experience during early development.
7.52.3.3.1.3	That type of learning   imprinting   is limited to a sensitive or critical period by processes of developmental physiology.
7.52.3.3.1.4	Months later, the onset of sexual maturation motivates the birds to sing, initiating a second phase of learning that requires the birds to use auditory experience to develop the motor patterns required for the full expression of species-specific song (Figure 52.7).
7.52.3.3.1.5	At the end of this learning phase, the song becomes permanent, or crystalized.
7.52.3.3.1.6	Thus the overall process of transmission of a complex species-specific behavior necessary for reproductive success is well adapted to preserving constancy of the behavior.
7.52.3.3.1.7	But variation is an important component of evolution.
7.52.3.3.1.8	Figure 52.7 Sensitive Periods for Song Learning
7.52.3.3.2.1	Variation in birdsong is evident in nature.
7.52.3.3.2.2	There are subtle differences between the songs of any two males, including those in neighboring territories.
7.52.3.3.2.3	Regionally, white-crowned sparrows have dialects, and a bird migrating into an area that has a different dialect can adopt that song pattern.
7.52.3.3.2.4	There are even observations of white-crowned sparrows singing the songs of closely related species.
7.52.3.3.2.5	In an interesting laboratory experiment, white-crowned sparrows were raised in isolation but exposed to the sight and song of a male of a closely related species while recordings of white-crowned sparrow song played on speakers.
7.52.3.3.2.6	When those birds matured, they sang the song of the closely related species.
7.52.3.3.2.7	The ability to incorporate variation into an individual bird&#8217;s song may relate to social interactions such as fitting into a regional norm, displaying individual qualities to a potential mate, and maintaining a bond between mates.
7.52.3.3.3.1	To investigate questions about the adaptive significance of variations in the male singing behavior, it is necessary to take female choice into consideration.
7.52.3.3.3.2	Sarah Woolley and Allison Doupe at the University of California, San Francisco did that with zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), a species that has become a valuable model system for studying the neurobiology of birdsong.
7.52.3.3.3.3	When male zebra finches sing in isolation, their song is variable (&#8220;undirected&#8221;), almost as if they are improvising and trying out new motifs.
7.52.3.3.3.4	In the presence of females, however, they sing &#8220;directed&#8221; song (directed to a female) that is less variable.
7.52.3.3.3.5	Woolley and Doupe conducted experiments to see which songs female zebra finches preferred (Investigating Life: Practice Makes Perfect).
7.52.3.3.3.6	The females preferred directed song, and if mated, they preferred the directed song of their mate.
7.52.3.3.3.7	Thus the ability to incorporate variations into the species-specific song may be important to establish individuality and influence mate choice, but the nature of the singing depends on the social context.

7.52.3.3.12.2	Play recordings of her mate&#8217;s directed song in one end-chamber and of her mate&#8217;s undirected song in the other end-chamber.
7.52.3.3.13.1	Record the amount of time the female spends in the different chambers.
7.52.3.3.14.1	RESULTS
7.52.3.3.15.1	Females spent a higher percentage of time in the chamber in which their mate&#8217;s directed song was played.
7.52.3.3.15.2	The data show results for 17 females with means and standard deviations.
7.52.3.3.15.3	The P-value from a paired t-test is &lt;0.001.
7.52.3.3.16.1	CONCLUSION Females can discriminate between their mate&#8217;s directed and undirected songs and are more attracted to the directed song.
7.52.3.3.17.1	work with the data
7.52.3.3.18.1	Since the experiment showed that females could distinguish between the directed and undirected songs of their mates, the next question was whether they could distinguish between the directed song of their mates and the directed song of other males.
7.52.3.3.18.2	A second experiment used the same protocol as did the first one, but the two songs that were played to each female were the directed song of her mate and the directed song of an unfamiliar male.
7.52.3.3.18.3	The results are shown in the table.

7.52.3.3.19.1	QUESTIONS
7.52.3.3.20.1	If you hypothesized that the female&#8217;s preference for her mate&#8217;s directed song was a factor in pair bonding rather than just a mating stimulus, what data might you collect to test this hypothesis?
7.52.3.3.21.1	Plot the data as bar graphs.
7.52.3.3.21.2	Show the means and standard deviations, and do a paired t-test to determine the significance level.
7.52.3.3.21.3	Can females distinguish their mate&#8217;s directed song from the directed song of an unfamiliar male?
7.52.3.3.22.1	What do these results suggest about the mating system of the zebra finch?
7.52.3.3.23.1	What hypotheses can you suggest about the function of undirected song?
7.52.3.3.24.1	A similar work with the data exercise may be assigned in LaunchPad.
7.52.3.4.1.1	Both male and female songbirds hear their species-specific song as nestlings, but only the males of many species sing as adults, and most do so only in spring.
7.52.3.4.1.2	Hormones underlie both the difference in song expression between male and female songbirds and the timing of song expression.
7.52.3.4.1.3	When investigators injected adult female songbirds with testosterone in spring, those females sang their species-specific song just as males did.
7.52.3.4.1.4	Females as well as males form a memory of their species-specific song when they are nestlings, and they have the physical capacity to sing, but under normal circumstances they lack the necessary hormonal stimulation.
7.52.3.4.2.1	How does testosterone cause a songbird to sing?
7.52.3.4.2.2	Each spring an increase in circulating testosterone levels causes certain parts of the male&#8217;s brain necessary for learning and developing song to grow larger.
7.52.3.4.2.3	Individual neurons in those regions of the brain increase in size and grow longer extensions, and the number of neurons in those regions increases.
7.52.3.4.2.4	Thus hormones can control behavior by changing brain structure as well as brain function, both developmentally and in response to environmental cues.
7.52.3.4.3.1	52.3 recap
7.52.3.4.4.1	Genetics can determine what behaviors can be learned, and hormones can determine the sensitive period when they can be learned as well as the motivational states that trigger their expression.
7.52.3.4.4.2	Imprinting ensures the ability of individuals to recognize other individuals or species at a later time.
7.52.3.4.4.3	Some capacity for variation of genetically determined and imprinted behaviors enables behavior to be shaped by social context.
7.52.3.4.5.1	learning outcomes
7.52.3.4.6.1	You should be able to:
7.52.3.4.7.1	Explain how hormones can affect the timing and expression of behavior.
7.52.3.4.8.1	Describe the evidence supporting the claim that genetics are important in bird singing behavior.
7.52.3.4.9.1	Explain the evolutionary benefit of variability in the singing behavior of a bird species.
7.52.3.4.10.1	Why is female considered to be the default pathway for the development of sexual behavior in rats?
7.52.3.4.11.1	Explain why a songbird deafened in adulthood can sing its song, but a songbird deafened before reaching sexual maturity cannot.
7.52.3.4.12.1	Under what conditions might variability in a species-specific behavior be adaptive or not be adaptive?
7.52.3.4.13.1	Complex behaviors are the product of interactions of genetic, physiological, and environmental factors.
7.52.3.4.13.2	Many genes are involved in shaping behavior, and therefore there are multiple opportunities for selection to favor behavioral modifications.
7.52.3.4.13.3	Questions about how changes in behavior adapt animals to environmental conditions are the province of an evolution-based field called behavioral ecology.
7.52.3.4.14.1	Chapter 52 continues with
7.52.3.4.15.1	52.4 Selective Pressures Shape Behavior
7.52.4.1.1	Animals are faced with many choices
7.52.4.2.1	Behaviors have costs and benefits
7.52.4.3.1	Territorial behavior carries significant costs
7.52.4.4.1	Foraging behavior has costs and benefits
7.52.4.5.1	Most of the behaviors we have discussed so far involve interactions between individuals.
7.52.4.5.2	The individual also interacts with its environment, and many behaviors have evolved as adaptations to the environment.
7.52.4.5.3	Environmental conditions can be highly variable over time and space.
7.52.4.5.4	Behavioral ecologists strive to discover the relationships between behavior and environment, with the intent of understanding the selective pressures shaping the evolution of specific behaviors.
7.52.4.5.5	Here we offer just a few examples.
7.52.4.6.1	focus your learning
7.52.4.7.1	The evolution of behavioral responses to the environment is driven by costs and benefits.
7.52.4.8.1	Different types of territoriality have different costs and benefits.
7.52.4.9.1	The evolution of foraging behavior is driven by costs and benefits.
7.52.4.1.1.1	Animal behavior is largely a sequence of choices: where and when to move, where to build a nest, what to eat, when to fight and when to flee, with whom to associate, with whom to mate.
7.52.4.1.1.2	Making wrong choices reduces fitness.
7.52.4.1.1.3	Behavioral ecologists seek to discover what information animals use to make behavioral choices and how that information relates to the environmental conditions that influence fitness.
7.52.4.1.2.1	Where an animal lives is referred to as its habitat.
7.52.4.1.2.2	In most cases the habitat provides not only a protected nest site, but also food and access to mates.
7.52.4.1.2.3	The environmental cues animals use to select their habitat may be quite simple.
7.52.4.1.2.4	For example, seabirds select cliffs or offshore rocks for nesting, and both of those sites offer protection from predators.
7.52.4.1.2.5	Animals with very specialized food requirements select habitats where those foods are abundant.
7.52.4.1.2.6	The general hypothesis that guides behavioral ecologists is that the cues animals use to select habitats are reliable predictors of conditions suitable for future survival and reproduction.
7.52.4.1.3.1	For many species, the presence of conspecifics   other members of the same species   can be a valuable cue.
7.52.4.1.3.2	Observing conspecifics can provide animals with information about the quality of a habitat.
7.52.4.1.3.3	After all, you can&#8217;t argue with success.
7.52.4.1.3.4	During the breeding season, European collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) are nosy neighbors, regularly visiting the nests of conspecifics.
7.52.4.1.3.5	Researchers hypothesized that this behavior allows the flycatchers to assess the quality of the habitat by seeing how well their neighbors are faring.
7.52.4.1.3.6	To test this hypothesis, they created some areas with supersized broods   normally an indication of abundant food   by taking young birds from some nests and adding them to nests in another area.
7.52.4.1.3.7	The next year, flycatchers preferentially settled in the areas where broods had been artificially enlarged.
7.52.4.2.1.1	A cost   benefit approach can be used to investigate the relationships between behavior, environment, and fitness.
7.52.4.2.1.2	A cost   benefit approach assumes that an animal has only a limited amount of time and energy, and therefore cannot afford to engage in behaviors that cost more to perform than they return in benefits.
7.52.4.2.1.3	A cost   benefit approach provides a framework that can be used to construct hypotheses and design experiments to investigate why behavior patterns evolve as they do.
7.52.4.2.2.1	The benefits of a behavior are measured in terms of the enhancement in fitness an animal accrues by performing the behavior.
7.52.4.2.2.2	The cost of a behavior typically has three components:
7.52.4.2.3.1	Energetic cost is the energy the animal expends performing the behavior.
7.52.4.2.4.1	Risk cost is the increased chance of being injured or killed.
7.52.4.2.5.1	Opportunity cost is the benefit the animal forgoes by not being able to perform other behaviors at the same time.
7.52.4.3.1.1	Territorial behavior is a good subject for cost   benefit analysis.
7.52.4.3.1.2	Territoriality is aggressive behavior that actively denies other animals access to a habitat or resource.
7.52.4.3.1.3	Optimal habitats and resources may be in short supply, so conspecifics have to compete for them.
7.52.4.3.1.4	Many animals   usually males   defend all-purpose territories that provide a nest site, food, and access to mates.
7.52.4.3.1.5	The territory holder stakes out his boundaries by engaging in aggressive interactions with neighbors, and must then patrol those boundaries constantly and respond to trespassers.
7.52.4.3.1.6	These aggressive interactions usually consist of highly stereotypic, species-specific displays such as birdsong.
7.52.4.3.1.7	Through territorial behavior, the male obtains the resources he needs for reproductive success, but he also pays a price.
7.52.4.3.2.1	Territorial displays require considerable expenditure of energy, they make a male more vulnerable to predation, and they detract from the time he has for feeding or engaging in parental behavior.
7.52.4.3.2.2	Michael Moore and Catherine Marler at Arizona State University performed an experiment to estimate the costs incurred by male Yarrow&#8217;s spiny lizards (Sceloporus jarrovii) when defending a territory.
7.52.4.3.2.3	These lizards defend territories that include the home ranges of several females.
7.52.4.3.2.4	Their territorial behavior is normally most intense during September and October when circulating testosterone levels of the males are high and the females are most receptive to mating.
7.52.4.3.2.5	The researchers varied the intensity of the lizards&#8217; territorial behavior by implanting testosterone capsules in some males in summer, when they are not normally highly territorial (Figure 52.8).

7.52.4.3.6.1	By using testosterone implants to increase territorial behavior, Michael Moore and Catherine Marler measured the costs to male Yarrow&#8217;s spiny lizards (Sceloporus jarrovii) of defending a territory during the summer, when they do not normally do so.
7.52.4.3.7.1	HYPOTHESIS Yarrow&#8217;s spiny lizards do not defend a territory during summer because the energetic costs of territorial behavior in that season outweigh the benefits.
7.52.4.3.8.1	METHOD
7.52.4.3.9.1	1.
7.52.4.3.9.2	During the summer, when female lizards are not sexually receptive, insert testosterone capsules under the skin of some males; other males received empty capsules to serve as controls.
7.52.4.3.10.1	2.
7.52.4.3.10.2	Observe the patterns of territorial behavior and the survival rate of the two groups of males.
7.52.4.3.11.1	RESULTS
7.52.4.3.12.1	CONCLUSION For these lizards, the cost of defending territories during summer significantly reduces their survival rate.
7.52.4.3.13.1	Testosterone-treated males spent more time patrolling their territories, performed more displays, and expended about one-third more energy than control males (energetic cost).
7.52.4.3.13.2	They had less time to feed (opportunity cost), captured fewer insects, stored less energy, and had a higher death rate (risk costs).
7.52.4.3.13.3	In summer, when females are not normally receptive, these high costs of vigorous territorial defense outweigh the reproductive benefits of territoriality.
7.52.4.3.13.4	Thus natural selection has favored seasonal variation in the level of the hormone controlling territorial behavior in this species.
7.52.4.3.14.1	The cost   benefit approach explains the diversity of territorial behaviors seen in different species.
7.52.4.3.14.2	Even if a resource is essential to an animal, if it cannot be defended economically, the animal will not engage in territorial behavior.
7.52.4.3.14.3	Food is essential for all animals, but if the food is widely distributed in space or fluctuating in availability, there is no benefit to balance the high costs of trying to defend it.
7.52.4.3.14.4	For example, the open ocean where seabirds feed cannot be defended.
7.52.4.3.14.5	But safe nest sites on islands or rocky cliffs are in short supply, and they can be defended.
7.52.4.3.14.6	The territories of seabirds may be no larger than the distance the birds can reach while sitting on their nests (Figure 52.9A).
7.52.4.3.14.7	Figure 52.9 Animals Defend Territories of Different Sizes
7.52.4.3.15.1	In some cases the resource that is defended is the female herself.
7.52.4.3.15.2	Elephant seals spend most of their lives at sea, but females come to land at traditional beach sites to give birth to their pups.
7.52.4.3.15.3	Male elephant seals arrive at these sites ahead of time and stake out territories through vigorous fighting (Figure 52.9B).
7.52.4.3.15.4	When the females arrive on the beaches, they have to enter the territories of the males.
7.52.4.3.15.5	As long as the male territory holder can fend off challengers, he will be able to mate with all the females using his piece of the beach.
7.52.4.3.16.1	One unusual form of male territorial behavior arises in situations in which neither food, nest sites, nor females are defended.
7.52.4.3.16.2	A lek is an area where males gather for the purpose of engaging in intense displays of their territorial prowess aimed at impressing females and winning the opportunity to mate.
7.52.4.3.16.3	Even though space is not limited, each male defends a small piece of real estate on which he performs a display (Figure 52.9C).
7.52.4.3.16.4	Those territories closest to the center of the lek are the prime sites, and males compete intensely for those locations.
7.52.4.3.16.5	The females visit the lek, observe the males, and generally mate with the males holding the prime sites.
7.52.4.3.16.6	The benefit of this system to the female is that she is inseminated by a successful competitor, and therefore her offspring will carry the genes that contributed to his success.
7.52.4.3.16.7	This is another example of sexual selection (see Key Concept 20.2).
7.52.4.3.16.8	The costs of lekking to males are high, as they engage in continuous, intense territorial behavior that precludes eating, drinking, and sleeping until they are displaced.
7.52.4.3.16.9	The benefit is the chance to maximize their fitness by mating with many females.
7.52.4.4.1.1	Searching for food (foraging) involves many decisions: how much time to spend in each location, what is edible, and which potential foods should be eaten and which should be ignored.
7.52.4.4.1.2	A cost   benefit approach to feeding behavior has resulted in an optimal foraging theory, which aims at identifying the fitness value of feeding choices.
7.52.4.4.1.3	The primary benefit of foraging is nutrition: energy, minerals, and vitamins (see Key Concept 50.1).
7.52.4.4.1.4	The costs of foraging are similar to those of other behaviors: energy expended, time lost from other activities that could enhance fitness, and the risk of increased exposure to predators.
7.52.4.4.2.1	Animals frequently make choices among food items that may differ not only in terms of energy content, but also abundance or ease of acquisition and processing.
7.52.4.4.2.2	Optimal foraging theory predicts that in such situations, animals will make choices that will maximize the rate at which they obtain energy.
7.52.4.4.2.3	The more rapidly a foraging animal satisfies its energetic requirements, the lower the opportunity costs and risk costs of foraging.
7.52.4.4.2.4	Figure 52.10 Herbivores Seek Out Unusual Sources of Minerals
7.52.4.4.3.1	The energy maximization hypothesis considers food items in terms of the energy they provide, but animals have nutrient requirements in addition to energy that can play a role in shaping their foraging behavior.
7.52.4.4.3.2	Essential minerals, for example, are in short supply in some animals&#8217; diets, and those animals may incur large energetic costs and risks to obtain them (Figure 52.10).
7.52.4.4.3.3	Some foods may also be sought for their medicinal value.
7.52.4.4.3.4	Chimpanzees, for example, have been observed eating the pith of the plant Vernonia amygdalina.
7.52.4.4.3.5	The pith contains small quantities of a secondary metabolite (vernonioside B1) that is toxic to chimps at high concentrations, but at low concentrations can kill their intestinal parasites.
7.52.4.4.3.6	Chimps that consume this plant material have fewer parasites.
7.52.4.4.4.1	52.4 recap
7.52.4.4.5.1	Many behaviors are shaped by environmental conditions that influence the decisions animals must make.
7.52.4.4.5.2	Decisions can result in benefits that increase reproductive fitness, but they also involve costs, including energetic costs, opportunity costs, and risk costs.
7.52.4.4.5.3	Cost   benefit analysis can be applied to territorial and foraging behaviors.

7.52.4.4.7.1	You should be able to:
7.52.4.4.8.1	Describe how a cost   benefit approach is applied to investigating animal behavior.
7.52.4.4.9.1	Describe different types of territorial behaviors and the cost and benefit factors that shape their evolution.
7.52.4.4.10.1	Explain why aggressive territorial behavior is associated with some essential resources, but not others.
7.52.4.4.11.1	Explain how foraging involves trade-offs between nutrients acquired and the costs of energy required, opportunity loss, and risk.
7.52.4.4.12.1	Male redwing blackbirds prefer to build nests in marshes, but they feed in upland meadows.
7.52.4.4.12.2	What costs and benefits most likely shaped these behaviors?
7.52.4.4.13.1	Cichlid fish have dominant males that have colorful markings and defend territories.
7.52.4.4.13.2	There are also nondominant males that are plain and do not defend territories but occasionally dash in when a female is spawning to try to fertilize some of her eggs.
7.52.4.4.13.3	What are the costs and benefits of these two male phenotypes?
7.52.4.4.14.1	Elephant seals defend a piece of beach as a mating territory, whereas prairie-chickens defend small pieces of grassland as a mating territory.
7.52.4.4.14.2	Male elephant seals are much larger than the females and viciously fight with one another over their territories.
7.52.4.4.14.3	Male prairie-chickens are not much larger than females; they have elaborate displays, and they don&#8217;t fight viciously with neighboring males.
7.52.4.4.14.4	What selective pressures have shaped the behaviors of these two different kinds of animals that defend mating territories?
7.52.4.4.15.1	Consider a species that has a choice of two potential sources of food.
7.52.4.4.15.2	One is calorie-rich, but is dispersed in a sparse environment.
7.52.4.4.15.3	The other is calorie-poor but occurs in dense patches in a protected environment.
7.52.4.4.15.4	Which types of selective pressures would likely shape the food preference of this species?
7.52.4.4.16.1	Behavioral ecologists are interested in understanding how the natural environment influences the fitness value of behavioral choices   the ultimate causes of those behaviors, in Tinbergen&#8217;s terms.
7.52.4.4.16.2	Other behavioral biologists focus on the physiological mechanisms that underlie the proximate causes of behavior.
7.52.4.4.17.1	Chapter 52 continues with
7.52.4.4.18.1	52.5 Behavior Can Be Studied Mechanistically
7.52.5.1.1	Biological rhythms coordinate behavior with environmental cycles
7.52.5.2.1	Animals must find their way around their environment
7.52.5.3.1	Animals use multiple modalities to communicate
7.52.5.4.1	Control of behavior involves the nervous and endocrine systems.
7.52.5.4.2	Execution of behavior involves the musculoskeletal system as well as other effector mechanisms, such as those that produce secretions, color changes, electrical impulses, sound, and even light.
7.52.5.4.3	We have already considered many of the physiological systems that are involved in these processes, including hormones, reproductive systems, nervous systems, sensory systems, and feeding mechanisms.
7.52.5.4.4	The field of behavioral physiology, which encompasses aspects of all of these systems, is enormous, so here we will dig deeper into just three different phenomena studied by behavioral physiologists: the timing of behavior, navigation, and communication.
7.52.5.5.1	focus your learning
7.52.5.6.1	Animals have genetically determined daily and annual rhythms that enable them to anticipate future conditions.
7.52.5.7.1	Animals can navigate using landmarks or time and direction information, and some use true bicoordinate navigation.
7.52.5.8.1	Animals communicate using light, sound, mechanical, and chemical signals.
7.52.5.1.1.1	Earth turns on its axis once every 24 hours, generating daily cycles of light and dark, temperature, humidity, and tides.
7.52.5.1.1.2	In addition, Earth is tilted on its axis, so the light   dark cycle changes as Earth revolves around the sun.
7.52.5.1.1.3	These daily and seasonal cycles profoundly influence the physiology and behavior of animals.
7.52.5.1.1.4	Animals tend to be active either during the day (diurnal) or at night (nocturnal) and have sensory capabilities appropriate to this distinction.
7.52.5.1.1.5	Therefore it is adaptive to organize behavior on a cycle that corresponds with the environmental cycle of light and dark.
7.52.5.1.1.6	Similarly, a behavior that is adaptive at one time of year (such as midsummer) may not be adaptive at another time (midwinter).
7.52.5.1.1.7	Thus it is important for animals to organize their behavior with respect to time of the day or year and to be able to anticipate those times.
7.52.5.1.1.1.1	Experimental animals kept under constant conditions with no daily time cues such as light and dark, temperature cycles, or episodic availability of food and water still have daily cycles of activities such as locomotor activity, sleeping, eating, drinking, learning, and just about anything else that can be measured.
7.52.5.1.1.1.2	The persistence of these daily cycles in the absence of environmental time cues suggests that animals have an internal clock.
7.52.5.1.1.1.3	As we mentioned above, because these daily cycles are not exactly 24 hours long, they are known as circadian rhythms.
7.52.5.1.1.2.1	Biological rhythm can be viewed as a series of cycles, and the length of one of those cycles is the period of the rhythm.
7.52.5.1.1.2.2	Any point in the cycle is a phase of that cycle.
7.52.5.1.1.2.3	When two rhythms completely match, they are in phase, and if a rhythm is shifted (as in the resetting of a clock), it is phase-advanced or phase-delayed.
7.52.5.1.1.2.4	Because the period of a circadian rhythm is not exactly 24 hours, it must be phase-advanced or phase-delayed each day to remain in phase with the daily cycle of the environment.
7.52.5.1.1.2.5	In other words, the rhythm has to be entrained to the environmental cycle of light and dark.
7.52.5.1.1.3.1	The circadian rhythm of an animal held under constant conditions will run according to its natural period   it will be free-running.
7.52.5.1.1.3.2	If the period is less than 24 hours, the animal will begin its activity a little earlier each day (Focus: Key Figure 52.11).
7.52.5.1.1.3.3	The period of the free-running circadian rhythm is under genetic control.
7.52.5.1.1.3.4	Different species may have different average periods, and within a species, mutations can lead to different period lengths.
7.52.5.1.1.4.1	focus: key figure
7.52.5.1.1.5.1	Figure 52.11 Circadian Rhythms Are Entrained by Environmental Cues The activity   rest cycle of a laboratory mouse (a nocturnal animal) responds to the light   dark cycle under which it is kept.
7.52.5.1.1.5.2	The gray bars indicate times when the mouse is running on an activity wheel.
7.52.5.1.1.5.3	Two days of activity are represented on each horizontal line.
7.52.5.1.1.5.4	Thus, day 1 is 0   24 and day 2 is 24   48.
7.52.5.1.1.5.5	Then on the next line day 2 is replotted as 0   24 and day 3 is 24   48, and so on.
7.52.5.1.1.5.6	This double plotting is merely to make the pattern easier to see.
7.52.5.1.1.6.1	Q: In going from the last activity tracing in the second panel to the light-pulse experiment in the third panel, do this transition and its effects on the circadian clock seem more similar to what you experience if you are recovering from jet lag after traveling from San Francisco to New York, or in the opposite direction?
7.52.5.1.1.7.1	Under natural conditions, environmental time cues, such as the onset of light or dark, entrain the free-running rhythm to the light   dark cycle of the environment.
7.52.5.1.1.7.2	In the laboratory it is possible to entrain the circadian rhythms of free-running animals with short pulses of light or dark administered every 24 hours (see the bottom panel of Figure 52.11).
7.52.5.1.1.8.1	In mammals, the master circadian &#8220;clock&#8221; consists of two clusters of neurons just above the optic chiasm (the area of the brain where the optic nerves come together).
7.52.5.1.1.8.2	These structures are called the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN).
7.52.5.1.1.8.3	If they are destroyed, the animal becomes arrhythmic (loses its circadian rhythm) and is just as likely to eat, drink, sleep, or wake at any time of day.
7.52.5.1.1.9.1	A notable study by Martin Ralph and his colleagues, then at the University of Virginia, demonstrated that the SCN is the source of circadian rhythms.
7.52.5.1.1.9.2	When the SCNs of adult hamsters with typical 24-hour rhythms were destroyed, the animals became arrhythmic.
7.52.5.1.1.9.3	After several weeks of this arrhythmic behavior, the researchers transplanted SCN tissue from hamster fetuses bred for an atypical (mutant) short-day rhythmicity into the original hamsters&#8217; brains.
7.52.5.1.1.9.4	The experiment produced two remarkable results (Figure 52.12).
7.52.5.1.1.9.5	First, circadian rhythms were restored by the transplanted SCN tissue, demonstrating that the SCN is sufficient to generate circadian rhythms   a unique case of a behavior being restored by a neural transplant.
7.52.5.1.1.9.6	Second, the restored circadian rhythms had the period length of the donor strain, demonstrating that the specific phenotype of the behavior was a property of the donor neural tissue, and thus wholly generated by the SCN.
7.52.5.1.1.9.7	Figure 52.12 The Brain Clock Can Be Transplanted
7.52.5.1.1.10.1	The molecular mechanism of the circadian clock involves negative feedback loops.
7.52.5.1.1.10.2	Although there are several genes involved, including the per gene discussed in Key Concept 52.2, we can generalize about the mechanism by saying that when certain &#8220;clock genes&#8221; are expressed in SCN cells, the mRNA enters the cytoplasm, where it is translated.
7.52.5.1.1.10.3	The resulting proteins combine, and the dimer returns to the nucleus as a transcription factor that shuts off the expression of the clock genes until the transcription factor is degraded.
7.52.5.1.1.10.4	The period of this cycle is about a day.
7.52.5.1.1.10.5	These findings show that it is possible to understand circadian rhythms of behavior at all levels, from the molecular rhythm generators to the environmental stimuli that entrain them to the daily cycle of light and dark.
7.52.5.1.2.1.1	Seasonal changes in the environment present challenges to many species.
7.52.5.1.2.1.2	Most animals reproduce most successfully if they time their reproductive behavior to coincide with the most favorable time of year for the survival of their offspring.
7.52.5.1.2.1.3	Many species require considerable advance preparation for reproduction.
7.52.5.1.2.1.4	Migratory animals must arrive on their breeding grounds at the right time, and animals that have specialized structures used in mating displays, such as the antlers of deer, moose, and caribou, must grow these structures before the breeding season arrives.
7.52.5.1.2.2.1	For many species, a change in day length   the *photoperiod   is a reliable indicator of seasonal changes to come.
7.52.5.1.2.2.2	For others, however, change in day length is not a reliable seasonal cue.
7.52.5.1.2.2.3	Hibernators, for example, spend long months in dark burrows underground but must be physiologically prepared to breed almost as soon as they emerge in the spring.
7.52.5.1.2.2.4	A bird overwintering near the equator cannot use changes in photoperiod as a cue to time its migration to its temperate-zone breeding grounds.
7.52.5.1.2.2.5	When held under constant laboratory conditions, such animals show endogenous circannual rhythms that keep track of the time of year.
7.52.5.1.2.2.6	Unlike for circadian rhythms, the neural basis for circannual rhythms is unknown.
7.52.5.1.2.3.1	*connect the concepts Photoperiodism is also a common phenomenon in plants that have to anticipate seasonal changes, and many do so by being sensitive to the length of the night.
7.52.5.1.2.3.2	See Key Concept 38.2.
7.52.5.2.1.1	To locate suitable habitats, find food and mates, and avoid predators and bad weather, an animal needs to be able to find its way around its environment.
7.52.5.2.1.2	Within its local habitat, an animal can orient to landmarks.
7.52.5.2.1.3	But what if its destination is a considerable distance away?
7.52.5.2.1.1.1	Figure 52.13 Piloting
7.52.5.2.1.2.1	Most animals find their way by knowing and remembering the structure of their environment, a form of navigation called piloting.
7.52.5.2.1.2.2	Gray whales, for example, migrate seasonally between the Bering Sea and the coastal lagoons of Mexico (Figure 52.13).
7.52.5.2.1.2.3	They find their way in part by following the western coast of North America.
7.52.5.2.1.2.4	The rules are simple: keep the land on your right when traveling north and on your left when traveling south.
7.52.5.2.1.2.5	Coastlines, mountain chains, rivers, water currents, and wind patterns can all serve as piloting cues for animals.
7.52.5.2.1.2.6	But many remarkable cases of long-distance orientation and movement cannot be explained by piloting.
7.52.5.2.2.1.1	The ability to return to a nest site, burrow, or other specific location is called homing.
7.52.5.2.2.1.2	Homing can be accomplished by piloting in a known environment, but some animals that travel long distances through unfamiliar territory perform much more sophisticated homing.
7.52.5.2.2.1.3	The ability of pigeons to return to their home loft even after being transported to remote sites is well known.
7.52.5.2.2.1.4	How do they find their way home?
7.52.5.2.2.1.5	Experiments have shown that pigeons use the sun as a compass, but they can still find their way home when the sun is not visible.
7.52.5.2.2.1.6	Other experiments have shown that pigeons equipped with frosted contact lenses can find their way home, suggesting that visual cues are not essential.
7.52.5.2.2.1.7	Most amazing has been the demonstration that pigeons can detect Earth&#8217;s magnetic field and orient to it much as a human orients with a compass.
7.52.5.2.2.1.8	Taken together, the studies of homing by pigeons suggest that they can use multiple, redundant sources of directional information and can switch among those sources depending on the circumstances.
7.52.5.2.3.1.1	For as long as humans have inhabited high latitudes, they have been aware that entire populations of animals, especially birds, disappear and reappear seasonally.
7.52.5.2.3.1.2	Not until the early nineteenth century, however, were patterns of migration traced by marking individual birds with identification bands around their legs.
7.52.5.2.3.1.3	Only when individuals could be unmistakably identified was it possible to show that the same birds and their offspring returned to the same breeding grounds year after year, and that these same birds could be found during the nonbreeding season at locations hundreds or even thousands of kilometers from their breeding grounds.
7.52.5.2.3.2.1	Many homing and migrating species take direct routes to their destinations through environments they have never experienced because they use mechanisms of navigation other than piloting.
7.52.5.2.3.2.2	Humans use two major forms of navigation:
7.52.5.2.3.3.1	Distance   direction navigation requires knowing in what direction and how far away the destination is.
7.52.5.2.3.3.2	With a compass to determine direction and a means of measuring distance, humans navigate.
7.52.5.2.3.4.1	Bicoordinate navigation, also known as true navigation, requires knowing the latitude and longitude (the map coordinates) of both the current position and the destination, as well as a compass to determine direction.
7.52.5.2.3.5.1	Many animals seem to have a &#8220;compass sense&#8221; that allows them to use environmental cues to determine direction, and some seem to have a &#8220;map sense&#8221; that allows them to determine their position.
7.52.5.2.3.6.1	The behavior of some animals suggests that they are capable of bicoordinate navigation.
7.52.5.2.3.6.2	Gray-headed albatrosses (Thalassarche chrysostoma), for example, breed on oceanic islands in the Southern Hemisphere.
7.52.5.2.3.6.3	When a young albatross leaves its parents&#8217; nest, it flies widely over the southern oceans for 8   9 years.
7.52.5.2.3.6.4	After those wandering years, it reaches reproductive maturity and flies back to the island where it was raised, where it mates and builds a nest (Figure 52.14).
7.52.5.2.3.6.5	How can the bird find a tiny island in an enormous ocean after years of wandering?
7.52.5.2.3.6.6	We don&#8217;t know the answer, but the albatross provides strong circumstantial evidence that an animal can be capable of bicoordinate navigation, as were sailors before the days of global positioning satellites.
7.52.5.2.3.6.7	Figure 52.14 Coming Home
7.52.5.2.3.7.1	The ability to locate a position by calculating the angles between celestial objects such as the sun and stars and the horizon at specific times of day is called celestial navigation.
7.52.5.2.3.7.2	During the day, the sun can serve as a compass if you know what time it is, and animals can use their circadian clocks for that information.
7.52.5.2.3.7.3	This capacity has been demonstrated by &#8220;clock-shifting&#8221; experiments such as the one shown in Figure 52.15.
7.52.5.2.3.7.4	Similar experiments have shown that many animal species can orient by means of a time-compensated solar compass.

7.52.5.2.3.10.3	Ibis 94: 265   285.
7.52.5.2.3.11.1	Experiments show that pigeons use the sun to establish directions for navigation and finding food. &#8220;Clock-shifting&#8221; experiments demonstrate that the birds&#8217; circadian clocks factor into their ability to judge direction correctly based on the sun&#8217;s position.
7.52.5.2.3.12.1	HYPOTHESIS Pigeons determine compass direction from the position of the sun with respect to their internal circadian clocks.
7.52.5.2.3.13.1	METHOD
7.52.5.2.3.14.1	Place a pigeon in a circular cage from which it can see the sun and sky, but not the horizon or any other visual cue.
7.52.5.2.3.15.1	Surround the cage with multiple food bins but place food only in the southernmost bin, thus training the bird to look for food in the south.
7.52.5.2.3.15.2	(Rotating the cage but always placing the food in the southernmost bin confirms that the bird is navigating to find south. )
7.52.5.2.3.16.1	Place the trained pigeon in a room with a controlled light cycle for 2 weeks.
7.52.5.2.3.16.2	Turn the lights on at midnight and off at noon to phase-advance its circadian rhythm by 6 hours (i. e. , 6 A.M. feels like noon to the bird).
7.52.5.2.3.17.1	Return the pigeon to the circular cage under natural light and observe its food-seeking behavior.
7.52.5.2.3.18.1	RESULTS
7.52.5.2.3.19.1	A 6-hour shift in the circadian clock results in a 90-degree error in the pigeon&#8217;s orientation.
7.52.5.2.3.20.1	CONCLUSION Pigeons have the ability to determine direction using time of day and the position of the sun as a compass.
7.52.5.2.3.21.1	Many animals are normally nocturnal; in addition, many diurnal bird species migrate at night and thus cannot use the sun to determine direction.
7.52.5.2.3.21.2	The stars offer two sources of information about direction: moving constellations and a fixed point.
7.52.5.2.3.21.3	The positions of constellations (like that of the sun) change because Earth is rotating.
7.52.5.2.3.21.4	With a star map and a clock, direction can be determined using any constellation.
7.52.5.2.3.21.5	But one point that does not change position during the night is the point directly over the axis on which Earth turns.
7.52.5.2.3.21.6	In the Northern Hemisphere, the star Polaris   the &#8220;North Star&#8221;   lies in that region of the sky and reliably indicates north.
7.52.5.2.3.22.1	Stephen Emlen at Cornell University showed that birds can learn to use the stars for orientation.
7.52.5.2.3.22.2	As the time of year approaches when young birds would normally migrate to their winter range, young captive birds become more active and orient their activity in the direction they would fly.
7.52.5.2.3.22.3	How do they know that direction?
7.52.5.2.3.22.4	If these birds are raised in a planetarium with a natural star pattern, but one that does not rotate, the birds do not learn to orient, and their premigratory activity is random.
7.52.5.2.3.22.5	However, if the planetarium sky rotates, and even if it rotates around a different point than the North Star, the birds orient their premigratory activity as if the fixed point in the sky were north.
7.52.5.3.1.1	As individual animals interact, they exchange information; therefore animal behaviors can evolve into systems of information exchange, or communication.
7.52.5.3.1.2	The behaviors of individuals may become elaborated into communication signals, but only if the transmission of information benefits both the sender and the receiver.
7.52.5.3.1.3	To understand why these conditions must be met, consider male courtship displays, which can be quite bizarre, time- and energy-consuming, and involve risk.
7.52.5.3.1.4	Nevertheless, natural selection will favor them if they increase the males&#8217; probability of mating and passing on their genes.
7.52.5.3.1.5	The displays can produce that result if they convey information to the females (the receivers) about the qualities of the males as potential fathers.
7.52.5.3.2.1	Animals communicate using a variety of sensory modalities that vary in the nature of the signal produced, the specificity of the information conveyed, the speed and persistence of the signal, and its suitability in different environments.
7.52.5.3.2.2	Behavioral physiologists interested in communication must take into consideration the sensory and motor characteristics of their study animals, the physics of the communication modalities they use, and the environment in which the communication takes place.
7.52.5.3.1.1.1	Because of the diversity of their molecular structures, pheromones can communicate very specific, information-rich messages (see Key Concept 45.2).
7.52.5.3.1.1.2	Pheromones are effective day and night, and they can cover a broad range of transmission distances.
7.52.5.3.1.1.3	Pheromones used in different types of communication vary in their volatility (ease of vaporization) and diffusibility; these chemical properties are functions of the nature and size of the pheromone molecule.
7.52.5.3.1.1.4	Pheromones that act as alarm signals, for example, are highly volatile and diffusible, so their message spreads rapidly but disappears rapidly.
7.52.5.3.1.1.5	Territory-marking and trail-marking pheromones have low volatility and diffusibility and stay effective for a long time, so they can convey directional information.
7.52.5.3.1.1.6	Sex pheromones, such as that of the gypsy moth (see Figure 45.4), are intermediate in these properties, so they can spread a long distance but do not disappear rapidly.
7.52.5.3.1.2.1	Pheromones are an effective way to exchange species-specific information, and because the recipient must have the proper receptor molecule to detect the pheromone, it is not a signal that is easily intercepted by predators.
7.52.5.3.1.2.2	Pheromonal signals cannot be changed rapidly, but they can convey static, complex information.
7.52.5.3.1.2.3	Mammals that mark their territories with pheromones reveal a great deal of information about themselves: species, individual identity, reproductive status, size (indicated by the height of the marking), and how recently the animal has been in the area (indicated by the strength of the scent).
7.52.5.3.2.1.1	Visual signals offer the advantage of rapid delivery of information over considerable distances (depending on the environment and the visual acuity of the receiver); they also convey the exact position of the signaler.
7.52.5.3.2.1.2	Signal content can be enhanced by movements (as in a courtship display) or by different postures.
7.52.5.3.2.1.3	Effective visual signals, however, require sufficient light, and the receiver must be looking at the signaler.
7.52.5.3.2.1.4	Thus visual communication is not particularly useful at night or in environments that lack light, such as caves and ocean depths.
7.52.5.3.2.1.5	Some species have overcome this constraint with light-emitting mechanisms.
7.52.5.3.2.1.6	Fireflies, for example, use an enzymatic mechanism to create flashes of light.
7.52.5.3.2.1.7	By emitting flashes in species-specific patterns, fireflies advertise for mates at night.
7.52.5.3.2.2.1	Another drawback of visual signals is that they can be intercepted by other species.
7.52.5.3.2.2.2	There are predatory firefly species, for example, that mimic the flash pattern of females of other species.
7.52.5.3.2.2.3	A male that approaches the mimicking &#8220;female&#8221; becomes a meal rather than a mate.
7.52.5.3.2.2.4	Thus deception can be part of animal communication systems, just as it is part of human communication.
7.52.5.3.3.1.1	Sound cannot convey complex information as rapidly as visual signals can.
7.52.5.3.3.1.2	But acoustic signals, unlike visual signals, can be used at night and in dark environments.
7.52.5.3.3.1.3	They are not hindered by objects that would interfere with visual signals, so they can be transmitted in complex environments such as forests.
7.52.5.3.3.1.4	They are often better than visual signals at getting the attention of a receiver because the receiver does not have to be looking at the signaler for the message to be received.
7.52.5.3.3.1.5	Sounds are also useful for communicating over long distances.
7.52.5.3.3.1.6	Even though the intensity of a sound decreases with distance from the source, loud sounds can transmit information over much longer distances than visual signals can.
7.52.5.3.3.1.7	The complex songs of humpback whales, when produced at ocean depths of about 1,000 meters, can be heard hundreds of kilometers away, allowing these whales to locate one another across vast expanses of ocean.
7.52.5.3.3.1.8	Humpback whale populations that feed during the summer in the north Pacific Ocean migrate thousands of kilometers to winter breeding areas in either the eastern Pacific Ocean, the mid-Pacific Ocean (Hawaii), or the western Pacific Ocean (see Figure 54.4).
7.52.5.3.3.1.9	Long-distance communication among individuals spread over such enormous expanses of open ocean is important if they are to congregate in rather limited breeding areas at the same time of year.
7.52.5.3.3.2.1	The information content of acoustic signals can be increased by varying their frequency, as you can see in the sonograms of the species-specific song of white-crowned sparrows shown in Figure 52.7, and as you practice in your own speech.
7.52.5.3.3.2.2	However, acoustic signals place the signaler at risk for detection by predators.
7.52.5.3.3.2.3	This danger can be minimized by adjustments of frequency and signal structure that decrease the directional information the receiver can extract from the signal.
7.52.5.3.3.2.4	Alarm calls tend to be pure tones (a single frequency) without much temporal structure (starts and stops).
7.52.5.3.3.2.5	It is very difficult to localize such calls.
7.52.5.3.3.2.6	By contrast, territorial calls tend to cover a broad frequency range and have temporal structure.
7.52.5.3.3.2.7	These calls are easy to localize.
7.52.5.3.3.2.8	The frequencies and structures of acoustic signals are also adapted to specific habitats.
7.52.5.3.3.2.9	Different vegetation types, for example, have different sound-absorbing properties: pure tones at lower frequencies carry better in forests, and more complex calls at higher frequencies carry well in open habitats.
7.52.5.3.4.1.1	Animals in close contact with one another can communicate by touch.
7.52.5.3.4.1.2	A classic case of mechanosensory communication is the dance of honey bees (Apis spp. ), first described by Karl von Frisch.
7.52.5.3.4.1.3	Honey bees have a spectacular ability to navigate and can accurately communicate the location of food sources as far away as 10 kilometers.
7.52.5.3.4.1.4	When a forager bee finds food, she returns to the hive and communicates her discovery to her hivemates by performing a vigorous waggle dance in the dark hive on the vertical surface of the honeycomb.
7.52.5.3.4.1.5	Other bees follow the dancer and receive her message.
7.52.5.3.4.2.1	The waggle dance conveys information about both the distance and the direction of the food source.
7.52.5.3.4.2.2	The dancing bee repeatedly traces out a figure-eight pattern as she runs on the honeycomb.
7.52.5.3.4.2.3	She alternates half-circles to the left and right with vigorous wagging of her abdomen in the short, straight run between turns (Figure 52.16).
7.52.5.3.4.2.4	Bees use the sun as their compass, and the angle of the straight run indicates the direction of the food source relative to the position of the sun projected down to the horizon.
7.52.5.3.4.2.5	Even under cloudy conditions, the forager can provide directions to the food source because she can see polarized light.
7.52.5.3.4.2.6	The bee&#8217;s circadian clock allows the dancer to adjust her dance to take into account the sun&#8217;s movement during her return flight.
7.52.5.3.4.2.7	The clocks of the recruits enable them to adjust their flight direction to accommodate the sun&#8217;s movement.
7.52.5.3.4.3.1	Figure 52.16 The Honey Bee Waggle Dance
7.52.5.3.4.4.1	The distance to the food source is communicated by the duration of the waggle portion of the dance.
7.52.5.3.4.4.2	The farther away the food source is, the longer the duration of each waggle run.
7.52.5.3.4.4.3	When food is close to the hive, the waggle portion of the dance becomes so short that it appeared to von Frisch that it was a different dance, which he called a round dance.
7.52.5.3.4.4.4	Thus the honey bee has a dance language that communicates both the distance and the direction to a food source.
7.52.5.3.4.5.1	When challenged to prove that the bees were not simply using an odor trail to find the indicated food source, von Frisch responded with a very common sense observation.
7.52.5.3.4.5.2	Bees returning from a new food source fly around barriers such as buildings, but the recruits going out to the food source fly over the barriers in a &#8220;beeline,&#8221; which would be impossible if they were following an odor trail.
7.52.5.3.4.5.3	Careful observation is still one of the best tools for studying behavior.
7.52.5.3.5.1.1	Avoiding ambiguity is a high priority in any signaling system.
7.52.5.3.5.1.2	Signal specificity is enhanced if multiple sensory modalities are used.
7.52.5.3.5.1.3	Courtship behavior in fruit flies, for example, involves visual, tactile, chemical, and acoustic signals (see Figure 52.4A).
7.52.5.3.5.1.4	The male fruit fly orients toward the female&#8217;s line of vision (visual signal) and taps her body with his foreleg (tactile signal).
7.52.5.3.5.1.5	Upon detecting pheromones in her cuticle (chemical signal), the male begins to vibrate one wing, producing a species-specific courtship song (acoustic signal).
7.52.5.3.5.1.6	The male then extends his mouthparts to taste the female&#8217;s genitalia (chemical and tactile signals); if she is receptive, he initiates copulation.
7.52.5.3.5.1.7	If at any point sensory feedback indicates to either the male or the female that their pairing is inappropriate, the courtship abruptly ends.
7.52.5.3.5.2.1	52.5 recap
7.52.5.3.5.3.1	Biological rhythms allow an animal to anticipate changes in its environment.
7.52.5.3.5.3.2	In mammals, a circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei generates a rhythm that is entrainable by environmental information.
7.52.5.3.5.3.3	The navigational abilities of animals range from simple piloting by landmarks to distance   direction and bicoordinate navigation.
7.52.5.3.5.3.4	Behaviors may evolve into communication signals if the transmission of information benefits both the sender and the receiver.

7.52.5.3.5.12.1	Which forms of communication are most efficient for inter-individual communication and for broader population-level communication?
7.52.5.3.5.12.2	Explain your answer.
7.52.5.3.5.13.1	When behaviors involve interactions between multiple individuals, we have to consider how natural selection operates on all of the interacting parties, whether they are sending signals or receiving them.
7.52.5.3.5.13.2	This concern becomes particularly relevant in the case of social behaviors.

7.52.6.6.1	Our discussion of behavior has focused mostly on behavior in individual animals.
7.52.6.6.2	We&#8217;ve covered, for example, fixed action patterns, deprivation experiments, genetic determinants, development, and physiological mechanisms.
7.52.6.6.3	Yet most behavior takes place in a social context.
7.52.6.6.4	Social behavior and its evolution became a field of study in its own right in 1975, with the publication of E. O. Wilson&#8217;s landmark book Sociobiology.
7.52.6.7.1	focus your learning
7.52.6.8.1	Reproductive success of genetically related individuals contributes to an animal&#8217;s inclusive fitness.
7.52.6.9.1	Eusocial systems include nonreproductive members.
7.52.6.10.1	The evolution of social behavior can be analyzed using a cost-benefit approach.
7.52.6.11.1	Mating, parenting, group behaviors such as migration, and group living such as in animal colonies all involve interactions among individuals, and selection operates on all participants in these interactions.
7.52.6.1.1.1	We begin consideration of this enormous field of social behavior with mating behavior involving a single male and a single female.
7.52.6.1.1.2	Because natural selection is always operating to maximize the reproductive success of both the male and the female of the species, an amazing array of mating systems has evolved.
7.52.6.1.1.1.1	At the start of Chapter 7 you learned about the mating behavior of two species of voles.
7.52.6.1.1.1.2	Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) are monogamous, forming strong pair bonds that can last for life, and both parents participate in rearing the young.
7.52.6.1.1.1.3	In contrast, montane voles (M. montanus) are promiscuous: males mate with many females, and the young are raised by the female alone.
7.52.6.1.1.1.4	Behavioral physiologists have explained the proximate mechanisms behind these stark behavioral differences in terms of the release of neurohormones and the distribution of the receptors for those hormones in the brains of the two species.
7.52.6.1.1.1.5	The ultimate question   and the one asked here   is why two such different mating systems evolved in two species that are so closely related.
7.52.6.1.1.2.1	We begin with the premise that there is an asymmetry in the contributions of male and female animals to their offspring at the time of fertilization.
7.52.6.1.1.2.2	Females produce a limited number of eggs, and each egg is generously stocked with resources.
7.52.6.1.1.2.3	Males produce an almost infinite number of sperm, which contain next to no resources.
7.52.6.1.1.2.4	So the energetic and opportunity costs of reproduction are greater for the female than for the male.
7.52.6.1.1.2.5	In mammals this asymmetry increases throughout gestation as the female bears most of the costs.
7.52.6.1.1.2.6	By the time of birth or hatching, the female&#8217;s investment in the young is much greater than the male&#8217;s investment, and the main way for the female to maximize her fitness is to make sure her young are healthy and survive to pass on her genes.
7.52.6.1.1.3.1	The male has different options for maximizing his fitness.
7.52.6.1.1.3.2	He can simply move on after inseminating the female and seek additional mates as a means of maximizing his reproductive success   as in the case of the montane vole.
7.52.6.1.1.3.3	Or he can stay with the female he inseminated, protect her, and help care for their young   as in the case of the prairie vole.
7.52.6.1.1.3.4	Which strategy maximizes male fitness in these species depends on a number of factors that are influenced by the environment, such as the likelihood that a female and her offspring will survive without a male&#8217;s help, and a male&#8217;s likelihood of finding another fertile female.
7.52.6.1.1.3.5	Thus sociobiologists seek to quantify these factors in nature as a means of explaining observed differences in mating systems.
7.52.6.1.2.1.1	Mating systems in which a male has more than one mate generally involve a male that manages to sequester a group of females from other males.
7.52.6.1.2.1.2	The polygynous male increases his fitness by increasing the number of females in his group.
7.52.6.1.2.1.3	As you saw in Key Concept 52.4, male elephant seals accomplish this by protecting an area of beach where females give birth.
7.52.6.1.2.1.4	Male baboons do so by herding females.
7.52.6.1.2.1.5	Male red-winged blackbirds may acquire more than one mate by defending high-quality nesting territories where females prefer to build their nests.
7.52.6.1.2.1.6	Since sex ratios in all these species are close to 50:50, a large differential in male fitness is established, with some males having high reproductive success while many males have none.
7.52.6.1.2.1.7	Thus selection favors males that are successful in competing with other males to obtain and protect access to many females.
7.52.6.1.2.1.8	In general, bigger, stronger males are the winners, and sexual dimorphism in body size evolves.
7.52.6.1.2.1.9	The elephant seal is an extreme example: males may weigh more than three times as much as females.
7.52.6.1.2.1.10	When species with polygynous mating systems are compared, there is a strong correlation between the number of females a male controls and the degree of sexual dimorphism.
7.52.6.1.2.2.1	Why do females participate in these polygynous mating systems?
7.52.6.1.2.2.2	Why doesn&#8217;t a female seek out a nice, kind, noncompetitive male?
7.52.6.1.2.2.3	In some cases, such as the female elephant seal, she has no choice.
7.52.6.1.2.2.4	If a female red-winged blackbird wants to nest in an optimal territory, she will have to share the attentions of the territory owner with other females.
7.52.6.1.2.2.5	Even if the female has a choice of mates, she is likely to maximize her fitness by mating with a male that is strong and dominant enough to control a number of females.
7.52.6.1.2.2.6	Why?
7.52.6.1.2.2.7	If her mate is a dominant male, her male offspring are likely to have their father&#8217;s traits, become dominant males, and give her more grandchildren.
7.52.6.1.2.2.8	Nonrandom mate choice by females based on male characteristics produces *sexual selection.
7.52.6.1.2.2.9	An extreme result of sexual selection is the lek mating system (see Figure 52.9C), in which the only thing a male offers a female is the display of his dominance over other males.
7.52.6.1.2.3.1	*connect the concepts Charles Darwin recognized the phenomenon of sexual selection leading to the evolution of traits that could compromise the health and survival of the individual.
7.52.6.1.2.3.2	See Key Concept 21.2.
7.52.6.1.3.1.1	Mating systems in which one female mates with multiple males are relatively rare, but polyandry is seen in some birds and a few mammal species in which paternal care for the young can have a large effect on fitness.
7.52.6.1.3.1.2	An example of a polyandrous species is the golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia), a primate native to Brazil&#8217;s tropical rainforests (Figure 52.17).
7.52.6.1.3.1.3	Tamarins are small   adults weigh less than 1 kilogram and face high predation pressure.
7.52.6.1.3.1.4	Females usually give birth to twins, and newborns constitute a higher percentage of maternal weight than is typical of other primates.
7.52.6.1.3.1.5	The young also grow more rapidly than other primates, so nursing costs are high.
7.52.6.1.3.1.6	For all these reasons, young tamarins cared for by their mother alone are unlikely to survive.
7.52.6.1.3.1.7	Figure 52.17 Polyandry in a Small Primate
7.52.6.1.3.2.1	What can a male tamarin do to help guarantee his reproductive success?
7.52.6.1.3.2.2	Watching out for predators is one obvious contribution; gathering food for the female and her young is another.
7.52.6.1.3.2.3	Like other primate parents, tamarins carry their young most of the time, but most other primates have single offspring.
7.52.6.1.3.2.4	When tamarin mothers are carrying twins, they spend 92 percent of the time resting, compared with 58 percent of the time when they are not carrying young.
7.52.6.1.3.2.5	Resting is not compatible with foraging and filling the mother&#8217;s high energy requirements.
7.52.6.1.3.2.6	When a male is present, however, he carries the young about one-third of the time, so the mother has much more time for foraging and feeding.
7.52.6.1.3.3.1	If one male tamarin is helpful in protecting and raising young, then two should be even more helpful.
7.52.6.1.3.3.2	Some females can attract a second mate by being sexually receptive to him.
7.52.6.1.3.3.3	Neither male can be sure that any eventual offspring are his, so it is in the best interest of both to help in their rearing.
7.52.6.1.3.3.4	Of the tamarin families observed in field studies, only 22 percent had one male and one female, whereas 61 percent had multiple males and one female.
7.52.6.2.1.1	As humans, we readily understand the concept of extended family   brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews.
7.52.6.2.1.2	Extended families are a common form of social organization in other species as well, and members of these families may cooperate in territory defense, predator avoidance, foraging, and rearing of young.
7.52.6.2.1.3	If behavior is favored when it increases the fitness of the individual performing it, then how can we explain the evolution of social behaviors that do not lead to the performer having more offspring and that may even appear to be altruistic   benefiting another individual at a cost to the performer?
7.52.6.2.2.1	An individual&#8217;s fitness is increased by having offspring because those offspring carry the parent&#8217;s genes into the next generation.
7.52.6.2.2.2	Fitness gained by producing offspring is referred to as direct fitness.
7.52.6.2.2.3	However, an individual&#8217;s genes are carried into the next generation by more than his or her own offspring.
7.52.6.2.2.4	In diploid organisms, two offspring of the same parents share, on average, 50 percent of the same alleles, and an individual is likely to share 25 percent of its alleles with its siblings&#8217; offspring (nieces or nephews).
7.52.6.2.2.5	Therefore, by helping parents and other relatives raise their offspring, an individual increases the transmission of those shared alleles to the next generation.
7.52.6.2.2.6	Inclusive fitness is the individual&#8217;s direct fitness plus its indirect fitness: the reproductive success of the individual&#8217;s relatives, to the extent that those relatives share the individual&#8217;s alleles.
7.52.6.2.3.1	The maximization of inclusive fitness is the mechanism driving kin selection, selection for behaviors that increase the reproductive success of relatives even when they come at a cost to the performer.
7.52.6.2.3.2	One example is &#8220;helping at the nest&#8221; behavior, which was studied extensively in Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens).
7.52.6.2.3.3	Scrub-jay pairs mate for life and establish large territories, which they defend aggressively.
7.52.6.2.3.4	The mating pair may be assisted in rearing their young by three to five helpers (Figure 52.18).
7.52.6.2.3.5	The helpers guard against predators, feed the young, clean the nest, and fly with fledglings.
7.52.6.2.3.6	Why are these birds helping others rather than rearing their own young?
7.52.6.2.3.7	A long-term study established a number of important facts:
7.52.6.2.4.1	Figure 52.18 Helpers at the Nest
7.52.6.2.5.1	The helpers are prior offspring of the mating pair and are usually 1   3 years old.
7.52.6.2.6.1	Young birds that attempt to breed have almost zero reproductive success.
7.52.6.2.7.1	Mating pairs with helpers have approximately three times the reproductive success of those without helpers.
7.52.6.2.8.1	These results support the conclusion that helper scrub-jays are maximizing their inclusive fitness by helping their parents raise siblings until they are mature enough to have a reasonable probability of successfully raising their own offspring.
7.52.6.2.9.1	The concept of kin selection was formalized by W. D. Hamilton in what has become known as Hamilton&#8217;s rule.
7.52.6.2.9.2	He argued that, for an apparent altruistic behavior to be adaptive, the fitness benefit of that act to the recipient times the degree of relatedness between the performer and the recipient has to be greater than the cost to the performer.
7.52.6.2.9.3	This relationship was clearly stated years before by the eminent geneticist J. B. S. Haldane, who said during an argument about altruism that he would not be willing to risk his life to save his brother, but for two brothers or eight cousins, he would consider it.
7.52.6.3.1.1	Hamilton&#8217;s rule can be applied to explain eusociality: social groups that include nonreproductive members (that is, members that as individuals do not reproduce).
7.52.6.3.1.2	The most obvious examples of eusociality occur among the Hymenoptera, an insect group that includes wasps, bees, and ants.
7.52.6.3.1.3	In a honey bee colony, for example, the thousands of individuals in the colony are sterile females.
7.52.6.3.2.1	The key to understanding the evolution of eusociality in hymenopterans is their sex determination mechanism, haplodiploidy, in which diploid individuals are female and haploid individuals are male.
7.52.6.3.2.2	The queen carries a lifetime supply of sperm obtained during her single mating flight, and she controls whether her eggs are fertilized or not.
7.52.6.3.2.3	An unfertilized egg develops into a haploid male; a fertilized egg develops into a diploid female.
7.52.6.3.2.4	The queen&#8217;s daughters share all of their father&#8217;s genes and, on average, half of their mother&#8217;s genes.
7.52.6.3.2.5	As a result, the sterile female workers in the hive   all sisters   share, on average, 75 percent of their alleles (Figure 52.19).
7.52.6.3.2.6	The basic unit of reproductive success in eusocial insects is the creation of new colonies around a new queen.
7.52.6.3.2.7	If a new queen developed from a worker&#8217;s offspring, the worker would share fewer genes with the new queen than if the new queen developed from a sister.
7.52.6.3.2.8	Figure 52.19 Favoring Sisters over Daughters Figure 52.20 A Eusocial Mammal
7.52.6.3.3.1	Haplodiploidy is not essential for the evolution of eusociality.
7.52.6.3.3.2	Nearly all eusocial animals construct elaborate nests or burrow systems within which their offspring are reared.
7.52.6.3.3.3	Such a structure represents an enormous investment of resources.
7.52.6.3.3.4	Naked mole-rats are eusocial mammals that live in elaborate underground tunnel systems (Figure 52.20).
7.52.6.3.3.5	A colony includes 70   80 individuals but only 1 reproductive female and a few reproductive males.
7.52.6.3.3.6	The other colony members are sterile workers that dig and maintain the tunnels, guard against intruders, harvest food (tubers), and use their feces to feed the queen and her offspring.
7.52.6.3.3.7	Individuals attempting to found new colonies have a high risk of failing or being captured by predators.
7.52.6.3.3.8	When chances of individual reproductive success are practically zero, an individual can best maximize its inclusive fitness by staying with and helping maintain the colony.
7.52.6.4.1.1	Apart from their direct influences on reproductive success, social systems can contribute to survival in many ways, but they can also involve costs.
7.52.6.4.1.2	Thus the cost   benefit approach of behavioral ecology is relevant to understanding the evolution of social behavior.
7.52.6.4.2.1	An obvious example of a benefit of group living is improved foraging efficiency.
7.52.6.4.2.2	By hunting in packs, African wild dogs (see Figure 58.17) employ cooperative strategies that enable them to bring down larger prey than could a single dog.
7.52.6.4.2.3	The larger the pack, the greater the hunting success rate.
7.52.6.4.2.4	Once the prey is killed, the presence of conspecifics also reduces the risk that the wild dogs will lose their prey to larger scavengers, such as hyenas.
7.52.6.4.3.1	Living in a group can also reduce the risk of individuals becoming prey themselves.
7.52.6.4.3.2	Many small birds forage in flocks.
7.52.6.4.3.3	To test the hypothesis that flocking provides protection against predators, R. E. Kenward released a trained goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) near wild common wood-pigeons (Columba palumbus) in England.
7.52.6.4.3.4	The hawk was most successful when it attacked solitary pigeons.
7.52.6.4.3.5	Its success in capturing a pigeon in a flock decreased as the number of pigeons in the flock increased (Figure 52.21A).
7.52.6.4.3.6	The larger the flock, the sooner some individual in the flock spotted the hawk and flew away.
7.52.6.4.3.7	This escape behavior stimulated other individuals in the flock to take flight as well.
7.52.6.4.4.1	Figure 52.21 Group Living Provides Protection from Predators
7.52.6.4.5.1	Alarm calling is another means of reducing predation risk, but the caller incurs a risk cost by calling attention to itself.
7.52.6.4.5.2	Belding&#8217;s ground squirrels (Urocitellus beldingi) live in large colonies in open meadows.
7.52.6.4.5.3	When one squirrel announces the presence of a predator with loud, sharp barks, all the nearby squirrels dive into their burrows (Figure 52.21B).
7.52.6.4.5.4	Paul Sherman of Cornell University showed that callers double their risk of being preyed on   so why do they do it?
7.52.6.4.5.5	Research by Sherman and by others has shown that this altruistic behavior is a product of kin selection.
7.52.6.4.5.6	In this polygynous species, males establish large territories in the spring that include the territories of several females, whom they inseminate.
7.52.6.4.5.7	The females then drive off the males.
7.52.6.4.5.8	Female offspring settle near their mothers, so neighboring females in a colony tend to be sisters, and they defend each other&#8217;s young.
7.52.6.4.5.9	Sherman showed that males are less likely to give alarm calls than females, and that females are more likely to give alarm calls when related individuals are nearby.
7.52.6.4.6.1	Social behavior has many costs as well as benefits.
7.52.6.4.6.2	Foraging in a group may reduce the amount of food available to each individual, and the foraging individuals may interfere with one another&#8217;s foraging activities.
7.52.6.4.6.3	Individuals living in groups may face more competition for mates, as well as for food, than solitary individuals would.
7.52.6.4.6.4	A large group may actually attract the attention of predators.
7.52.6.4.6.5	And living at high population densities can increase the risk of disease transmission.
7.52.6.4.6.6	The study of disease transmission in wild animal populations is a relatively new field, but such studies have made it apparent that species living in social groups are more prone to outbreaks of disease than are solitary species.
7.52.6.5.1.1	With the publication of E. O. Wilson&#8217;s Sociobiology, applications of the concepts of evolutionary genetics to human behavior were controversial.
7.52.6.5.1.2	The intensity of the debate stemmed from false impressions that sociobiological approaches resembled previously discredited pseudoscientific movements such as social Darwinism, biological determinism, and eugenics, all of which have been used as rationales for racism and discrimination.
7.52.6.5.1.3	However, sociobiology is an objective science, questions of &#8220;what is&#8221; should not be conflated with questions of &#8220;what ought to be. &#8221; For example, we can demonstrate the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism in body size and muscle mass in humans, and we can compare this dimorphism with that in other mammals.
7.52.6.5.1.4	However, any attempt to use such data as a political or legal defense for the cultural practice of polygamy would not be science and should not be confused with science.
7.52.6.5.2.1	The fact that our biochemistry, our cell biology, physiology, and anatomy are shaped by our genes is beyond argument.
7.52.6.5.2.2	However, it is also clear that these genetically shaped characteristics are also influenced by factors such as environment, nutrition, social interactions, and culture.
7.52.6.5.2.3	Why should it be different for behavior?
7.52.6.5.2.4	Studies of identical twins reared apart have produced evidence for inheritance of uncanny similarities in behavioral propensities.
7.52.6.5.2.5	Studies of isolated human cultures around the world have also revealed remarkable similarities in social organization.
7.52.6.5.2.6	None of these studies, however, would challenge the dominant role of learning and culture in the shaping of human behavior.
7.52.6.5.3.1	52.6 recap
7.52.6.5.4.1	Social behavior can be understood by asking how it contributes to the fitness of all the individuals involved.
7.52.6.5.4.2	Asymmetry between the sexes in parental investment is a key factor in the evolution of mating systems.
7.52.6.5.4.3	According to the theory of kin selection, an individual can increase its fitness by helping related individuals with whom it shares alleles.
7.52.6.5.4.4	In extreme cases, kin selection has given rise to eusociality.
7.52.6.5.5.1	learning outcomes
7.52.6.5.6.1	You should be able to:
7.52.6.5.7.1	Apply concepts of fitness to explain the evolution of social behaviors related to reproduction.
7.52.6.5.8.1	Explain how haplodiploidy relates to eusociality.
7.52.6.5.9.1	Identify costs and benefits of social behaviors.
7.52.6.5.10.1	Explain the selective pressures that favor an individual being a helper at the nest rather than engaging in reproduction.
7.52.6.5.11.1	What is the relationship between haplodiploid sex determination and the evolution of eusociality in ants, wasps, and bees?
7.52.6.5.12.1	Many species of small birds respond to the presence of a much larger predator by joining together to mob the predator and drive it off.
7.52.6.5.12.2	What do you see as the risks and benefits of this behavior, and what hypotheses could you propose about the individuals taking part in an incidence of mobbing behavior?
7.52.6.5.13.1	investigatinglife
7.52.6.5.14.1	How does social context influence the learning and expression of birdsong?
7.52.6.5.15.1	Birdsong is the classic example of how genetic determinants, development, physiology, and learning can interact to generate and control even complex behaviors.
7.52.6.5.15.2	As you saw with the white-crowned sparrow, the nestlings must experience their species-specific song if they are going to sing it (males) and respond to it (females) as adults.
7.52.6.5.15.3	But there is a genetically determined template of what they can and will learn.
7.52.6.5.15.4	With physiological maturation, they begin to sing poorly and must hear themselves and practice to be able to sing their species-specific songs.
7.52.6.5.15.5	Social context also plays a role in learning small variations of dialects in song that may play a role in population as well as individual identity.
7.52.6.5.15.6	Social context also influences what and when singing occurs.
7.52.6.5.15.7	Singing intensifies in the presence of competitors and also potential or current mates.
7.52.6.5.15.8	The experiments by Woolley and Doupe on zebra finches showed that even though there were only small differences between songs when males sang alone or in the presence of a female, these differences were clearly recognized by females and influenced their behaviors.
7.52.6.5.15.9	Studies of birdsong emphasize the importance of considering the evolution of a behavior from the angles of all of the different individuals involved, and at the various levels of biological organization that contribute to the behavior.
7.52.6.5.16.1	Future directions
7.52.6.5.17.1	Language is considered a unique characteristic of humans.
7.52.6.5.17.2	Many animals use simple acoustical signals to communicate, but the fine motor control necessary to produce precise, fine-tuned, rapid complex vocalizations is found only in humans and songbirds.
7.52.6.5.17.3	Whereas birdsong is recognized to be elaborate but highly stereotyped territorial and mating signals, recent studies like those of Woolley and Doupe are showing that small variations in song can convey more detailed information about the identity of the individual, its intentions, and the social context in which it is behaving.
7.52.6.5.17.4	Can birdsong be used to convey more complex information?
7.52.6.5.17.5	Can birdsong be a form of simple language?
7.52.6.5.17.6	If so, we have much more to learn about the cognitive abilities of birds.
7.52.6.5.17.7	Language is used to construct our views of ourselves and of our position in our physical and social environments, and to be able to project those views into the past and into the future   the essence of consciousness.
7.52.6.5.17.8	Could birds be better models for human cognitive processes than the mammals typically used in laboratory studies?

7.52.6.5.19.1	52 Chapter Summary
7.52.summary.1.1	52.1 Ethology Led to Modern Behavioral Biology
7.52.summary.2.1	Ivan Pavlov&#8217;s discovery of conditioned reflexes and B. F. Skinner&#8217;s research on operant conditioning as a model for learning led to an approach called behaviorism that mainly carried out laboratory experiments on rats and a few other animal models.
7.52.summary.2.2	Review Figure 52.1
7.52.summary.3.1	Ethology focuses on both the proximate causes of behavior (the immediate cause of the behavior, and how the behavior develops) and the ultimate causes (how the behavior affects the animal&#8217;s evolutionary fitness).
7.52.summary.4.1	A major focus of the ethologists was fixed action patterns and their releasers.
7.52.summary.4.2	They performed deprivation experiments as well as crossbreeding experiments to demonstrate that certain behaviors are genetically determined.
7.52.summary.4.3	Review Figure 52.2
7.52.summary.5.1	52.2 Behavior Can Be Genetically Determined
7.52.summary.6.1	Genetic manipulations such as gene knockout experiments can reveal the roles of specific genes underlying a behavioral phenotype.
7.52.summary.6.2	Review Figure 52.3
7.52.summary.7.1	Most behaviors are complex traits involving many genes that function in cascades, offering many points for a change in a single gene to influence behavior.
7.52.summary.7.2	Review Figure 52.4
7.52.summary.8.1	52.3 Behavior Can Be Studied Developmentally
7.52.summary.9.1	Hormones can determine the pattern of behavior that develops and the timing of its expression.
7.52.summary.9.2	Review Figure 52.5
7.52.summary.10.1	Imprinting is a process by which an animal learns a specific set of stimuli during a limited critical or sensitive period.
7.52.summary.10.2	That critical period may be determined by hormones.
7.52.summary.11.1	The development and expression of song in white-crowned sparrows involve a genetic predisposition to learn the species-specific song, a critical period for imprinting of a song memory, and hormonally controlled timing of song expression.
7.52.summary.11.2	Social interactions may also play a role.
7.52.summary.11.3	Review Figure 52.7
7.52.summary.12.1	The ability to incorporate variations into species-specific behaviors may be important in establishing individuality and influencing mate choice.

7.52.summary.13.1	52.4 Selective Pressures Shape Behavior
7.52.summary.14.1	An animal&#8217;s behavior involves a series of choices that influence its fitness.
7.52.summary.14.2	To make these choices, animals use environmental cues that are reliable predictors of the potential effects of their choice on their fitness.
7.52.summary.15.1	The cost   benefit approach can be used to investigate the fitness value of specific behaviors.
7.52.summary.15.2	The cost of a behavior typically has three components: energetic cost, risk cost, and opportunity cost.
7.52.summary.15.3	Review Figure 52.8, Animation 52.1
7.52.summary.16.1	According to optimal foraging theory, animals should practice feeding behaviors that maximize their energetic gain at the least cost.
7.52.summary.16.2	Review Animation 52.2
7.52.summary.17.1	52.5 Behavior Can Be Studied Mechanistically
7.52.summary.18.1	Circadian rhythms control the daily cycle of behavior.
7.52.summary.18.2	Without environmental time cues, circadian rhythms free-run with a period that is genetically programmed.
7.52.summary.18.3	Circadian rhythms are normally entrained by the environmental light   dark cycle.
7.52.summary.18.4	Review Focus: Key Figure 52.11, Animation 52.3
7.52.summary.19.1	Circannual rhythms help organisms time their reproductive behavior to coincide with favorable times of year.
7.52.summary.20.1	Forms of navigation used by animals to find their way in the environment include piloting (orienting to landmarks), homing, distance   direction navigation, and bicoordinate navigation.
7.52.summary.20.2	Navigation mechanisms include celestial navigation and a time-compensated solar compass.
7.52.summary.20.3	Review Figures 52.13   52.15, Animation 52.4, Activity 52.1
7.52.summary.21.1	The behaviors of individuals may become communication signals if the transmission of information benefits both the sender and the receiver.
7.52.summary.21.2	Review Figure 52.16, Activity 52.2
7.52.summary.22.1	Chemical communication signals (pheromones) can be highly specific and have different time courses.
7.52.summary.22.2	Visual signals can convey complex messages rapidly, but only if the recipient can see the sender.
7.52.summary.22.3	Acoustic signals can travel over long distances, do not require a focused recipient, and can be modified to reveal or conceal directional information.
7.52.summary.22.4	Tactile signals can convey complex messages when animals are in close proximity.
7.52.summary.23.1	52.6 Social Interactions Shape the Evolution of Behavior
7.52.summary.24.1	Differences in parental investment can lead to different mating strategies for males and females.
7.52.summary.25.1	Polygynous mating systems, in which one male controls and mates with many females, can result in great variation in male reproductive success.
7.52.summary.26.1	Polyandry   a female mating with multiple males   can evolve in circumstances in which males make substantial contributions to the survival of offspring.
7.52.summary.27.1	The fitness an individual gains by producing offspring (direct fitness) plus the fitness it gains by increasing the reproductive success of relatives with whom it shares alleles (indirect fitness) is called inclusive fitness.
7.52.summary.27.2	Kin selection may favor altruistic behavior toward relatives, despite its cost to the performer, if it increases the performer&#8217;s inclusive fitness.
7.52.summary.28.1	As a result of haplodiploidy, the sex determination mechanism of hymenopteran insects, nonreproductive female workers (sisters) share more alleles with one another than reproductive females share with their own offspring.
7.52.summary.28.2	Review Figure 52.19
7.52.summary.29.1	Haplodiploidy has probably facilitated the evolution of eusocial behavior in the hymenopterans through kin selection.
7.52.summary.29.2	Eusociality has also arisen in diploid species in which chances of individual reproductive success are extremely low.
7.52.summary.30.1	Group living confers benefits such as greater foraging efficiency and protection from predators, but it also has costs, such as increased competition for food and ease of transmission of diseases.

7.52.summary.35.1	52.1 Behaviors have proximate and ultimate causes.
7.52.summary.36.1	52.3 Hormones influence the development of certain behaviors and their expression at a later time.
7.52.summary.37.1	52.4 The evolution of behavioral responses to the environment is driven by costs and benefits.
7.52.summary.38.1	Original Paper: Engel, K. C. et al. 2016.
7.52.summary.38.2	A hormone-related female anti-aphrodisiac signals temporary infertility and causes sexual abstinence to synchronize parental care.
7.52.summary.38.3	Nature Communications 7: 1   10.
7.52.summary.39.1	Burying beetles are called nature&#8217;s undertakers because they bury the remains of small dead animals.
7.52.summary.39.2	These animal bodies serve as food for the beetles&#8217; young.
7.52.summary.39.3	A mating pair of beetles typically meets over a fresh animal carcass, copulates, and buries the carcass.
7.52.summary.39.4	The female lays fertilized eggs in the soil above the carcass.
7.52.summary.39.5	Some 50   60 hours later, the eggs hatch and both parents spend the next 3 days eating from the carcass and regurgitating the partially digested material to feed their young.
7.52.summary.39.6	After 3 days, the larvae feed themselves.
7.52.summary.40.1	Researchers used these beetles to study trade-offs in time and energy investments between brood care and production of new broods.
7.52.summary.40.2	Both activities are demanding, so how do the beetles control their apportionment of energy?
7.52.summary.40.3	The researchers provided female beetles with mating partners and carcasses to stimulate egg laying.
7.52.summary.40.4	There were three treatment groups: (1) no larvae group: just as the eggs hatched, the new hatchlings were removed and the parents were presented with a new carcass; (2) new larvae group: just after their eggs hatched, the parents were left with 10 larvae and given a new carcass; and (3) old larvae group: 4 days after their eggs hatched and they had cared for their hatchlings, the parents were presented with a new carcass.
7.52.summary.40.5	The researchers measured the number of females in each group that produced eggs.
7.52.summary.40.6	The results are shown in Figure A.
7.52.summary.41.1	The researchers measured juvenile hormone (JH) levels present at various times in the breeding cycles of females with and without larvae.
7.52.summary.41.2	Juvenile hormone is known to suppress the fertility of the females.
7.52.summary.41.3	The results are shown in Figure B.
7.52.summary.42.1	The researchers also measured the effects of a possible pheromone, methyl geranate, on the beetles&#8217; sexual behavior.
7.52.summary.42.2	Methyl geranate is a volatile compound that shares the same biosynthetic pathway with juvenile hormone.
7.52.summary.42.3	The researchers recorded whether or not males copulated with females and the amount of methyl geranate emitted by those females.
7.52.summary.42.4	Figure C summarizes these results.
7.52.summary.42.5	The data points represent meetings resulting in copulation or not.
